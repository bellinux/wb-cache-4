This is a qualitative research of phenomenological nature, it was approved by the Ethics in Research Committee, Protocol 139 / 2010. It was conducted with patients with cancer in a general hospital, located in Alfenas, in March and April, 2011. The research began from these guiding questions: <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the recreational team work and the activities they do? What do you suggest for this group to be developed? It was perceived that ludic activities help patients to face the disease, that they eased the interaction between the recreational group and the multiprofessional team, besides providing a happy and welcoming environment. The most well accepted activities were music and games the clowns provided. We suggest implementing the humanization by using ludic resources...|$|E
40|$|Aims/ Intent: Historical French Salons {{aimed to}} provide a venue for {{intellectual}} discourse. Transcending time, present day salons and Socratic Cafés provide a creative outlet for artists, scientists and philosophers to exchange ideas and advance thought and creativity. The salon venue provides a means to both embrace and distance from peer review; at times analytical distance is necessary for advancement of thought and idea (Sawhney, 2013). This forum will briefly discuss the history of salons, their use in present day society, and articulate the potential for advancing ideas in occupational science. The session will end with a brief, one hour salon to explore pre-identified and emerging ideas related to occupational science and potential future directions for the national and global research societies and {{for the advancement of}} the state of the science. Rationale: In an era that has seen a growth in OS research societies around the world, occupational science literature has also expanded to include text books, journals, blogs, and informal means of idea exchange. The salon forum is a unique means to provide reflection (Petty, 2010) and idea exchange beyond the traditional conference format. Outcomes: From this session participants will: 1 - Describe the history and format for salons and their potential to advance occupational science. 2 - Engage in a salon based discussion designed to advance ideas related to national and global efforts to grow and disseminate knowledge of occupational science. 3 - Acquire the skills to utilize a historical methodology with the values of collaboration and critical discourse designed to facilitate sharing and perspective taking to serve humanity. Discussion Questions (*Note, the salon is designed to generate the questions; these are guiding discussion suggestions) 1 - Discuss the state of occupational science and suggestions for future directions for the global societies, discourse, and research. 2 - What recommendations would you have for the future of educational efforts in occupational science? 3 - How do our students best come to know and understand occupational science? 4 - <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the state of occupational science and how it needs to be nurtured in its growth to meet the needs of society...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Purpose: Institutionalized {{adults with}} {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID), a disability community {{who has a}} long history of enduring grave injustices and whose voices have been absent in occupational science discourse, continue to face barriers to meaningful participation in occupation (Mahoney, Roberts, Bryze, 2 ̆ 6 Parker Kent, 2016). Additionally, adults with ID are impacted by policies designed with inconsistent and contradictory values influenced by the concurrent adoption of principles from various models of practice and constructions of disability (Channon, 2014); therefore, there is a need to better understand how opportunities for meaningful participation for adults with ID are situated within and influenced by these systems and ruling relations. This paper draws on data from an institutional ethnographic study aimed to make visible the inter-relational ways national, state, and local policies mediate the possibilities for meaningful participation in occupation for adults with ID. Methods: Institutional ethnography (Smith, 2005) was used as the social theory and methodology for this study. The aim of institutional ethnography is to make visible the systems and social relationships through which occupations emerge and are coordinated (Prodinger, Rudman, 2 ̆ 6 Shaw, 2015). Data were collected at a residential facility. Participants included seven adults diagnosed with profound ID and eight adult staff members. Participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and text work were the main sources of data. Narrative analysis was used to systematically relate meanings and interpretations of participants’ experiences to particular narratives on work in an institutional setting. Mapping, as a second analytic process, was used to analyze institutional practices and connect them back to the policies that coordinated work and other activities of the center (Campbell 2 ̆ 6 Gregor, 2004). Results: Analyses revealed the systems and structures through which staff work was coordinated created a systematic regulation of participation in meaningful occupation. More specifically, analyses demonstrated how institutional policies placed greater value on routinization and efficiency over self-determined participation. These findings not only highlight the lack of opportunities for residents and staff to incorporate occupations of their choosing, they call attention to the ways institutional routinization is a perpetuation of the historical notions of what adults with ID should do. Implications for Occupational Science: This study contributes enhanced knowledge about the lived experiences of institutionalized adults with ID and how opportunities to participate in occupations are supported or thwarted by textually-mediated social practices, and challenges the discipline’s theoretical assumptions on participation. Key words: participation, ruling relations, institutional ethnography Discussion Questions: 1. Smith (2005) asserts that social control is increasingly discursive and textual. How might occupational scientists use mapping as a tool to address critical issues of choice and participation? 2. How does Smith’s (2005) construct of “ruling relations” add to our conceptualization of participation? Have occupational scientists given adequate attention to how texts impact participation? 3. This year’s conference theme charges the discipline to navigate the seas of change. I would argue that one way to increase the diversity of occupation (and participation) is to expand the ways we capture experience. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the contributions of narrative as method and narrative as analysis in occupational science...|$|E

40|$|Title: Morning Routines: Revelations about Participation – Year 4 Statement of purpose: Morning {{routines}} {{are critical}} to setting {{the flow of the}} entire day. Analysis of the literature reveals a lack of information related to the morning routines of persons with disabilities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to focus attention on the importance of morning routines, to add descriptive information regarding the morning routines of persons with chronic disabilities, and to further developing the construct of morning routines. Description of methods: Participants included a convenience sample of eleven individuals with a chronic disability and ten individuals without known disabilities. Qualitative cross-case analysis was used to initially code and analyze the data collected through the photo-elicited interviews. Grounded Theory and constant comparative analysis were used to further analyze emerging themes/constructs as data was collected over the four-year period. Unstructured and semi structured interviews were conducted using the participant-generated photographs to guide questioning. Although this research was strictly qualitative, numerical trends seen within the data collected were observed and will be reported. Report of results: The following parts of a morning routine emerged from the coding: Occupations/activities, Objects, Temporality, Context, Pleasure and Motivation. Morning routines as a construct will be put forward and described. Notable differences between persons with and without disabilities included the number of medical objects used, critical placement of objects, temporal differences, and for those who were retired – activity and physical context differences. In particular, individuals with chronic disabilities who were retired were missing a key part of the morning/daily routine most retirees enjoy – volunteering. Implications related to occupational science: Routines are the underlying support for daily occupations. Understanding and describing routines will add to basic knowledge in occupational science. As our basic knowledge of occupation expands, we can do the more complex research. Discussion questions to further occupational science concepts and ideas: 1. <b>What</b> should <b>be</b> the next direction for researching morning routines? 2. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> about impact of chronic disabilities on participation in the retired population? 3.

Exactly one year ago we were struggling with the exact same problematic. Looking through the objective lens of a microscope can be very challenging in the beginning. After putting enormous effort and time into understanding basic histology, the idea arose to create something that makes histology not necessarily easier itself, but easier to understand. Fortunately our idea was appreciated by the histology department, so we started {{to work on the}} first concept. It is particularly important to mention that this atlas is made out of the student’s perspective. Our experience was that highly trained histologists/pathologists have a totally graduated perception of the material. Even acknowledged books had difficulties simplifying things in the beginning to solve the most basic problems of understanding the perspective. With the support of the histology department of UMF Timisoara and their technologies, we were able to realize our ideas and produce the best possible outcome. This histology atlas is specifically structured to mediate all basic steps for understanding and analysing the four basic types of tissue. We especially want to thank Prof. Univ.

Cue: When {{you hear}} of pest control, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> first <b>thought?</b> Perhaps {{you think of}} someone using a sprayer, or {{sprinkling}} a chemical solution onto plants using a broom. But {{there are many ways}} to protect crops from pests, and farmers can achieve very good control if they learn how to combine different strategies. This approach is commonly known as Integrated Pest Management, or IPM for short. So <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the difference between management of pests and simply killing them, for example by using a pesticide? John Nderitu is Dean of Nairobi University?s Faculty of Agriculture. Recently, he spoke to Winnie Onyimbo about some of the different methods that together, make up an integrated approach to pest management. Methods that may all the difference to winning the battle against very tricky pests? IN:	?Well we have pests like bean fly? OUT:	?only managing the pest itself. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 51 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Professor John Nderitu of the University of Nairobi. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Nderitu	Well we have pests like bean fly, where we combine cultural control in combination with pesticide and also using varieties that are less attacked. All those now I am saying there are about three of those combinations, and they can be effective rather than using one in isolation. Onyimbo	Let?s go into the details of the different approaches like cultural and genetic. <b>What</b> exactly <b>are</b> you talking about? Nderitu	Well, cultural is where you use some agronomic practices that are normally done by farmers, like ridging, planting time, plant density, even intercropping, or like companion cropping; those methods that farmers have used themselves, they may have not been intentional, but we have currently tested them and found them to be effective. Even the use of aspects like the use of ash on controlling the bruchids on beans in storage, or the use of soil on maize funnels for control of the maize stalk borer. Those are some of the cultural practices that farmers have used to control the pests. Or use of even cow dung to control the beetles on maize, the black beetles on maize in western Kenya. Onyimbo	And the others what about the genetic one, the chemical one? Nderitu	We have of course the varietal control where certain varieties are affected differently by a particular pest, and some may be tolerant, some might be resistant and some may be susceptible. So we go for tolerant and resistant varieties which can be able to reduce the population and therefore the damage on the crop. Of course there are also the chemicals, where in IPM we would also advocate the use of chemicals. Chemicals that are environmentally safe, chemicals that are selective to the pest they attack so that they do not attack other organisms in the environment. Chemicals that are safe to humans beside other aspects and chemicals that will be able to be selective on natural enemies that we have in the field and also chemicals that have minimum residue levels. Onyimbo	How is IPM environment friendly? Nderitu	The concept of IPM came in mainly with a reduction of use of insecticides. And the insecticides are the most pollutant in the environment. So IPM is a reduction of use of pesticides for controlling pests and therefore it is implied that it is directly an environmental strategy. Of course we have also biological control where you are using natural enemies. It means if it is a pest, an insect pest, you use other insects which are predators or parasites on those pests or you use the insect pathogens, diseases of those insects and multiply them to ensure that we can control the pest by use of diseases. Besides that, we have both the physical and mechanical control, in form of issues like use of greenhouses. It is a method that can be able to reduce insects from outside the greenhouse and we ensure that whatever is inside can be directly controlled and you prevent further infestation from outside. That is one reason why greenhouses are part and parcel of IPM in horticultural production. Onyimbo	How different is IPM from other ways of managing pests? Nderitu	IPM is a combination of methods, methods that are compatible, methods that are integrated. Other methods are individual: you may use them individually, but in IPM we try to use as much combination or methods that are effective as much as possible. Because IPM quite often is recognising that pests will still be there after you control them. <b>Your</b> only importance <b>is</b> reducing them to an economic level, that you are able to produce a crop in the presence of the minimum infestation in the crop. Other methods like chemical control may be targeted to extermination or removal totally of the pest. But this IPM is recognising that it is very? You may not completely eradicate a pest from a crop, it is only managing the pest itself. End of trackAn explanation that IPM uses a combination of strategies to manage pest...|$|R
