25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E

Geraldine Ferraro, then a member of the United States House of Representatives, wrote the introduction to the briefing.

Melanie's intellect, one of her defining characteristics, earned her the nickname [...] "Med School". VIBE Vixen's Jennifer Hickman referred to Melanie as [...] "bookwormy", and Virginia Heffernan characterized her as [...] "wholesome and a good student" [...] in the pilot. Heffernan called the character a [...] "kind of Cosby Show figure" [...] due to her initial reluctance to join the Sabre Sunbeams.|$|E
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film.

[...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with the chance elements to our life and that's kind of {{the embodiment of the}} feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E

500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Lundgren {{planned on}} playing a {{supporting}} role, {{with a more}} famous actor in the lead. He also considered directing the film, but decided against it, as he desired {{to learn more about}} producing. In 2013, Lundgren announced the casting of Tony Jaa, in the role of Tony Vitayakul; and Ekachai Uekrongtham as the director. Lundgren chose Uekrongtham after being impressed with his film, Beautiful Boxer. He contacted him through a mutual friend in Los Angeles, and in mid-2013, they arranged to meet in the city. While he had previously turned down scripts offered to him for international markets, Uekrongtham found Skin Trade [...] "riveting". He said the script [...] " [...] the potential to work as a character-driven piece while saying something about how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with scars, literal and otherwise". Jaa, on the other hand, met with Lundgren through his manager and film agent. He couldn't speak any English when cast, but claimed to have taken [...] "intensive" [...] lessons in preparation for his role; stating he is now [...] "reasonably fluent" [...] in [...] "conversational" [...] English.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} first draft, Spotnitz and Carter decided to {{reintroduce}} Donnie Pfaster, a character {{from the second}} season episode [...] "Irresistible". Carter noted that, [...] "we had talked about possibly revisiting some old monster this season, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity." [...] The writers and producers decided to take [...] "Orison" [...] in a [...] "substantial new direction". Although Donnie Pfaster was originally portrayed as a [...] "death fetishist", his nature was non-supernatural. In [...] "Orison", however, {{it was decided to}} make Pfaster into a true demon. Shiban explained [...] "we decided late in the process to turn him into this totally demonic character, essentially evil as an entity." [...] Spotnitz was very excited about bringing closure to the Pfaster-Scully story. He explained, [...] "For me, what really justified bringing Donnie back was the final act of the script when Donnie comes for Scully and she ends up shooting him full of holes." [...] The final scene, however, proved difficult to script. Director Rob Bowman noted, that the act [...] "was a tough scene.

500|$|Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post {{called the}} episode [...] "deeply unsettling" [...] on purpose. She said that [...] "Violence against women was inescapable in this episode, but what made Mad Mens {{exploration}} of the topic worthwhile and compelling {{was the fact that}} two women in this episode asserted their power and control over their lives. It wasn't a story about helplessness and victimization; it was an episode about everything from sweaty discomfort to outright terror, and how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with those emotions." [...] John Swansburg, writing for Slate, said the episode was a [...] "dud," [...] with the fever dream a [...] "very obvious (and not particularly enlightening) way to depict Don wrestling with his infidelity issues." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Baltimore Sun compared [...] "Mystery Date" [...] to a Stephen King novel. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times admitted that the dream sequence was [...] "heavy-handed" [...] but that [...] "there’s also something terribly convincing about the link 'Mystery Date' posits between Don’s seemingly insatiable sexual appetite and his personal demons.

500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how <b>we</b> <b>deal,</b> that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E

Fortunately, those species with which we are most concerned are those not on the endangered species list at the present time. Many Ohio farmers would like to see the Red-winged Blackbird on the endangered species list, I think, but it is not there.
