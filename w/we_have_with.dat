25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger {{that is at the}} heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion {{is at the heart of}} this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{shows an}} aproned matriarch presenting a roasted turkey {{to a family}} of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation of family values. The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval {{from the head of}} the table, which is the central element of the painting. Its creased tablecloth shows that this is a special occasion for [...] "sharing what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> those we love", according to Lennie Bennett. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be cranberry sauce. There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered casserole dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2013, the {{relationship}} between the two nations was strained due to allegations of spying. In response, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said of the bilateral relations: [...] "I will never say or do anything that might damage the strong relationship and the close cooperation that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Indonesia, which is all in all our most important relationship." [...] Indonesia then froze ties with Australia, as Abbott refused to apologise. Indonesians then protested Australia's actions, including burning the flag of Australia as Australians were warned to be vigiliant in the country.|$|E
2500|$|Life {{magazine}} sent correspondents to {{the conflict}} and on August 14, 1950 put [...] "Uncle John" [...] Hoskins on the cover and profiled his career at some length. The article made much of Hoskins's [...] "homely" [...] language, his excellent relationship with the officers and men serving under him, and his pragmatic and dogmatic approach to the mission. Hoskins complimented the extraordinary interservice teamwork: [...] "You can't say enough about the fine cooperation and coordination <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the Air Force." [...] He also praised the efforts of his carrier division, saying [...] "It's wonderful to manage a team when every player gets a hit every time {{he comes to the}} plate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cain {{supports}} Israel, {{and believes}} that the US should aid Israel in defending itself. [...] After President Obama said that {{the starting point of}} negotiations for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians should be based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, Cain said: I was shocked at the president's position, and I was equally shocked that he would unilaterally suggest that Israel would move the borders back which they acquired 44 years ago. [...] This president threw Israel under the bus, there is no way around it. It demonstrates once again the arrogant disregard of this president for the opinion of the American people who like the relationship <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Israel, and for Israel having the right to make its own decisions.|$|E

2500|$|Baron Lefroy then {{proceeded}} to pass sentence. He denied that the jury had been packed, reiterated the offences mentioned in the indictment, and concluded by saying:— [...] "I wish you to understand [...] that <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>with</b> the utmost anxiety, and {{with a view to}} come to a decision upon the measure of punishment which it would be our duty to impose, postponed the passing of sentence upon you till this morning. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the utmost deliberation, examined the matter, with an anxiety to duly discharge the duty which we owe on all hands— the duty which we owe the prisoner of not meting out punishment beyond the just measure of the offence, and the duty we owe to the public that the degree of punishment will be such as to carry out the object of all punishment, which is not the mere infliction of the penalty upon the person convicted, but the prevention of crime—that that punishment should carry with it a security to the country, as far as possible, that one who has offended so perseveringly—that so deliberate a violator of the law shall not be permitted to continue his course of conduct to the disturbance of its peace and prosperity. We had to consider all this—to look at the magnitude of the crime, and to look also at the consideration that if this were not the first case brought under the Act, our duty might have obliged us to carry out the penalty it awards to the utmost extent; but taking into consideration {{that this is the first}} conviction under the Act—though the offence has been as clearly proved as any offence of the kind could be—the sentence of the court is that you, John Mitchel, be transported beyond the seas for the term of fourteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guthrie {{identified}} as a registered Republican in 2008. He endorsed Texas Congressman Ron Paul for the 2008 Republican Party nomination, and said, [...] "I love this guy. Dr. Paul is the only candidate I know of who would have signed the Constitution of the United States had he been there. I'm with him, because {{he seems to be}} the only candidate who actually believes it has as much relevance today as it did a couple of hundred years ago. I look forward to the day when we can work out the differences <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the same revolutionary vision and enthusiasm that is our American legacy." [...] He told The New York Times Magazine that he is a Republican because, [...] "We had enough good Democrats. We needed a few more good Republicans. We needed a loyal opposition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Faulkner and Randall {{explained}} {{the game was}} still utilizing the Omen Engine, with Faulkner saying of programming for the PlayStation 2 [...] "The PS2 is certainly good at pushing polys, no doubt about that. And the two vector processors can handle the physics and geometry <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> room to spare. The trick is the video memory, mainly. All of the cool visual features, like a high-res framebuffer, FSAA and high-res textures all {{take a lot of}} video memory. It's a real juggling act trying to get it to do all that at once." [...] Faulkner explained [...] "the PS2 math capabilities are like Intel's SSE, but on steroids. The math processors can be used to optimize any kind of math operations, which, in a 3D game, means a lot. So they will basically be used to speed up a lot of the 3D transformations and lighting." ...|$|E

But think ye, Christian men, that these abominations may be suffered without a sword drawn? without a shot fired? without blood spilt, yea, on the very stairs of the pulpit?

2500|$|In April 2006, Kimisopa was {{shifted from}} the {{internal}} security portfolio {{to the role of}} Minister for Justice. He announced his opposition to the death penalty in his new role, declaring [...] "killing Papua New Guineans is out of my calendar" [...] and expressing concern about the state of forensic facilities in death penalty cases. He split with his government over the Julian Moti extradition, declaring that [...] "the law should take its course and diplomatic sensitivities should not override that", in contrast to Prime Minister Somare's staunch opposition, and stating that Moti's escape from Papua New Guinea [...] "compromises the integrity of this nation" [...] He suggested that if the government of the Solomon Islands were found to {{have been involved in the}} escape, that Papua New Guinea would [...] "now critically have to assess our relationship in terms of the bilateral relationship <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the Solomon Islands". In November, it was reported that Kimisopa may be sacked as Minister for Justice over his position on the Moti affair; however, this did not occur.|$|E
2500|$|SAI {{filed for}} {{protection}} from creditors under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in June 2006. At that time the company stated that it needed an investment of US$5.5M to continue production. The company {{was not able to}} secure the capital in Canada and indicated at that time that it might have to relocate production to attract financing from other sources. CEO Paul Costanzo indicated that factors involved in this situation included the dramatic fall in value of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar between 2003–2006, start-up and product improvement costs that were greater than expected and especially a venture capital environment in the Province of Quebec that Costanzo described as [...] "dismal". He stated at the time, [...] "We have simply been unable to attract sufficient capital to allow us to effectively exploit the obvious opportunity that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the SA-160, let alone fund our planned development of a diesel two-place and a four-place product." [...] He indicated then that the company was focusing on certification of the SA-160's glass cockpit installation along with product cost reduction measures.|$|E
2500|$|Romalis again {{encountered}} {{the results of}} illegal abortions in 1962, during his internship at Cook County Hospital in Illinois, when he spent a month on the septic obstetrics ward. He recalls that in those days hospitals had entire wards {{for the victims of}} complications of pregnancy, and ninety percent of them had complications of septic abortion. [...] The ward had about 40 beds plus extra beds lining the halls for the overflow. Each day, the hospital admitted 10-30 patients with septic abortion. Each morning, the interns prepared 40 - 60 litres of intravenous fluid containing tetracycline, oxytocin and ergometrine for inocoming patients. Thanks to the discovery of antibiotics, only about one woman died each month. The cause was usually septic shock associated with hemorrhage. In the mid-1970s, a US report revealed a large drop in maternal mortality since abortion was legalized. David Boyes, a founder of BC’s Pap test program, told Romalis that the numbers were straightforward and “it suggests that politicians, with a few strokes of a pen, have saved more lives than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> twenty-five years of effort screening for cervical cancer.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Reaction to {{the album}} in the U.S. was more {{enthusiastic}} {{than it had}} been for Byrdmaniax but still wasn't wholly positive. [...] Andy Mellen, reviewing the album in the Winnipeg Free Press in February 1972, noted [...] " [...] not being anywhere the equal of Younger Than Yesterday or even Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, it is an encouraging LP, offering some assurance that Roger McGuinn and friends still have their fingers on the pulse of what's happening musically in 1972." [...] Ben Gerson commented on both the band and the album in the March 1972 issue of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "There is a programmatic certainty to their music at this point which at first glance happily signifies that a first-generation band has successfully remade itself, but, after repeated exposure disappoints one with its inflexibility." [...] Gerson concluded his review of Farther Along by commenting [...] "This is not an outstanding album, either by Byrds or contemporary standards, though, for at least a Byrds fan, it contains several seductive tunes and some exemplary musicianship. But beneath the old Byrds sound, and this new, quartered approach, there is a more fundamental commitment, and that is to survival." [...] The question of The Byrds' continued existence was also echoed in a contemporary review by Bud Scoppa in the March 1972 edition of Rock magazine, in which he opined [...] "The Byrds recognized their failure on Byrdmaniax, but placed the blame on the lavish production job rather than their own disunity. [...] So what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Farther Along, evidently rushed out to rectify the problems caused by the last LP, is more disunity, but this time in a basic unadorned state." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
