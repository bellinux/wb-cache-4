5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural <b>waterproof</b> covering for its surface, and a dense, <b>waterproof</b> core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang period {{employed}} complex chemical formulas for {{an array}} of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a <b>waterproof</b> and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, fireproof cement for glass and porcelain wares, a <b>waterproof</b> cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as porcelain was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.|$|E
5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} to selling {{underwater}} electrical detonators and <b>waterproof</b> cable of his own invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's <b>waterproof</b> cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E

Accordingly the type and the method of <b>waterproofing</b> required may vary with the location & exposure conditions. In the construction industry, many commercially available materials are used for <b>waterproofing</b> roof slabs. Under this research, field surveys were carried out to identify the types of <b>waterproofing</b> material, different methods of applications & quality controlling measures related to <b>waterproofing.</b> Furthermore, issues related to <b>waterproofing</b> were studied to identify common problems, which can be arrived in a functioning building. Then the rectifying methods and their performance related to such issues were also studied. A laboratory test series was performed on commercially available <b>waterproofing</b> materials to check their suitability. For this both liquid applied <b>waterproofing</b> materials and admixture type <b>waterproofing</b> materials were used. Three specimens were prepared using each <b>waterproofing</b> materials. They were checked for water absorption under laboratory condition for 24 hrs. Two types of water absorption tests were done to study the effectiveness of the selected <b>waterproofing</b> materials. Furthermore specimens with integral admixtures were tested under compressive strength test to identify any increase in their compressive strength due to crystalline formation. Finally from the experiment it is concluded that liquid applied <b>waterproofing</b> systems perform better than the integral <b>waterproofing</b> systems. Among the used <b>waterproofing</b> materials, K 11 flex <b>waterproofing</b> coating showed better performance than the other materials. And also compressive strength has been slightly increased of specimens with admixtures...|$|R

The results of the survey indicate that a common cause of water damage usually is related to poor product installations.

The conclusions drawn from the report indicates that several things are to be improved with the current <b>waterproofing</b> products. Most of the studied cases showing damage were due to poor installation.
