500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far as I could see, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Matheos asked Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt {{to write}} lyrics and perform vocals on one track, which would become [...] "Stockholm". Matheos and Moore sent him the track {{they wanted him}} to work on, and he sent back a rough mix of his vocals. [...] "We were really happy with it," [...] Moore said. [...] "We didn't do any {{revisions}} or ask for any changes, like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> to... It was a different approach than I would have taken, and that's what was refreshing about it. That's why we wanted to get somebody else to do some vocals on the album." [...] Tim Bowness of No-Man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on [...] "No Celebrations", a bonus track.|$|E
500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard {{gave the}} single a mixed review, stating that Minaj, being [...] "one {{of the most}} {{visually}} distinctive rappers to come along in years", that the single was an [...] "anticlimatic coming out song", [...] "considering the hype Minaj has generated through mixtapes, cameos and her co-starring role in Lil Wayne's Young Money project". However Hererra did commend the lyrical content, stating [...] "her sassy one-liners are as entertaining as always", and the overall production although it didn't suit Minaj's [...] "her mental-patient delivery nearly as well as, say, Kane Beatz' simpler track for Young Money's [...] "BedRock". Robbie Daw of 'Idolator' said, [...] "we wouldn’t expect Nicki to do any less than {{come out of the}} gate charging full force, lyrically, on her debut single. That said, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> maybe a tad more of a melody on the track." [...] Chris Ryan of 'MTV Buzzworthy' gave the song a positive review, stating [...] "you get the feeling, listening to the song's air-raid keyboards and thunderous beats, that the Young Money princess really wants to separate herself from the rap pack and carve out a space all her own". Ryan also said, [...] "her verbal dexterity, complex flow and humor, Nicki is reminiscent of classic Missy Elliott -- and that's a compliment of the highest order".|$|E

2500|$|The {{impact of}} boho {{illustrated}} certain broader trends in what Shane Watson {{referred to as}} [...] "the way we dress now": that fashion was increasingly being dictated, not by the main houses, but what Watson called [...] "the triple-F crowd" [...] (the F referring to the f's in [...] "famous and fashion-forward"), of which Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan and Sienna Miller were exemplars. Once they had spotted new fashions, young women were not prepared to wait a season for them to become available and, consequently, the familiar boundaries between summer wear and that for autumn and winter were becoming blurred. As Jane Shepherdson, brand director of the clothing chain Topshop, put it, [...] "when Sienna wore that gilet, we had to pull them forward fast ... She was doing boho in the autumn, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> {{it to be a}} trend for the following spring. Girls see it and they want it immediately".|$|E

60|$|December 28.--Stuck to my work. Mr. Scrope came to dinner, and {{remained}} next day. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> young Percival and his wife, once my favourite and beautiful Nancy M'Leod, {{and still a}} very fine woman; but they came not.|$|E

60|$|What else this unhappy {{woman was}} to do, I failed to hear. Mr. Finch {{disappeared}} with her, {{round the corner}} of the house.

6000|$|... "No, my lad," [...] said Psmith, [...] "since you ask, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not. And why? Because the air up here is refreshing, {{the view}} pleasant, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> {{at any moment}} an {{important}} communication from Comrade Gooch." ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{had had a}} {{consuming}} desire, {{from the}} beginning, to see a pony-rider, but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out of the windows. But now <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> one along every moment, and would see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims: ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah, dear, {{how little}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> what {{happened}} then! We were aghast {{to hear her}} say what she said. She was standing in a reverent attitude, with her head down and her hands clasped in front of her; for she was always reverent toward the consecrated servants of God. When the spokesman had finished, she raised her head and set her calm eye on those faces, not any more disturbed by their state and grandeur than a princess would have been, and said, with all her ordinary simplicity and modesty of voice and manner: ...|$|E

5000|$|We {{know of no}} scientifically ascertainable ideals. To be sure, {{that makes}} our efforts more arduous than in the past, since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> to create our ideals from within our breast in the very age of subjectivistculture. Max Weber, 1909 ...|$|R
