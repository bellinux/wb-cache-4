As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the <b>warrant</b> was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a <b>warrant</b> was issued on 4 April 1910, but the <b>warrant</b> could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony.

40|$|By {{empirical}} studies of Chinese <b>warrants</b> pricing, we find there are systematic devi-ations in <b>warrants</b> price that call <b>warrants</b> are under valued and put <b>warrants</b> are over valued. Using high frequency data, we do further researches {{about the reasons}} of sys-tematic deviations according to the prospect theory and resell option theory owing to heterogeneous beliefs. The main reason caused the systematic deviations is the asym-metries in the risk exposure of <b>warrants</b> issuers. These asymmetries make the reference price of PT/MA investors low for call <b>warrants</b> issuers and high for put <b>warrants</b> issuers. These factors cause the systematic deviations in Chinese <b>warrants.</b> Individual specula-tion behaviors can explain only small parts of <b>warrants</b> price deviations. consequently, we think the main reason caused systematic price deviations is <b>warrants</b> creation mecha-nism, which create defective <b>warrants,</b> rather than only caused by individual investors’ speculative behaviors...|$|R

5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without <b>warrant</b> {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a <b>warrant,</b> for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

40|$|Turbo <b>warrants</b> have {{experienced}} huge growth since they {{first appeared in}} late 2001. In some European countries, buying and selling turbo <b>warrants</b> constitutes 50 % of all derivative trading nowadays. In Asia, the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited (HKEx) introduced the callable bull/bear contracts, which are essentially turbo <b>warrants,</b> to the market in 2006. Turbo <b>warrants</b> are special types of barrier options in which the rebate is calculated as another exotic option. It is commonly believed that turbo <b>warrants</b> are less sensitive to the change in volatility of the underlying asset. Eriksson (2005) has considered the pricing of turbo <b>warrants</b> under the Black-Scholes model. However, the pricing and characteristics of turbo <b>warrants</b> under stochastic volatility are not known. This paper investigates the valuation of turbo <b>warrants</b> considered by Eriksson (2005), but extends the analysis to the CEV, the fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility and the two time-scale volatility models. We obtain analytical solutions for turbo <b>warrants</b> under the aforementioned models. This enables us to examine the sensitivity of turbo <b>warrants</b> to the implied volatility surface.
