25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> by an innings. We drew the match and I believe this was the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected us to come out of it with our pride intact.|$|E
25|$|During many of {{the battles}} at sea, several {{thousand}} soldiers being transported drowned after their ships <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> was no consensus {{about what to do}} with transported soldiers at sea, and as a result, {{many of the}} ships failed or refused to rescue soldiers that were left shipwrecked. This led to the creation of the second Geneva Convention in 1906, which gave protection and care for shipwrecked soldiers in armed conflict.|$|E
25|$|After the {{two large}} freight ships were {{completed}} the workload <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> were no new orders for new ships or rolling stock. In 1923 the company got two notable projects: {{one of them}} was a minor repair project of a shipwrecked merchant ship. The other one was for completing a semi-finished icebreaker, which had been started at Boecker & Co. shipyard in Tallinn. The Finnish state needed new icebreakers to ensure year-round access to its harbours, and had purchased the hull via John Nurminen company. The icebreaker was named Voima and completed and handed over to the state in 1924. The project was challenging, but the outcome was excellent; it demonstated the company's capability to undertake demanding projects. However, after these projects the company suffered again lack of work. Due to the poor situation, the company had to discontinue the lease contract for the new shipbuilding area and sell the buildings and equipment.|$|E

[...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while we got our picture taken. It's a good thing we did it because when we got the pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E
500|$|Al Williamson {{was born}} in Manhattan, New York City, New York, one of two {{children}} of Sally and Alfonso Williamson, who was of Scottish descent and a Colombian citizen. The family relocated to Bogotá, Colombia, when Al was two years old. [...] "My father was Colombian {{and my mother was}} American," [...] Williamson said in 1997. [...] "They met in the States, got married and <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> I grew up down there so I learned both English and Spanish at the same time. It was comic books that taught me to read both languages." [...] At age nine, Williamson took an interest in comic strips via the Mexican magazine Paquin, which featured American strips as well as Underwater Empire by Argentine cartoonist Carlos Clemen. Later, Williamson was attracted to Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon strip after his mother took him to see the Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe movie serial. While living in Bogotá he met future cartoonist Adolfo Buylla, who befriended him and gave him artistic advice. At age 12, in 1943, Williamson moved with his mother to San Francisco, California; they later moved to New York.|$|E
500|$|Before {{going on}} tour with her Harajuku Lovers Tour (2005), Stefani {{revealed}} {{that she was}} going to release a second album in 2006, stating: [...] "I have a bunch of leftover tracks from making 'Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'. And two months ago, Pharrell called me up, he was like, 'Come down to Miami and write some more songs!' And I'm like, 'OK!' I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and wrote four songs and played three of them tonight. They're really fresh". In September 2006, during the Fashion Week, MTV News interviewed Swizz Beatz and he said to be working with Stefani as well, claiming: [...] "She's always taking it to the next level. I love her background for music. She likes a lot of Caribbean sounds with hard beats". They worked on [...] "Now That You Got It", which was selected to be the fourth single from The Sweet Escape (2006). For the single version, Stefani enlisted Damian Marley, son of Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley, giving the single a [...] "reggae" [...] feel to it. It was released to mainstream radio in the United States, on August 26, 2007, while in the United Kingdom, it was released on October 15, 2007. Two remixes were included on the CD single, both featuring Marley. The [...] "remix" [...] version uses the same instrumentation as the original single, but has a more reggae-infused rendition and an added verse sung by Marley; the [...] "" [...] version features the song's original beat mixed with the remix version.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{meantime}} the two B-17Es had arrived over Menado to find four transports {{out in the}} bay and two more at the docks. On their first run, because of inexperience, they got themselves so blinded by the sun that they could drop no bombs, and on the second one plane had six bombs hang in the racks; yet as they withdrew the crews {{saw one of the}} transports capsize in the bay. Their returning course took them over the airport where the plane with the hung bombs managed to kick out two more on the runways, but the last four remained in the racks. Five minutes after this they were attacked by 15 enemy fighters. Two Messerschmitts, the rest Zeros made their passes from the rear or by diving under the bombers and pulling up behind to deliver their fire. The B-17E Fortress tail gunners, not seen before by the enemy let them come up close. Then, for some minutes before the Japanese discovered what had been added, it beat any skeet shoot ever seen. Five Zeros and one Messerschmidt <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> were wounded in both Fortresses, and they were forced to land at Kendari for medical aid, gas, and repairs. An hour later, while they were still at work on one of the B-17's engines, five Zeros swept in to strafe the field. One of the B-17's took off {{in the face of the}} attacking planes and successfully fought off the three that went after it. The other two Zeros shot up the airport and further damaged the B-17 on the ground. The crew spent two more days endeavoring to repair his engines. Then, with Japanese ground troops approaching the field, they blew up the B-17 ...|$|E
