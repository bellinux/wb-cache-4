40|$|In {{turning of}} {{platinum}} alloy Pt 850, the wear behavior of tools and the cutting characteristics of Pt 850 are investigated experimentally. K 10 carbide, cermet, ceramics and PCD {{are used as}} tool materials. K 10 carbide and cermet are not suitable for the cutting of this material because severe wear on the tool flank was observed after a few second of cutting, that is, {{the width of the}} flank wear land was about 1 mm after 10 seconds cutting. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> of Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4 ceramic tools was small compared with K 10 carbide tool, but the cutting forces increased rapidly as the cutting proceed. PCD tool can be used for cutting of Pt 850 because the width of flank wear land is much small compared with other tool materials used in this experiment and the increasing rate of cutting force is not so great. The influence of cutting speed on the flank wear of PCD tool is small. The surface roughness of work material Pt 850 becomes lower when the smaller feed rate is chosen as a cutting condition and the cutting tool of larger radius corner is used...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of ultra-precision machining, {{the study of the}} {{relation}} between chip morphology and tool wear is significant, since tool wear characteristics can be reflected by morphologies of cutting chips. In this research, the relation between chip morphology and tool flank wear is first investigated in UPRM. A cutting experiment was performed to explore chip morphologies under different <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> flank <b>wear</b> <b>land.</b> A geometric model was developed to identify the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> based on chip morphology. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the occurrence <b>of</b> tool flank <b>wear</b> can make the cutting chips truncated at both their cut-in and cut-out sides, and reduce the length of cutting chips in the feed direction.

40|$|AbstractParticle {{reinforced}} aluminium matrix composites (AMCs) are high-strength {{lightweight materials}} {{consisting of a}} comparatively soft aluminium alloy and hard embedded ceramic particles. The high hardness of the particles results in excellent abrasion resistance. However, this property lends poor machinability involving high tool wear and surface imperfections on the workpieces. For this reason, CVD diamond tipped indexable inserts were used for turning AA 2124 with 25 % volume proportion of SiC particles. The surface integrity {{is influenced by the}} tool geometry, which affects the stress condition in the shear zone. In the research described the influence of modified corner geometries and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> were investigated.

40|$|Surface {{properties}} of components often determine their proper functioning. More complex and increasing demands on operational systems require detailed understanding in {{the influence of}} machining on the surface layer. Besides surface structure, residual stresses are very important, especially for dynamically loaded boundary surfaces. But, for cutting of modern light weight construction materials like aluminium matrix composites there is insufficient information concerning residual stresses. On this account, experimental investigations in turning of SiC particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites with different cutting parameters and tool geometries are presented with the focus on residual stresses. They are determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. The results show that in general the use of very small feeds, tools with a <b>width</b> <b>of</b> flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> about 100 ?m, or with a small corner radius cause high absolute values of the compressive residual stresses. In consequence, knowledge {{of the relation between}} machining and the residual stress state of the surface layer allows to selectively induce residual stresses in the surface layer.

In this paper, a tool-swinging cutting method was applied to reduce the <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> round-nosed diamond tools in cutting of tungsten carbide (WC). In this method, the geometrical center of the cutting edge was adjusted to be in coincidence with the rotation center of the B-axis table, and thus the cutting point could be changed along the cutting edge by swinging the tool about the B-axis center. Experimental results showed that the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the flank <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> was greatly reduced compared to that in the conventional cutting.

40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> tool <b>wear</b> can affect cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality in ultra-precision fly cutting (UPFC), {{there has been}} no research in this area due to the complex cutting mechanism of UPFC. The theoretical and experimental research described in this paper was therefore conducted to explore tool wear characteristics in UPFC and their relationship to cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality. Results from the study reveal that tool wear characteristics in UPFC include cutting edge fractures, workpiece material welding, <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> formation, sub-wear land formation, and micro-grooves. The cutting edge fractures lead to the formation of ridges on both the cutting chips and machined surface; the material welding increases the thrust force, crushes cutting chips, and deteriorates the machined surface quality; and the formation <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> on the cutting edge makes the machined surface burred and fuzzy, and the micro-grooves leave some traces on the machined surface.

DLS measurements indicated the wear particles radius to be in the range from 230 to 260 nm for both materials under applied nominal pressures from 87 to 175 MPa. AFM data revealed the wear particles size to be in the range from 133 to 175 nm. A slight increase in particles size with load was observed by AFM for both materials and confirmed by DLS for steel samples. AFM measurements were taken to determine thickness, length and <b>width</b> distributions <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> particles. The number <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> particles per sliding distance and per unit load was estimated to be in the range from 150 to 750 particlesmmN for steel and approximately 1600 – 1900 particlesmmN for brass...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of experiments in cutting performance and tool <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> a milling cutter in dry side milling of aluminum alloy A 2017. The milling cutter consists of Co-bonded High-Speed-Steel matrix with Diamond-Like-Carbon coating (abbrev. DLC-coated HSS-Co cutter). The machining experiments were carried out with a cutting speed of 63 to 189 [m·min- 1] and feed of 0. 08 [mm/tooth/rev], and the criterion of tool life was the generation of gouges and/or scratches on a machined surface. The experimental results support that the idea that, out of the four types of combination according to {{the presence or absence of}} coating and the up/down cutting manner, the DLC-coated cutter performs well in up-cutting. They also showed that the tool life of a DLC-coated cutter in up-cutting with a cutting speed of 157 [m·min- 1] corresponds to the cutting distance of 80 [m] with average <b>width</b> <b>of</b> flank <b>wear</b> 102 [µm] and that in down-cutting was 60 [m] with 85 [µm]. In the range of cutting distance up to 100 [m], the resultant cutting force with the DLC-coated cutter was smaller than that with a non-coated cutter. In case of the DLC-coated cutter in up-cutting with a cutting speed of 189 [m·min- 1], a chatter vibration occurred during the initial cutting distance. In case of the radial depth of cut of 1. 5 [mm], it lasted up to the cutting distance of 10 [m] and more...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} special {{model for the}} chip forming process based on a simple shear plane cutting model, which determines {{temperature}} distribution on the <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> cutting tools. The propriety of the model is verifed by comparing the calculated temperature with the measured one, which is obtained {{by means of a}} special micro-thermocouple technique. The results obtained are as follows : (1) Moving the shear plane forward and downward from the cutting edge makes it possible {{to take into account the}} distributions of heat sources and velocities in the primary shear zone. (2) The profile of temperatures on the <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> is the same as that on the rake face, while both the maximum temperature and the difference between max. and min. temperatures are lower than those on the rake face. (3) The distribution of frictional tress on　the <b>wear</b> <b>land</b>　is uniform, and the magnitude is nearly half the maximum frictional stress on the rake face. (4) When cutting 0. 46 ％C carbon steel with a worn carbide cutting tool having a <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> length <b>of</b> 0. 6 mm, the Temperature on　the workpiece surface rises 60 K at a cutting speed of 3. 33 m/s. (5) The temperature on the <b>wear</b> <b>land</b> fluctuates by about 200 K when tool vibration occurs...|$|R
