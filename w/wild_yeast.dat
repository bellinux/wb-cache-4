25|$|It is {{virtually}} inevitable that non-Saccharomyces <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> {{will have a}} role in beginning the fermentation of virtually every wine but for the wineries that choose to allow these yeasts to continue fermenting versus minimizing their influence do so with the intent of enhancing complexity through bio-diversity. While these non-Saccharomyces ferment glucose and fructose into alcohol, they also have the potential to create other intermediates that could influence the aroma and flavor profile of the wine. Some of these intermediates could be positive, such as phenylethanol, which can impart a rose-like aroma. However, as with ambient yeasts, the products of these yeasts can be very unpredictable— especially in terms of the types of flavors and aromas that these yeasts can produce.|$|E

50|$|Beers of {{spontaneous}} fermentation use <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> rather than cultivated ones. By the Middle Ages, brewers {{had learned to}} crop the yeast from one brew and use it in the next. Only in a few isolated regions were <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> still used.

2500|$|A wine's quality can {{be judged}} by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total {{aromatic}} experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as cork taint; oxidation due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives; and <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> or bacterial contamination, such as those due to Acetobacter or Brettanomyces yeasts. [...] Although low levels of Brettanomyces aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{winemaking}} {{decisions that}} can {{have a significant effect}} include the temperature of fermentation and what time, if any, that the wine allowed to spend aging on the lees. Burgundian winemaking tends to favor extended contact on the lees and even [...] "stirring up" [...] the lees within the wine while it is aging in the barrel in a process known as bâttonage. Colder fermentation temperatures produces more [...] "tropical" [...] fruit flavors like mango and pineapple. The [...] "Old World" [...] style of winemaking favors the use of wild, or ambient yeast, though some will also use specially cultivated yeast that can impart aromatic qualities to the wine. A particular style of yeast used in Champagne is the Prise de Mousse that is cultivated for use worldwide in sparkling Chardonnay wines. A potential drawback of using <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> is that the fermentation process can go very slow with the results of the yeasts being very unpredictable and producing potentially a very different wine each year. One Burgundian winemaker that favors the use of only <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> is Domaine des Comtes Lafon which had the fermentation of its 1963 Chardonnay batch take 5 years to complete when the fermentation process normally only takes a matter of weeks.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the [...] "ambient" [...] Saccharomyces <b>wild</b> <b>yeast,</b> these genera of {{wild yeasts}} have very low {{tolerance}} to both alcohol and sulfur dioxide. They {{are capable of}} starting a fermentation and often begin this process {{as early as the}} harvest bin when clusters of grapes get slightly crushed under their own weight. Some winemakers will try to [...] "knock out" [...] these yeasts with doses of sulfur dioxide, most often at the crusher before the grapes are pressed or allowed to macerate with skin contact. Other winemakers may allow the wild yeasts to continue fermenting until they succumb to the toxicity of the alcohol they produce which is often between 3–5% alcohol by volume and then letting either inoculated or [...] "ambient" [...] Saccharomyces strains finish the fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, {{winemaking}} {{techniques have}} evolved. The first, primitive [...] "natural wine" [...] or [...] "authentic wine" [...] {{was most likely}} the result of crushed grapes being forgotten while stored in a container. The process of allowing <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> found {{on the surface of}} the grape conduct fermentation in an uncontrolled environment creates a very crude style of wine that may not be palatable to many people. Hence the development of various techniques and practices designed to improve the quality of the wine but which could be viewed as [...] "manipulating" [...] or [...] "adulterating" [...] the wine from its natural or [...] "authentic state". At various points in history, these techniques may be considered too much manipulation, more than what a consumer would likely expect, and thus labeled as [...] "fraud". However as these techniques became more common place in the wine industry, they gained an air of acceptability and eventually became just another tool in the winemaker's tool box to help craft good-quality wine.|$|E
2500|$|In winemaking, {{the term}} [...] "wild yeast" [...] has {{multiple}} meanings. In {{its most basic}} context, it refers to yeast {{that has not been}} introduced to the must by intentional inoculation of a cultured strain. Instead, these [...] "wild yeasts" [...] often come into contact with the must through their presence on harvest equipment, transport bins, the surface winemaking equipment and as part of the natural flora of a winery. Very often these are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have taken residence in these places over the years, sometimes being previously introduced by inoculation of prior vintages. In this context, these wild yeasts are often referred to as ambient, indigenous or natural yeast as opposed to inoculated, selected or cultured yeast. Wineries that often solely rely on these [...] "in-house" [...] strains will sometimes market their wines as being the product of wild or natural fermentations. The (c. 304) Nanfang Caomu Zhuang has the earliest description of winemaking using [...] "herb ferment" [...] (cǎoqū 草麴) <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> with rice and various herbs, including the poisonous Gelsemium elegans (yěgé 冶葛).|$|E

50|$|Historically, meads were {{fermented}} with <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> {{and bacteria}} (as {{noted in the}} recipe quoted above) residing on the skins of the fruit or within the honey itself. <b>Wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> can produce inconsistent results. Yeast companies have isolated strains of yeast which produce consistently appealing products. Brewers, winemakers and mead makers commonly use them for fermentation, including yeast strains identified specifically for mead fermentation. These are strains that have been selected because of their characteristic of preserving delicate honey flavors and aromas.|$|R
25|$|While some rum {{producers}} allow <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> {{to perform}} the fermentation, most use specific strains of yeast to help provide a consistent taste and predictable fermentation time.|$|R
2500|$|While the {{production}} of alcohol is the most noteworthy by-product of yeast metabolism from a winemaking perspective, {{there are a number}} of other products that yeast produce that can be also influence the resulting wine. This includes glycerol which is produced when an intermediate of the glycolysis cycle (dihydroxyacetone) is reduced to [...] "recharge" [...] the NADH enzyme needed to continue other metabolic activities. This is usually produced early in the fermentation process before the mechanisms to reduce acetaldehyde into ethanol to recharge NADH becomes the cell's primary means of maintaining redox balance. As glycerol contributes increased body and a slightly sweet taste without increasing the alcohol level of the wine, some winemakers try to intentionally favor conditions that would promote glycerol production in wine. This includes selecting yeast strains that favor glycerol production (or allowing some <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> like Kloeckera and Metschnikowia to ferment), increased oxygen exposure and aeration as well as fermenting at higher temperatures. Glycerol production is also encouraged if most available acetaldehyde is made unavailable by binding with bisulfite molecules in the wine, but it would take a substantial amount of sulfur dioxide addition (far beyond legal limits) to prolong glycerol production beyond just these very nascent stages of fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} yeast {{associated}} with winemaking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{which has been}} favored due to its predictable and vigorous fermentation capabilities, tolerance of relatively high levels of alcohol and sulfur dioxide {{as well as its}} ability to thrive in normal wine pH between 2.8 and 4. Despite its widespread use which often includes deliberate inoculation from cultured stock, S.cerevisiae is rarely the only yeast species involved in a fermentation. Grapes brought in from harvest are usually teeming with a variety of [...] "wild yeast" [...] from the Kloeckera and Candida genera. These yeasts often begin the fermentation process almost as soon as the grapes are picked when the weight of the clusters in the harvest bins begin to crush the grapes, releasing the sugar-rich must. While additions of sulfur dioxide (often added at the crusher) may limit some of the <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> activities, these yeasts will usually die out once the alcohol level reaches about 15% due to the toxicity of alcohol on the yeast cells physiology while the more alcohol tolerant Saccharomyces species take over. In addition to S. cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus is a species of yeast that can tolerate alcohol levels of 17–20% and is often used in fortified wine production such as ports and varieties such as Zinfandel and Syrah harvested at high Brix sugar levels. Another common yeast involved in wine production is Brettanomyces whose presence in a wine may be viewed by different winemakers as either a wine fault or in limited quantities as an added note of complexity.|$|E
5000|$|At one time, all beers were sour to some degree. As pure yeast {{cultures}} {{were not}} available, the starter used from one batch to another usually contained some <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> and bacteria. Unlike modern brewing, which {{is done in}} a sterile environment to guard against the intrusion of <b>wild</b> <b>yeast,</b> sour beers are made by intentionally allowing <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> strains or bacteria into the brew.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{industrial}} environment, it is well established that in fermentors both bacteria and <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> co-exist with the starter yeast especially selected for the fermentation process. A significant amount of data exists {{with regard to the}} roles assayed by bacteria or <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> alone but the information available on if and how they interact with each other and also with the starter yeast is scanty and has not received the special attention that is warranted. A few published reports that analyse the co-occurrence of Lactobacillus and D. bruxellensis in fermentation processes and evaluate its implications on the ethanol yield can be found in literature (Passoth et al. 2007; Souza et al. 2012; Tiukova et al. 2014). The multitude of interactions possible among bacteria, wild and starter strains of S. cerevisiae remains to be satisfactorily elucidated.|$|R
2500|$|Another use of {{the term}} [...] "wild yeast" [...] refers to the non-Saccharomyces genera of yeasts that are present in the {{vineyard}}, on the surface of grapevines and of the grapes themselves.
