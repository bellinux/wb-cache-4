40|$|Positioning of two drums in the {{rotating}} shaft of <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage</b> is very important because of the deformations and safety, especially when taking into the account the loads during the exploitation. Therefore, in this paper is analysed deflection, slope angle and safety factor of {{the rotating}} shaft depending on {{the position of the}} drum at the optimised <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage.</b> The mathematic model of {{the rotating shaft}} is elaborated in detail, taking into consideration the dimensions after optimization of the <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage.</b> The results for the adopted model, for the dimensions before and after optimization, are satisfactory and present a good starting point for modification {{in the design of the}} <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Winch</b> <b>Haulage</b> is an {{engineering}} system which {{is described by}} set of quantities. The dynamic model of its main shaft is build based on such quantities- {{some of them are}} considered as fixed and called parameters and the other quantities are treated as variables. The behaviour of the shaft’s dynamic model is subjected to stiffness, loading and geometric constraints, while mathematical model calculates strain and stresses, deflection and displacement, etc. For the analysis of the adopted model(s) the Finite Element Method has been used in this paper. FEA methodology was applied at adopted model with ‘real ’ and optimized dimensions. The results that are graphically presented for both cases have been compared bringing to the conclusion that shaft’s adopted model at optimized <b>winch</b> <b>haulage</b> fulfils exploitation criteria and is a good base for the modification of the device...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{optimization}} {{model of the}} main shaft of <b>winch</b> <b>haulage</b> is analysed. The approximate mechanical model {{is built based on}} ‘real ’ shaft taking into consideration the loads and shaft’s behavior in relation to stability and stiffness criteria. The volume of shaft is defined as an objective function subjected to the angle of torsion, safety coefficient, deflection and displacement, and shaft geometry as constraints at optimization model. The phases of design, from building the mechanical model to the evaluation are elaborated from the aspect of decision making, trying to achieve best ‘phase result’. Making a decision for a designer implies the consideration of a number of constraints and criteria during the evaluation of the set of solutions. Therefore, at each phase during optimal design of shaft was considered the decision making methodology that includes four concerns: Task (T), Alternatives (A), Evaluation (E) and Challenge(C). The ‘optimal solution ’ of the adopted model was found with Optimtool of Matlab software. Comparison with ‘real ’ dimensions showed that results are satisfactory and good base for deeper research...|$|E
5000|$|The Huwood Power Loader was {{mechanical}} device of roughly 6ft by 2ft by 1ft dimensions and {{powered by a}} 10hp engine, used to move cut coal from the coal face on to the conveyor. The machine was equipped with <b>winches</b> which used <b>haulage</b> ropes to drag the machine along the coal face and used both horizontal and rotary motions to shift the coal onto the conveyor. Pleasley Colliery, Derbyshire introduced {{one of the first}} such loaders in 1950.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{the quarry}} was {{operated}} by Cookes Explosive, a local firm based at Penrhyndeudraeth, who used its underground chambers to store explosives, mainly propellants. The adit was worked by three Ruston & Hornsby 4-wheeled diesel mechanical locomotives, originally built in 1939 and 1941, and obtained second-hand. Two had been scrapped or sold by 1955, and the date of disposal of the third is unknown. Several buildings were constructed in the marshalling area {{at the far end of}} the adit, and a massive <b>haulage</b> <b>winch</b> partially blocked access to the incline to the levels above. In 1971, the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), operators of the Ffestiniog pumped storage power station, became aware of this use, and calculated that if there was an explosion underground, either of their two dams could be damaged. They therefore drained both reservoirs, and Cookes began removing about 250 tons of explosives per week, which were taken to Penrhyndeudraeth or by rail from Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station to various other ICI Nobel works in the United Kingdom.|$|R
