40|$|Objective. Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) {{resulting in}} low birth weight for gestational age may predispose one to development of cardiovascular disease later in life. Abnormal fetal blood flow {{in the presence of}} fetal growth restriction helps to distinguish infants with true fetal growth impairment from small but normal infants. Our goal was to investigate associations between IUGR with abnormal fetal blood flow and abnormal retinal vascular morphology at 18 years of age. Methods. A prospective study was performed with 21 subjects with IUGR (abnormal fetal aortic blood flow velocity; birth weight small for gestational age; median birth <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> from the population mean of - 31 % [range: - 22 % to - 42 %] and in 23 subjects with birth weight appropriate for gestational age [normal fetal aortic blood flow velocity; median birth <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> of - 2 % (range: - 10 % to 22 %) ]). The retinal vessel morphology was evaluated by digital image analysis. Result. Subjects with IUGR (n = 21) had significantly less retinal vascularization as evidenced by a lower number of vascular branching points (median: 26; range: 20 31) as compared with the subjects who were born appropriate for gestational age (median: 28; range: 26 - 32). Within the entire group (N = 44), increasing negative birth <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> was associated with a reduced number of vascular branching points (r = 0. 36. Conclusion.

40|$|Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) is {{a recognized}} {{risk factor for}} neurologic deficits later in life. Abnormal fetal blood flow {{in the presence of}} fetal growth retardation helps to distinguish true fetal growth impairment from small but normally grown infants. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of IUGR with abnormal fetal blood flow on retinal optic nerve morphology at 18 y of age. A prospective study was performed in 19 subjects with IUGR [abnormal fetal aortic blood flow velocity; median birth <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> of - 31 % (- 22 to - 42 %; median (range) ] and in 23 subjects with a normal birth weight for gestational age [normal fetal aortic blood flow velocity; median birth <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> of - 2 % (- 10 to 22 %) ]. All subjects were previously examined concerning minor neurologic dysfunction (MND) at 7 y of age. The ocular fundus was examined by ophthalmoscopy, and the optic nerve morphology was evaluated by digital image analysis. Decrease in neuroretinal rim area at 18 y of age was associated with increasing negative birth <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> (r = 0. 71, p < 0. 0001). The subjects with severe MND at 7 y had a reduced neuroretinal rim area [median (range), 1. 57 mm(2) (1. 37 - 1. 78 mm(2)) ] compared with those with less severe MND [1. 94 mm(2) (1. 33 - 2. 71 mm(2)) ] and with those with normal neurologic function [2. 18 mm(2) (1. 75 - 2. 70 mm(2)); P < 0. 05 and p < 0. 0001, respectively]. A decrease in neuroretinal rim area reflects either a reduction in axonal volume or a {{decrease in the number of}} axons in the optic nerve.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computer vision system}} for measuring the weight of gobs during a glass forming process, and a control strategy to correct automatically any <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> from a given set-point. During the formation of molten glass gobs, several noise sources can cause a deviation in the weight from a predefined reference value. Among them, there is a random white-noise disturbance caused {{by the lack of}} synchronisation of mechanical devices, the periodic disturbances due to changes in the spinning direction of the tube inside the feeder, and some long-term drifts caused by variations in temperature and viscosity of the raw glass material. The gob weight measurement system developed is based on a monochrome CCD high-resolution camera and photo-detector for synchronising the frame acquisition. The molten glass provides the illumination, so a high contrast image is obtained with a bright object and dark background. Several image-processing algorithms are presented for reliable area estimation. Assuming that the gob is a symmetric geometry of revolution and uniform mass density, the proposed system estimates the weight of gobs with accuracy better than ± 0. 75 %. A learning weight control strategy is proposed based on a PI-repetitive control scheme. The <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> from a set point is used as a control signal to adjust the glass flow into the feeder. This regulation scheme allows effective weight control, cancelling mid and long-term effects. The tracking error, ± 1. 5 %, means a reduction of 40 % when compared with a traditional PI controller...|$|E

Therefore, segregation test could not be suggested with segregation pattern principals as Mendel proposed. Segregation test on BP 542 A showed that it was heterozygote and the resistance was controlled by single gene with complete dominant effect, so the progeny segregated in 75 % resistant and 25 % susceptible. The result of the test showed the absence of maternal effect for root <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> and percentage of necrotic root variables, which meant that no cytoplasmic inheritance was involved.

The new DEA method produces true weights for perfectly consistent pairwise comparison matrices and the best local priorities that are logical and consistent with decision makers (DMs) ' subjective judgments for inconsistent pairwise comparison matrices. In hierarchical structures, the new DEA method utilizes the simple additive weighting (SAW) method for aggregation of the best local priorities without the need of normalization.

METHODS: cross-sectional study, with 433 adult puerperal women (> 20 years old) and their newborns, attending the Maternidade Escola of Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Data was collected through interviews and access to their medical records. Maternal pre-gestational nutritional status was established through pre-gestational body mass index according to the cut-offs for adult women defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), in 1995. The association between gestational outcomes and pre-gestational nutritional status was estimated through odds ratio (OR) and a 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI). RESULTS: frequency of pre-gestational <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> (low weight, overweight and obesity) was 31. 6 %.

40|$|The {{shrinking}} generator is {{a popular}} representation of pseudorandom sequence generators (PRSGs) that employ so-called irregular clocking. This familiy of PRSGs is characterized by having one or more linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), whose clocking {{is controlled by the}} output sequence of one of the subgenerators. Such a sequence is called clock-control sequence. In this thesis, an algorithm is presented that reconstructs the clock-control sequence in the generalized shrinking generator in the presence of noise. The shrinking generator is first reduced to a step 1 -stepE generator (another class of PRSGs with irregular clocking), where E depends on the maximum length of runs of zeros in the output sequence of the clocking part of the generator. Then a directed depth-first like search for optimal and suboptimal paths in the edit distance matrix corresponding to the generator is performed. The permitted path <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> from the optimum is determined by the noise level in the statistical model of the generator. Influence of inadequate estimation of the length of the output sequence of the clocked LFSR without irregular clocking on the level of equivalent noise is discussed. The experimental results that are presented show that the total number of candidate clock-control sequences increases moderately as the necessary clock-control sequence length increases. The advantage of this attack over the other attacks reported in the litterature is that this attack is effective even if the noise level is relatively high and that the solution is guaranteed to be found. ii...|$|E

40|$|CCFE perform Monte-Carlo {{transport}} simulations {{on large}} and complex tokamak models such as ITER. Such simulations are challenging since streaming and deep penetration effects are equally important. In {{order to make}} such simulations tractable, both variance reduction (VR) techniques and parallel computing are used. It {{has been found that}} the application of VR techniques in such models significantly reduces the efficiency of parallel computation due to 'long histories'. VR in MCNP can be accomplished using energy-dependent weight windows. The weight window represents an 'average behaviour' of particles, and large deviations in the arriving weight of a particle give rise to extreme amounts of splitting being performed and a long history. When running on parallel clusters, a long history can have a detrimental effect on the parallel efficiency - if one process is computing the long history, the other CPUs complete their batch of histories and wait idle. Furthermore some long histories {{have been found to be}} effectively intractable. To combat this effect, CCFE has developed an adaptation of MCNP which dynamically adjusts the WW where a large <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> is encountered. The method effectively 'de-optimises' the WW, reducing the VR performance but this is offset by a significant increase in parallel efficiency. Testing with a simple geometry has shown the method does not bias the result. This 'long history method' has enabled CCFE to significantly improve the performance of MCNP calculations for ITER on parallel clusters, and will be beneficial for any geometry combining streaming and deep penetration effects.

Reported {{studies of the}} association between maternal dietary intake of riboflavin and vitamin C, and birth anthropometry show conflicting results {{and it is not}} known whether their intakes influence intrauterine growth. Gender-specific differences in foetal response to nutritional and environmental factors during pregnancy have been suggested. Objectives:To examine whether maternal dietary intake of riboflavin and vitamin C around 17 - 20 weeks of gestation is associated with foetal growth and birth weight, and if the association is gender specific. Design:Prospective cohort study conducted 1986 - 1988 and designed to examine factors related to intrauterine growth. Setting:Routine pregnancy care, special study visits, and University hospital in Bergen and Trondheim with surroundings. Participants: 872 women of Caucasian origin and their second or third singleton offspring. Main outcome measures:Weight deviation (in per cent) from normal weight for the estimated gestational age based on ultrasound measures around 25, 33 and 37 weeks of gestation, and birth weight. Methods: Information on maternal riboflavin and vitamin C intake was obtained from 3 -d dietary records. Before statistical analysisthe intakes were categorized by dividing the frequency distribution into tertiles. Cross-sectional, covariate adjusted multiple linear regression analyses were performed by vitamin and foetal gender. The following covariates were considered: total energy intake, maternalage at study entry, pre-pregnancy body mass index, maternal smoking during pregnancy, highest completed education, previous number of births, and serum ferritin. In addition, for female offspring the analysis regarding maternal riboflavin intake and birth weight was also adjusted for gestational age at delivery. Results: We observed no association between maternalriboflavin intake and estimated foetal <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> during the second or third trimester. Unlike univariate analysis, multivariate analysis showed a borderline significant inverse association between maternal riboflavin intake and birth weight, - 56 g (95...|$|E
40|$|Background : The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of combined training program on C-reactive protein (CRP) serum and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) plasma concentrations in sedentary men. Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, twenty sedentary men (23 ± 2 years) volunteers (with no history of regular exercise program, <b>weight</b> <b>deviation</b> more than 2 kg, special disease and smoking over the past 6 months) to normal Body mass index (BMI) (23 ± 2 kg. m- 2) were chosen randomly in two groups [control (C = 10), training (T = 10) ] and performed combined training [Aerobic exercise: 60 - 70 % of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) for 20 min and resistance exercise: 2 sets of 10 repetitions at 70 % of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) ] 12 -wk (3 d. wk- 1). Results: The results showed that CRP serum levels, waist to hip (W/H), and the body fat percentage in the T group were significantly lower than the C group (P< 0 / 05). But BMI, IL- 6 and body weight did not change in the both groups after the intervention period. Significant correlations in all subjects at baseline were observed between CRP to VO 2 max (P= 0. 035 and r=- 0. 67) and the body fat percentage (P= 0. 018 and r= 0. 72) and also between BMI to body fat percentage (P= 0. 045 and r= 0. 64). Conclusion: It can be said that the performance of combined aerobic-resistance training decreases serum CRP in inactive males. The reduction of serum CRP associated with improvement of body fat percentage. Thus, physical activity should be considered as an integral part of every adult,s lifestyle...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the influence of}} decision makers’ psychological factors on the group decisionprocess, this paper develops {{a new class of}} aggregation operators based on reference-dependentutility functions (RUs) in multi-attribute group decision analysis. We consider two types of RUs:S-shaped, representing decision makers who are risk-seeking for relative losses, and non-S-shaped,representing those that are risk-averse for relative losses. Based on these RUs, we establish twonew classes of reference-dependent aggregation operators; we study their properties and showthat their generality covers a number of existing aggregation operators. To determine the optimalweights for these aggregation operators, we construct an attribute <b>deviation</b> <b>weight</b> model and adecision maker (DM) <b>deviation</b> <b>weight</b> model. Furthermore, we develop a new multi-attribute groupdecision-making (MAGDM) approach based on these RU aggregation operators and weight models. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the application of the approach...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe anticancer drug {{capecitabine}} and its metabolites [including {{the active}} metabolite 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) ] display high pharmacokinetic inter-patient variability. Such variability, which {{may lead to}} treatment failure or toxicity, could need drug concentration measurement to individualize dosing regimen. However, usual assay methods are often long and fastidious. A simultaneous and cost-effective method was thus developed for {{the determination of the}} concentrations of these compounds in human plasma. Compounds were extracted via a classic liquid-liquid extraction. Chromatographic analysis was performed on a C 18 reverse phase column with detection by atmosphere pressure chemical ionization LC-MS/MS. Our method allows a good chromatographic separation of the compounds and was fully validated following Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations (good selectivity, no carry-over, linearity of the calibration curves without <b>weighting,</b> <b>deviations</b> from nominal concentrations of standard samples lower than 15 %, intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy lower than 15 %). Recovery and stability were also acceptable following the FDA guidelines. A matrix effect impairing the determination of 5 -FU was avoided by using a stable isotopic derivative of 5 -FU as internal standard. Interestingly, this method allows detection of TetraHydroUridine, an inhibitor of ex vivo degradation of metabolites, which is essential for the stability, the adequate conditioning of blood samples and for good laboratory practice, essential in routine determination. This method seems usable to routinely determine concentrations of capecitabine and its metabolites in blood and may be helpful in further studies aiming at performing therapeutic drug monitoring...|$|R
