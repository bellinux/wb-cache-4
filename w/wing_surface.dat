5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E

5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E
5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

50|$|Austria-Hungary {{produced}} 413 seaplanes {{during the}} war. These naval aircraft were more elaborately marked.

Additionally, the rudder and elevators were blocked out in red and white; broad red and white bands were sometimes applied to the outboard ends of the wings also.

25|$|Early in 1923, a {{decision}} was made to redesign the racer and in the months following, a completely new design emerged with the original landplane being converted into a floatplane. Radical surgery was performed to turn the sesquiplane into a biplane, with strutted wings, <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> radiators, enlarged tail surfaces and a set of floats also part of the redesign. Fitted with a new, more powerful 700hp Wright T-3, a development of the T-2 and a three-blade propeller, the second of the NW series was designated NW-2 and was entered into the 1923 Schneider Trophy held at Cowes, Isle of Wight.|$|E
25|$|Droops {{function}} with other high-lift devices on an aircraft {{to increase the}} camber of the wing and reduce the stalling speed. On the Airbus A380, {{the first stage of}} lift device selection deploys the droops (called droop noses by Airbus) and leading-edge slats located further out on the wing; with the flaps starting to extend when the second stage is selected. The droops on the A380 may be deployed to a position 22 or 25 degrees lower than their stowed position. Another function of the droops on the A380 is to change the stall characteristics of the wing. The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding a droop between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.|$|E
25|$|The hull was a two-step design {{using the}} Linton Hope {{construction}} method. This used {{a system of}} circular formers separated by stringers {{and covered with a}} double layer of 0.125in (3.2mm) mahogany strips, the second at right angles to the first. This allowed the construction of smooth curved surfaces. The Pellet was a single-bay biplane without stagger and was often described as a sesquiplane because the lower wing was not only of smaller span but also of smaller chord. The lower wing was mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage and carried wingtip floats mounted directly below the N-type interplane struts. There was another pair of these struts between the fuselage and upper wing supporting the engine, which was mounted tractorwise above the upper <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> in a streamlined nacelle. The engine, a 450hp (340kW) Napier Lion was cooled with radiators fitted flush in the lower surface of the upper wing. The pilot sat in front of the propeller. At the rear of the aircraft, the braced tailplane was mounted about halfway up the single fin.|$|E

The females' dorsal <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> are a drab brown, with small yellowish white spots. Both sexes have drab ventral wings, presumably as a means of camouflage. The dramatic colours of the males are thought {{to play a role in}} intraspecies communication, both by signalling to other males when defending territory, and by attracting females.|$|R
25|$|Like other maniraptorans, Anchiornis had a propatagium, a flap of skin {{connecting}} the wrist {{to the shoulder}} and rounding out {{the front edge of}} the wing. In Anchiornis, this part of the wing was covered in covert feathers which smoothed the wing and covered the gaps between the larger primary and secondary feathers. However, unlike modern birds, the covert feathers of Anchiornis were not arranged in tracts or rows. The arrangement of the covert feathers was also more primitive in Anchiornis than in birds and more advanced paravians. In modern birds, the coverts usually cover only the upper portion of the wing, with most of the <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> made up of uncovered flight feathers. In some Anchiornis fossils, on the other hand, several layers of covert feathers seem to extend down to cover most of the wing's surface, so that the wing is essentially made of multiple layers of feathers, rather than a layer of broad feathers with only their bases hidden by layers of coverts. This multi-layered wing arrangement might have helped strengthen the wing, considering that the primary and secondary feathers themselves were narrow and weak.|$|E
25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E
25|$|The XP-82 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Packard-built Rolls-Royce V-1650 Merlin engines. Initially, the left engine was a V-1650-23 with a gear {{reduction}} box to allow the left propeller to turn opposite to the right propeller, which was driven by the more conventional V-1650-25. In this arrangement both propellers would turn upward {{as they approached the}} center wing, which in theory would have allowed better single-engine control. This proved not to be the case when the aircraft refused to become airborne during its first flight attempt. After a month of work North American engineers finally discovered that rotating the propellers to meet in the center on their upward turn created sufficient drag to cancel out all lift from the center wing section, one quarter of the aircraft's total <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> area. The engines and propellers were then exchanged, with their rotation meeting on the downward turn, and the problem was fully solved. The first XP-82 prototype (44-83886) was completed on 25 May 1945, and made the type's first successful flight on 26 June 1945. This aircraft was accepted by the Army Air Forces on 30 August 1945, whose officials were so impressed by the aircraft, while still in development, that they ordered the first production P-82Bs in March 1945, fully three months before its first flight.|$|E

25|$|It was {{originally}} thought that Microraptor was a glider, and probably lived mainly in trees, because the hindwings {{anchored to the}} feet of Microraptor would have hindered their ability to run on the ground. Some paleontologists have suggested that feathered dinosaurs used their wings to parachute from trees, possibly to attack or ambush prey on the ground, as a precursor to gliding or true flight. In their 2007 study, Chatterjee and Templin tested this hypothesis as well, {{and found that the}} combined <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> of Microraptor was too narrow to successfully parachute to the ground without injury from any significant height. However, the authors did leave open the possibility that Microraptor could have parachuted short distances, as between closely spaced tree branches. Wind tunnel experiments have demonstrated that sustaining a high-lift coefficient at the expense of high drag was likely the most efficient strategy for Microraptor when gliding between low elevations. Microraptor did not require a sophisticated, ‘modern’ wing morphology to be an effective glider. However, the idea that Microraptor was an arboreal glider relies on it to have regularly climbed or even lived in trees, when study of its anatomy have shown that its limb proportions fall in line with modern ground birds rather than climbers, and its skeleton shows none of the expected adaptations in animals specialized for climbing trees.|$|E
25|$|In September 1942, the G-4 appeared; {{this version}} was {{identical}} to the G-2 in all respects, including performance, except for being fitted with the FuG 16 VHF radio set, which provided much clearer radio transmissions and had three-times {{the range of the}} earlier HF sets. Externally this could be recognised by the position of the fuselage antenna lead-in which was moved further aft to between frames seven and eight on the fuselage spine. Due to the steady weight increases of the 109, from the spring of 1943 larger 660×160mm (26×6.3in) mainwheels were introduced, replacing the previously used 650×150mm (25.6×6in) type. The undercarriage legs were altered so that the wheel's vertical axis was nearly upright rather than being parallel with the oleo leg. These changes resulted in the fitting of teardrop-shaped fairings to the upper <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> above the wheel-wells to accommodate {{the upper part of the}} mainwheels. The larger wheels and fairings were often retrofitted to G-2s. In addition, a larger 350×135mm (14×5in) tailwheel replaced the original 290×110mm (11×4in) one; the larger tailwheel no longer fitted the recess, so the retraction mechanism was disconnected and the tailwheel fixed down. Up to July 1943, 1,242 G-4s were produced, with an additional four in Győr and WNF factories in the second half of 1943. Between January and February 1943, 50 examples of a pressurized version, the G-3 were also produced; similar to the G-1 although it was equipped with the same FuG 16 VHF radio set as the G-4.|$|E

40|$|Integrins are {{evolutionarily}} conserved transmembrane α,β heterodimeric receptors {{involved in}} cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell adhesions.

In Drosophila, somatic clones of mutations in PS integrin genes disrupt adhesion between <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> to produce <b>wing</b> blisters.

Chromosomal sites were determined by deficiency mapping, and genetic interactions with mutations in the β(PS) integrin gene myospheroid were investigated. Mutations in four known genes (blistered, Delta, dumpy and mastermind) were isolated. Mutations were isolated in three new genes (piopio, rhea and steamer duck) that affect myo-epidermal junctions or muscle function in embryos. Mutations in three other genes (kakapo, kiwi and moa) may also affect cell adhesion or muscle function at hatching.

50|$|The latter occurs for a {{broad range}} of {{incident}} wavelengths, covering the whole visible spectrum, and of incidence angles. This broadband and omnidirectional anti-reflection property originates from nanopillars standing on the <b>wing's</b> <b>surface</b> which ensures a gradient of refractive index between the incident medium (air) and the wing's membrane. Those nanopillars, non-periodically arranged on the <b>wing's</b> <b>surface,</b> possess a high aspect ratio (height divided by radius) in excess of 6, where the radii are below the wavelengths of the visible light. Besides, they feature a random height and width distribution, which is directly responsible for the smooth refractive index gradient and thereby for the broadband and omnidirectional anti-reflection properties. These properties are further improved by the presence of pedestals {{at the base of the}} nanopillars.|$|R
