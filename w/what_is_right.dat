5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same}} time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E
5|$|Every {{member of}} this family does exactly {{what he or she}} wants to do. Each one is his or her supreme court. Everything for the common good of the family is decided {{according}} to the wishes of the whole family. Each one knows <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and each one can do whatever he thinks is best. It is purely democratic.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E

'Ha, ha!' laughed Mr. Peggotty, {{sitting down}} beside us, and rubbing {{his hands in}} his sense of relief from recent trouble, and in the genuine heartiness of his nature; 'there's not a woman in the wureld, sir--as I tell her--that need to feel more easy in her mind than her! She done her dooty by the {{departed}}, and the departed know'd it; and the departed done <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> by her, as she done <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> by the departed;--and--and--and it's all right!' ...|$|R
5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna to do <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as {{she picks up a}} knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E

The real Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus was a Roman general and politician who was as ambitious as Caesar and just as unorthodox in his youth. He chose to ally himself with the optimates in opposing Caesar and supporting the traditional Roman Republic.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{people began}} to think that they were too busy to heed every crime and abuse that {{happened}} in their society. They grieved on the rising of evil amongst their people. But most of their time had already been invested in tending their fief. So, they appointed someone to rectify <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and what is wrong, give warnings to those who need it, give punishment to those who deserve it, and in return, they will give him a share of their rice.|$|E

25|$|Interventions {{in primary}} schools were started during the '80s, {{with the basic}} {{objective}} of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told {{that they can have}} their own feelings about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.|$|E

25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E
25|$|In 839 Jang proved {{instrumental}} in the seizure of power by Silla's King Sinmu following the overthrow of King Minae. Kim Ujing (later King Sinmu) approached Jang for help in taking the throne from the usurper who had killed Ujing‘s father. Jang is purported to have replied, “The ancients had a saying, ‘To see <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and {{not to do it}} is want of courage.’ Though I am without ability, I shall follow your orders.” Thereupon Jang dispatched a force of 5000 men under the command of his closest companion and adviser Jeong Yeon (who had since also returned from Tang) in support of Sinmu's claim. The success of Sinmu's power grab won Jang Bogo the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the word}} of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying that God had made a {{covenant}} with the Israelites' forefathers when God brought them out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage that in the seventh year they must let every Hebrew slave go free, but their forefathers did not listen. The people had turned and done <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> in God's eyes, proclaiming liberty to their neighbors, making a covenant before God in the Temple. But the people turned again and profaned God's name, causing their servants whom they had freed to return to subjugation as servants once again. Therefore, God said that as the people had not listened to God to proclaim liberty to their neighbors, God would proclaim for the people liberty to the sword, pestilence, and famine, and would make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. God would give over to their enemies the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the officers, the priests, and all the people of the land who had transgressed God's covenant, who had sealed the covenant by cutting a calf in half and passing between the two parts of the calf, and their dead bodies would be food for scavengers. And God would give Zedekiah and his princes into the hand of the king of Babylon, who would return to burn Jerusalem and lay desolate the cities of Judah.|$|E
