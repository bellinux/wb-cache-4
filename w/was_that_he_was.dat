5|$|In 1914, Billy Butlin {{was living}} in Toronto {{with his mother and}} stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons {{department}} store. According to Butlin, one of the best aspects of working for the company <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to visit their summer camp which gave him his first taste of a real holidayindeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the subject}} of a 60 Minutes segment, in which Jacobson told Mike Wallace, after pausing for several seconds and looking downward, that he broke down and ordered Boys Who Love Boys because he wanted to see just what it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being so heavily {{solicited}} to buy. A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E
50|$|Three main {{theories}} exist {{about what}} happened: One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got lost and perished somehow, likely {{during the first}} night. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attacked by a hungry bear and carried off. The last <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> abducted and {{taken out of the}} park by a human. His father is a proponent of the third theory.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} Stephen Northup are unknown. Published sources are silent {{as to his}} provenance, but online sources have offered two possibilities. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in 1633 {{as the son of}} Hampton Northup of Flintshire, Wales. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in 1625, the son of Henry Northup of Whaddon, Cambridgeshire, England.|$|R

5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and that Williams had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided to bury the gun {{on the beach and}} send a letter to Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in love with Seymour.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too trusting, {{to the point of}} naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|Apollo tells Veronica that he {{actually}} does want the paternity test. Dick’s father, {{who was involved in}} a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E

5|$|In March 1999, Dick Clark Productions {{announced}} their teaming with Dodd Darin on a biopic, with collaboration from producer Arthur Friedman, {{who had been}} developing both The Bobby Darin Story and Dreamer with Levinson at Warner Bros. since 1986. Shortly afterwards, Spacey was in discussions with Dodd Darin to star in the lead role. Spacey was able to acquire the film rights from Warner Bros. in early 2000. With the help of Dodd Darin, the actor also received exclusive music rights for no charge. With his Academy Award-winning performance in American Beauty (1999), Paramount Pictures became interested in distributing/financing Beyond the Sea. The deal fell apart when Paramount told Spacey <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too old for the role and instead wanted Leonardo DiCaprio. Beginning in October 2000, Spacey took vocal training lessons from Darin collaborator Roger Kellaway to give an accurate portrayal of the singer.|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Butlin {{recorded}} {{that his}} mother remarried and emigrated to Canada around 1910 and passenger lists of the period show Bertha travelling to Toronto via Montreal in 1912. For two years Butlin, and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol. In December 1913 his mother returned and married Charles Robotham in Swindon. Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life. Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, while studying at night school twice a week.|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> shortsighted and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E

50|$|Harold Poole holds two Mr. Olympia distinctions. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the {{youngest}} ever competitor to {{have participated in}} the Olympia. In 1965 he competed in the first Mr. Olympia at the age of 21. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the only man to compete in all three of the initial Mr. Olympia contests. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> runner-up in the 1965 and 1966 shows.|$|R

5|$|Peckham laid {{stress on}} discipline, which often {{resulted}} {{in conflict with}} his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham's specifying that a copy of Magna Carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as an unnecessary intrusion into political affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence was if the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal policies or power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. One reason the archbishop may have backed down <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|The lead-up to {{the match}} was controversial. The All Blacks' manager George Dixon and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) {{could not agree}} on a referee. Dixon {{rejected}} all of the WRU's proposed referees, and the WRU all of Dixon's. The rules of the day dictated that {{in such a case}} the WRU could ask another union to appoint a referee. They asked the Scotland Rugby Union, who appointed Scotsman John Dallas. As well as the referee, the selection of Mynott at first five-eighth over Billy Stead was highly controversial. Several explanations were given for Stead's omission. One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> originally selected, but gave up his spot in the team for a disappointed Mynott. The official reason given for Stead's omission was injury—although he was fit enough to act as touch judge during the Test.|$|E

5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} him <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> killed while attempting a rescue; however, this is untrue. Barry retired to Bern, Switzerland {{and after his}} death his body was passed into {{the care of the}} Natural History Museum of Bern. His skin has been preserved through taxidermy although his skull was modified in 1923 to match the Saint Bernard of that time period. His story and name have been used in literary works, and a monument to him stands in the Cimetière des Chiens near Paris. At the hospice one dog has always been named Barry in his honor and since 2004 the Foundation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard has been set up to take over the responsibility for breeding dogs from the hospice.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's {{network of}} monasteries {{extended}} across {{at least three}} of the kingdoms of England in his day. They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle, as well as possibly Peterborough, Brixworth, Evesham, Wing, and Withington. At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin to that of the continent and Rome, travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120followers. He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for fostering, and Wilfrid was known to help his protégés, no matter if they became clerics or not. The historian Peter Brown speculated that one reason for Wilfrid's exile in 678 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> overshadowing the king as a patron. His contacts extended to the Lombard kingdom in Italy, where they included King Perctarit and his son Cunipert.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 9th century, England was almost completely {{under the control of the}} Anglo-Saxons, with Mercia and Wessex the most important southern kingdoms. Mercia was dominant until the 820s, and it exercised overlordship over East Anglia and Kent, but Wessex was able to maintain its independence from its more powerful neighbour. Offa, King of Mercia from 757 to 796, was the dominant figure of the second half of the 8th century. King Beorhtric of Wessex (786–802), married Offa's daughter in 789. Beorhtric and Offa drove Æthelwulf's father Egbert into exile, and he spent several years at the court of Charlemagne in Francia. Egbert was the son of Ealhmund, who had briefly been King of Kent in 784. Following Offa's death, King Coenwulf of Mercia (796–821) maintained Mercian dominance, but it is uncertain whether Beorhtric ever accepted political subordination, and when he died in 802 Egbert became king, perhaps with the support of Charlemagne. For two hundred years three kindreds had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Egbert's best claim <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King Ine (688–726), and in 802 it would have seemed very unlikely that he would establish a lasting dynasty.|$|E
