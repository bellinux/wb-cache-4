The device, known as the wrist alignment device (WAD), consists of flexible electrogoniometers attached to a LycraH glove and a control box housing the WAD circuitry.

Additionally, the device consists of a <b>window</b> <b>comparator,</b> which allows the joint movement always to remain within the set limits.

The ABCD 3 T[1] features a 128 -channel analog front-end, a digital pipeline, and communication circuitry, clocked at 40 MHz, which is the bunch crossing frequency at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The tester measures values and tolerance ranges of all critical IC parameters, including DC parameters, electronic noise, time resolution, clock levels and clock timing.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 77) An apparatus {{for processing}} of electrophysiological signals {{has been designed}} and built. It has advantages over similar existing devices {{in that it is}} frequency independent over the range of electrophysiological signals, is simple to use, and inexpensive. The instrument is versatile, since it is capable of threshold detection, amplitude discrimination, frequency and interval analysis, and also determination if the frequency or interval of the examined signal falls within, above, or below a predetermined band. The design is based on the method of threshold detection of analog signals. Incoming signals are detected in a voltage <b>window</b> <b>comparator</b> with two adjustable threshold levels and converted into digital pulses. Further signal processing is then performed digitally by CMOS logic circuitry. The outputs of the apparatus are available in a form of an analog voltage for interfacing with analog devices and pen writing instruments and also {{in the form of a}} 12 bit digital word for interfacing with digital equipment and computers for further data processing. A digital readout display is also provided. The design is modular and each of the building blocks can be used separately to perform a specific task. As a demonstration of the feasibility of the instrument for actual physiological data processing, preliminary data on heart rates during and after exercise and on pacemaker firing rates in cardiac patients are compiled here, and examples for further use in electrophysiology and medicine are suggested...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two ways}} in which the testing may be initiated, {{remotely}} or locally. If the remote operation is desired, an external TTL level signal must be provided to the test jig with the remotellocal switch {{on the side of the}} test jig switched to remote. A logic high will initiate the test. A logic low will terminate the test. In the event that an external signal is connected to the test jig while local operation occurs, the local control takes precedence over remote control. Once a DVT has been locked in the ZIF socket and the DIP switches are selected, the Push-to-Test button may be depressed. Momentarily depressing the button will initiate a test with a minimum 400 ms duration. At the same time a PBCLOCK and PBLATCH pulses will be initiated and the power rails + 12 V, + 8 V, and - 6 V will be ramped to full voltage. The time at which the power rails reach the full voltage is about 13 ms and it is synchronized with bypass capacitors placed on COMP input of U 20 and U 22 and on the output of U 23 voltage regulators. The voltage rails are supplied to a {+-} 10 % <b>window</b> <b>comparator.</b> A red LED indicates the rail is below or above 10 % of the design value. A green LED indicates the rail is within acceptable limits. For DDT with a 5 pF and 10 pF feed back capacitor, the + 12 V and + 8 V rails are current-regulated to 19 rnA and 22 rnA respectively and the - 6 V rail is short-circuit protected within the regulator. For DUT with a 22 pF feed back capacitor the current regulation is the same as above except that the + 8 V rail is current regulated to 43 rnA. The power rails are supplied to the DUT via a 10 {Omega} resistor. The voltage drop across this resistor is sensed by a differential amplifier AD 620 and amplified by a gain of 10. An external BNC connection is provided from this point to allow for current measurements by the vendor. The current value for each rail is calculated by measuring the voltage value at this point and divided by (10 * 10 {Omega}). The next stage inverts and amplifies the voltage signal by a factor of 5 for + 12 V and - 6 V rails and by a factor of 1 for + 8 V rail. For DUT with 22 pF feed back capacitor the amplification factors are same as above except that the amplification factor for + 8 V rail is a gain of 2. An offset null potentiometer is provided between the AD 620 and the inverting stage which eliminates device offset current errors. The inverted and amplified voltage is presented to two window comparators. One of them compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the low threshold point and the other one compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the high threshold point. If the inverted and amplified voltage is within the low and high threshold points, both the low and the high current LEDs illuminate green indicating the current is within acceptable limits. If the inverted and amplified voltage is below the low threshold point or above the high threshold point, the low current LED or the high current LED illuminates red, respectively, indicating the current is outside acceptable limits...|$|E
