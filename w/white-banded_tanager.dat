40|$|Population {{viability}} {{analyses are}} widely used to support decisions {{for the management of}} single species, but there are few studies that explicitly take into account realistic economic costs. In this study we determine the most cost-efficient conservation management options for the <b>white-banded</b> <b>tanager</b> (Neothraupis fasciata) in the protected areas of the Cerrado in central Brazil. We use the PVA model VORTEX to simulate the ability of different management options to improve population persistence and then assess the effectiveness of each option given a fixed budget. We discover that the best strategy for improving the viability of <b>white-banded</b> <b>tanager</b> populations is to use fire management and nest protection to increase fecundity. in small reserves and a low budget then fire management alone is the best strategy, but if the budget is larger fire management with nest protection as a mixed strategy is better. In large reserves the best strategy is to do nest protection and with large budgets there is a negligible difference between spending all the money on nest protection versus a mixed strategy. if we had not included financial considerations in our analysis of management options then we would have discarded fire management as an option, even though it can be the best strategy.

40|$|The {{pressures}} for land use change {{have led to}} an increasing isolation of habitat remnants throughout the world. The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate the population size and density of some endemic and threatened species in a nature reserve in the Cerrado biome. One hundred and thirty four point transects were undertaken at the Estacao Ecologica de Itirapina (EEI), one of the last natural grassland savannah remnants in Sao Paulo state, in the south-east of Brazil between September and December 2006 and densities estimated for seven species (four endemic to the Cerrado, one near-endemic and two grassland specialists). Neither species reached the minimum viable population size of 500 - 5000 individuals. Four species, <b>White-banded</b> <b>Tanager,</b> White-rumped Tanager, Black-throated Saltator and Sharp-tailed Tyrant have populations ranging from 112 to 248 individuals, while the other species have a low population (< 60 individuals). The mean densities of Sharp-tailed Tyrant and Cock-tailed Tyrant in the EEI grassland showed similar values to those observed in larger areas of the Cerrado, which may indicate that the EEL grassland area is well conserved. In spite of the restricted size of the EEI, small areas can maintain some endemic and threatened bird populations, thus contributing to local biodiversity and the ecological processes in the region. The capacity of fragments of Cerrado (similar to 2, 000 ha) to maintain populations of endemic and threatened bird species is unlikely to be effective in the long term.
