500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E
2500|$|The {{increasing}} {{usage of}} [...] "Happy Holidays" [...] {{has been the}} subject of some controversy in the United States.

Ahmad Yani, {{a member of the}} minority Islamic United Development Party said that [...] "Corby deserves the death penalty" [...] and [...] "We lose 50 children to drugs every day." [...] A 2014 editorial in Media Indonesia said that [...] "Corby's freeing is highly offensive to society's sense of justice" [...] and the Metro TV channel said [...] "Is not that the same as rewarding an enemy who has killed our children?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Helms-Burton Act {{has been}} the target of {{criticism}} from Canadian and European governments in particular, who object to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> the extraterritorial pretensions of a piece of legislation aimed at punishing non-U.S. corporations and non-U.S. investors who have economic interests in Cuba. In the Canadian House of Commons, Helms-Burton was mocked by the introduction of the Godfrey-Milliken Bill, which called for the return of property of United Empire Loyalists seized by the American government {{as a result of the}} American Revolution (the bill never became law).

Other opponents assert that some kind of ill-defined [...] "consensus argument" [...] is being used, and then dismiss this by arguing that science is based on facts rather than consensus. Some highlight the dangers of focusing on only one viewpoint in the context of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> unsettled science, or point out that science is based on facts and not on opinion polls or consensus.|$|E

60|$|It is {{here that}} those who explain this modern religiosity will seem most {{arbitrary}} to the inquirer. For they relate of God, as men will relate of a close friend, his dispositions, his apparent intentions, the aims of his kingship. And just as they advance no proof whatever {{of the existence of}} God but their realisation of him, so with regard to these qualities and dispositions they have little argument but profound conviction. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> this; that if you do not feel God then there is no persuading you of him; we cannot win over the incredulous. And what they say of his qualities is this; that if you feel God then you will know, you will realise more and more clearly, that thus and thus and no other is his method and intention.|$|E
6000|$|It is painful--it is even humiliating--but I am reduced {{at last to}} one slender theory: {{that the}} oysters climbed up there of their own accord. But what object could they have had in view?--what did they want up there? What could any oyster want to climb a hill for? To climb a hill must {{necessarily}} be fatiguing and annoying exercise for an oyster. The most natural conclusion {{would be that the}} oysters climbed up there to look at the scenery. Yet when one comes to reflect upon the nature of an oyster, it seems plain that he does not care for scenery. An oyster has no taste for such things; he cares nothing for the beautiful. An oyster is of a retiring disposition, and not lively--not even cheerful above the average, and never enterprising. But above all, an oyster does not take any interest in scenery--he scorns it. What have I arrived at now? Simply at the point I started from, namely, those oyster shells are there, in regular layers, five hundred feet above the sea, and no man knows how they got there. I have hunted up the guide-books, and the gist of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> this: [...] "They are there, but how they got there is a mystery." ...|$|E

Still I thought I would let you know that the story is going about, so that you might not be taken aback if you heard it suddenly. Of course, it's no disgrace to be tried for murder if you are found innocent; it only shows that some fools have made a mistake, and been proved to be wrong. Still, as it has been talked about, you ought to know it. There is a lot of feeling in the regiment about it now, and the fellow who told the story has had a rough time of it, and there's many a one would put a bullet into him if he had the chance. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> whether you are Captain Mervyn or not is nothing to anybody but yourself.
