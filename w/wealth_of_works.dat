He {{was one of his}} time’s foremost minds. Besides his mother tongue (German), Müller mastered the ancient tongues of Latin, Greek and Hebrew as well as French and a few Oriental languages. Besides theology, his favourite scientiﬁc ﬁelds were mathematics, astronomy and botany. His library held a <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> - 2,580 volumes - with some works dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, among them four incunables.

50|$|The impulse for the {{founding}} of the monastery by Queen Margaret, and sometimes the nuns are called las Margaritas, was to celebrate her husband's expulsion of the Moriscos, resident Moors. The queen had the prioress of the monastery of discalced nuns of San Agustín in Valladolid, Mother Mariana de San José, accompanied by Francisca de San Ambrosio (sister of the marquesa de Pozas), Catalina de la Encarnación, and Isabel de la Cruz. First lodged in the Convent of Santa Isabel while they awaited the completion, they received donations from the king and queen, including jewels, to finance the monastery. The monastery was built adjacent to the then extant Real Alcázar, and had a passageway to allow the royals direct access. The monastery was inaugurated in the 2nd of July 1616, a few years after the queen had died.The architect and friar Alberto de la Madre de Dios designed and built the monastery between 1611-1616. The facade has a sobriety recalling the style of Juan de Herrera. The monastery, now partly a museum, has a <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> of art and relics including tubes with the blood of St. Januarius and of St. Pantaleon.|$|E

40|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, the principles of thermodynamics were summarized into the so-called four laws, which were, as it turns out, definitive negative answers to the doomed quests for perpetual motion machines. As a matter of fact, one result of Sadi Carnot's work was precisely that the heat-to-work conversion process is fundamentally limited; as such, it is considered as a first version of the second law of thermodynamics. Although it was derived from Carnot's unrealistic model, the upper bound on the thermodynamic conversion efficiency, known as the Carnot efficiency, became a paradigm as the next target after the failure of the perpetual motion ideal. In the 1950 's, Jacques Yvon published a conference paper containing the necessary ingredients for a new class of models, and even a formula, not so different from that of Carnot's efficiency, which later would become the new efficiency reference. Yvon's first analysis [ [...] . ] went fairly unnoticed for twenty years, until Frank Curzon and Boye Ahlborn published their pedagogical paper about the effect of finite heat transfer on output power limitation and their derivation of the efficiency at maximum power, now known as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) efficiency. The notion of finite rate explicitly introduced time in thermodynamics, and its significance cannot be overlooked as shown by the <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> devoted to what is now known as finite-time thermodynamics {{since the end of the}} 1970 's. [ [...] . ] The object of the article is thus to cover some of the milestones of thermodynamics, and show through the illustrative case of thermoelectric generators, our model heat engine, that the shift from Carnot's efficiency to efficiencies at maximum power explains itself naturally as one considers continuity and boundary conditions carefully [ [...] . ]...|$|E

As such, mapping plays a significant role in this process. The field of Ontology Mapping presents a <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the information mapping domain which we propose to exploit by applying it to Information Visualization for the Semantic Web. In this paper we describe a User Interface and a tool (VizThis) which demonstrates the proposed approach. We discuss the benefits which a mapping paradigm brings to Information Visualization, including automaticity and rule constraint. The system facilitates automatic mapping while still allowing users the ability to tweak the chosen mappings in order to improve the cognitive value of the visualizations. Additionally, the mapping choices available are constrained by rules governed by the characteristics of both the source and target format. A worked example is provided together with the results of a qualitative user evaluation of the resulting visualizations. ...|$|R

The paper argues that these two activities are absolutely essential to understanding the relationship between culture and social inequality, but that the two activities have traditionally been considered separately in both academic research and public policy, despite the importance of culture to British and thus international policy agendas. The article uses the example of higher education in the UK to think through the relationship between cultural consumption and production.
