5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it.

A different version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E
