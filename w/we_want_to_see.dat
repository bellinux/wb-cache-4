25|$|In part two, Unger {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the self as transcending all of the fixed social world.|$|E

Colin Covert of Colorado Springs' The Gazette considered Bell's performance as a [...] "flawless delivery". Matt Goldberg extolled the relationship between Anna and her elder sister Elsa, writing, [...] "There's so much to love about Frozen, but {{at the top of}} the list is the emphasis on [...] and Elsa's relationship.

[...] Magdalena Lachowicz of The Heights referred to this sisterly bond as [...] "what truly makes the film and the moral that comes with it", commenting, [...] "the plot is set up to lead the viewer into thinking that it needs to be true love's kiss—something which Anna then goes to seek. This journey sends her on a difficult adventure in which she learns about both sacrifice and love." [...] Debbie Lynn Elias of Culver City Observer commented, [...] "Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love," [...] while Stephen Holden from The New York Times appreciated that instead of a romantic attachment, it was a sisterly love and devotion that drove the story, which departed greatly from traditional Disney formula.

At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty.

[...] She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, {{and the rule of law}} in order to be effective – in the end [...] "free people govern themselves best". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters [...] "is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> reform."

[...] As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, [...] "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so." ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{our research}} into {{the creation of a}} new concurrency visualization called Beat. Our research began with the observation that software used to create and record music has been incredibly successful and that there were broad similarities between these pieces of software and existing concurrent visualizations. This led us to question if there were reasons why music software had been successful, why concurrent visualizations hadn't been as comparatively successful and nally if this could teach us anything about building better visualizations. The existing literature was examined to learn more about concurrency, visualization and music software and notations. For concurrency <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what existing solutions to the problems of concurrency exist and in particular existing solutions to concurrent debugging. With existing visualizations <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if there was anything we could identify about them that made them ine ective for solving the problems of concurrency. Conversely <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>we</b> could identify what made music software and notations so e ective for solving problems for musicians. The examination of the existing literature led to the design and implementation of the Beat software, based on the ideas we had discovered in our search of the literature. To test how e ective the design and software was we conducted an evaluation with programmers, which validated many of the decisions we had made and gave us a number of future directions to take with our research. The main contribution of this thesis is a new approach to designing concurrency visualizations that emphasizes using the low level details of program execution and integrates execution data into a single view to help with the error debugging process. This in contrast to existing concurrency visualizations that focus on the debugging of performance problems...|$|R
