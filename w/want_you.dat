5|$|I <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> {{consisted}} of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked {{a change in}} musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics {{at the time of}} its release, I <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R, and neo soul.|$|E
5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2003, I <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> was reissued by Motown as a two-disc {{expanded}} edition release, featuring 24-bit digital remastering of {{the original}} album's recordings, previously unissued material, and a 24-page booklet, which contains the original LP liner notes by Marvin Gaye, as well as comprehensive essays by writers including David Ritz.|$|E

5|$|Though it {{was often}} hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had {{dedicated}} to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who {{is believed to have}} been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I <b>Want</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
5|$|I <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, {{also known as}} Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and the erotic, sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971).|$|E

25|$|Trump and Kiyosaki intersperse {{financial}} {{lessons with}} personal anecdotes from their respective careers. They elaborate on points previously raised in Why We <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to be Rich, and criticize {{a dearth of}} financial literacy education in the U.S. system. The authors warn of the middle-class squeeze and the harm this will cause to the American middle class. They praise entrepreneurship and advise aspiring business owners to embrace failure and learn from it. Trump and Kiyosaki end the book by extolling the economic benefits of immigration to the United States.|$|E

The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E

25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They <b>want</b> <b>you</b> for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|Midas Touch elaborates on points made by Trump and Kiyosaki {{in their}} prior work Why We <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to be Rich. The coauthors assert their ideas {{will lead to}} an uptick in the American economy. Trump and Kiyosaki lament the lack of {{financial}} literacy espoused in the U.S. education structure. They argue students should be taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk. They say those who do engage in risk will learn from their mistakes and be stronger for it.|$|E

25|$|Why We <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to Be Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to their}} work {{together}} on the book, Donald Trump had established himself {{in the business of}} real estate development and written The Art of the Deal, and Robert Kiyosaki authored The New York Times best seller Rich Dad Poor Dad. The coauthors became familiar with each other through encounters at the company The Learning Annex. Trump explained his motivation for wanting to work with Kiyosaki, saying he was motivated by their respective success with Trump's book The Art of the Deal and Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Trump and Kiyosaki first published Why We <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to be Rich as a private business venture together, forming a new company as a partnership called Rich Press.|$|E
25|$|The album also {{provided}} another first in both Motown and R music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album {{in a song}} cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. Let's Get It On repeated the suite-form arrangement of What's Going On, as would Gaye's later albums such as I <b>Want</b> <b>You,</b> Here, My Dear and In Our Lifetime.|$|E
