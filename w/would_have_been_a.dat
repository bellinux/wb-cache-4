5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> significant weakness, {{as it would have}} been easy to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, {{was a hot}} summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} blue sky. The fine weather {{almost certainly}} increased {{the size of the}} crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> much less attractive prospect.|$|E
5|$|The current 63rd Street Line was {{the final}} version of {{proposals}} for a northern midtown tunnel from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to the Second and Sixth Avenue lines, which date back to the IND Second System of the 1920s and 1930s. The current plans were drawn up in the 1960s under the MTA's Program For Action. In the original 1960s plans, there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> station (in addition to or as an alternative to 21st Street–Queensbridge) located farther east at Northern Boulevard, one block north of the Queens Plaza station of the Queens Boulevard line. There <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> pedestrian transfer passageway between the two stations.|$|E

5|$|The plans {{called for}} a two-track station which would be {{connected}} to the surface via elevators. At ground level, there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> vestibule with traveller facilities and ticket sales. The main entrance was to be from Balchensgate, with a secondary entrance from the street junction Elisenbergveien–Frognerveien.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} storm postponed the bi-annual Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda sailboat {{race for}} two consecutive days {{due to the}} forecast one of the storm. Subsequent reports from sailboats said that with the track of the storm, {{if not for the}} delay, there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> marine disaster.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} lord to {{concentrate}} on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants {{to take care of}} chores such as providing food. The household was run by a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate's written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although on a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious. An important role of the household servants was the preparation of food; the castle kitchens <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> busy place when the castle was occupied, called on to provide large meals. Without the presence of a lord's household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a castle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.|$|E

5|$|Although Sports Night was {{critically}} acclaimed, ABC {{canceled the}} show after two seasons {{due to its}} low ratings. Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels but declined all the offers as they were mainly contingent on his involvement which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> difficult prospect given that he was simultaneously writing The West Wing at that point.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, {{heterosexual}} sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as well because the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> violation of that ordinance.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Liverpool Football Club, he stated that if he wasn't a footballer he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> physio. On 12 September 2010, he was jailed for four months over a drunken attack on a taxi driver which had taken place on 9 August 2009 in Watford, Hertfordshire. He was tried for racially aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm but a jury acquitted him of that charge, but found him guilty of an alternative charge of assaulting the taxi driver.|$|E

5|$|In the 23 February 1859 {{edition of}} the Deseret News, the editors {{announced}} their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention to use them in the newsletter.

5|$|Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's {{appearance}} and immobility, {{complaining that the}} puppet had to be moved around the set to film different scenes. In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> CGI character {{similar to the one}} that appears in the Special Edition scene of A New Hope.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{debate whether}} an {{alliance}} between the Franks and Mongols would {{have been successful in}} shifting {{the balance of power in}} the region, and if it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> wise choice on the part of the Europeans. Traditionally, the Mongols tended to see outside parties as either subjects or enemies, with little room in the middle for a concept such as an ally.|$|E

5|$|Most of the mission's delays {{were caused}} by {{external}} tank issues on STS-133 Discovery. When Mark's twin brother Scott Kelly went to the ISS on October 7, 2010, STS-134 was scheduled {{to go to the}} station during Scott's mission. The potential rendezvous in space of the Kelly brothers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> first meeting of blood relatives in space. The delay of the launch of STS-134 ended the possibility of that happening.|$|E
5|$|Tech's Thomas gained six {{yards on}} a {{run up the}} middle, then Druckenmiller ran ahead for a one-yard gain. On third down, Tech {{committed}} a 10-yard penalty, negating what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> first-down run. A long pass on third down fell incomplete, and Tech punted {{for the first time}} in the quarter. The Longhorns fair caught the ball at their 30-yard line with 5:25 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Scott Wilson Report did not {{consider}} extending the line beyond Tweedbank due to the increased capital and operating costs of continuing further without a corresponding increase in passenger demand.

50|$|Coria {{estimates}} {{the size of}} the Loncosaurus type individual at about 5 m (16.4 feet) long. As a small to medium-sized ornithopod, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> agile bipedal herbivore.|$|R
50|$|Project Longshot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{conceptual}} interstellar spacecraft design. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> unmanned probe, {{intended to}} fly to and enter orbit around Alpha Centauri B powered by nuclear pulse propulsion.|$|R
5000|$|Although BlueSky Software, the {{developer}} of both Vectorman games, closed in 2001, a Vectorman {{game for the}} PlayStation 2 was announced in 2003 but was soon cancelled.

The main character <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> overhauled, receiving <b>a</b> vastly different design and a tinny and mechanical voice.|$|R
5|$|The lumber {{used in the}} {{construction}} of Fort Jackson was either sold for salvage or scavenged by squatters, most of whom were freed slaves traveling north in a search for new lives following the ending of slavery in the United States. Many settled {{in the area of the}} former Fort Runyon, and it seems likely that the lumber of Fort Jackson <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> ready source of firewood.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} moat {{around the}} tower <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> simple design, {{but it was}} redesigned in the 1460s to provide a walkway around {{the outside of the}} Great Tower. The niches in the walls of the walkway are of 17th-century origin, and would originally have held classical statues - the walkway would have provided a dignified way of admiring the Great Tower. It is likely that fish would have been bred in the moat.|$|E
5|$|Theros was a plane {{inspired}} by Greek mythology, containing many references to Greek mythological {{figures such as}} Prometheus and the pantheon of gods.

Through time travel, {{the result of the}} struggle between the ancient clans and the dragons was reversed and the dragons now reign over each of the five clans, which are both similar and different to their alternate-timeline predecessors.|$|E
