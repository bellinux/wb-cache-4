5|$|Love, Loss, and What I Wore is a play {{written by}} Nora and Delia Ephron {{based on the}} 1995 book {{of the same name}} by Ilene Beckerman. It is {{organized}} as a series of monologues and uses a rotating cast of five principal women. The subject matter of the monologues includes women's relationships and <b>wardrobes</b> and at times the interaction of the two, using the female wardrobe as a time capsule of a woman's life.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's <b>wardrobes.</b> So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|Prince Caspian {{has over}} 1,500 special effects shots, more than The Lion, the Witch and the <b>Wardrobes</b> 800 effects shots, yet the film had {{less time to}} {{complete}} them. The scale of special effects led Andrew Adamson to base production in the UK, {{to take advantage of}} new tax credits. Therefore, it legally qualifies as a British film. This also meant the director only had to walk five minutes from the editing room to supervise the effects. British visual effects companies the Moving Picture Company and Framestore CFC were hired to create the visual effects alongside Weta Digital. Framestore worked on Aslan, Trufflehunter and the door in the air; Scanline did the River-god; Weta created the werewolf, the wild bear and Miraz's castle; MPC and Escape Studios did the main battle, the tunnel scene, the castle assault, the council scenes and all the other creatures.|$|E
50|$|In the {{performing}} arts, the <b>wardrobe</b> is the actor's costumes, shoes, undergarments, hats and costume related personal props such as gloves, jewelry, parasols, fans and pocket books. The name <b>wardrobe</b> is a metonym for {{the contents of}} a <b>wardrobe.</b> In theater, a <b>wardrobe</b> supervisor is responsible for supervising all <b>wardrobe</b> related activities {{during the course of a}} theatrical run. A <b>wardrobe</b> department in film production employs costume designers and coordinators who clothe the performers.|$|R

25|$|A corset is {{a garment}} worn {{to hold and}} train the torso into a desired shape, {{traditionally}} a smaller waist or larger bottom, for aesthetic or medical purposes (either {{for the duration of}} wearing it or with a more lasting effect). Both men and women are known to wear corsets, though this item was for many years an integral part of women's <b>wardrobes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Designed by William Rumbold, the new {{building}} was built in 1855 {{at a cost of}} $50,000 at the corner of Olive and 15th streets. The building had three full stories and a basement, nine classrooms, a 700-seat auditorium, and 16 smaller rooms used as libraries and <b>wardrobes.</b> It initially was built with a capacity of slightly less than 500 students. By 1859, course requirements for entrance had been developed, and two courses of study (general or classical) were available to students.|$|E
25|$|The {{fittings}} of the first-class {{lounge and}} part of the aft grand staircase {{can be found in the}} White Swan Hotel, in Alnwick, Northumberland, England. A variety of panelling, light fixtures, flooring, doors, and windows from Olympic were installed in a paint factory in Haltwhistle, Northumberland, until they were auctioned in 2004. One suite at Sparth House Hotel, Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire has the furniture from one of the state rooms, including light fitting, sink, <b>wardrobes</b> and fireplace. The crystal and ormolu electrolier from the lounge is installed in the Cutlers' Hall in Sheffield.|$|E

50|$|The building's legacy survives in {{the street}} names <b>Wardrobe</b> Terrace and <b>Wardrobe</b> Place, built {{on the site of}} the <b>Wardrobe,</b> and in the curious {{designation}} of the nearby church, St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe (also destroyed in the fire, but built anew by Sir Christopher Wren).|$|R
25|$|For {{the second}} series, the Moonbase uniforms were updated and {{coloured}} decorative stitching and turtleneck collars were added, as were various badges and patches. Red, navy, or dark-green jackets also appeared, originally on just the senior staff, then {{on many of}} the male extras. The female characters tended to wear skirts and knee high boots throughout the second series, rather than the flared trousers used in Year One. The costumes for Year Two were designed by Emma Porteous, who later designed the <b>wardrobes</b> for several James Bond films.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} comprises six {{rooms with}} the former lounge and dining room to the east separated from four former bedrooms to the west by a central hall and lobby running {{from the front door}} to the kitchen at the rear. The lounge and dining room share a large double- sided fireplace of face-brick. Two of the former bedrooms retain built-in <b>wardrobes,</b> drawers and shelving. The walls throughout the house and onto the verandahs have a single lining of vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards with ceilings lined in asbestos cement sheeting and finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
25|$|A louvred door has {{fixed or}} movable wooden fins (often called slats or louvers) which permit open {{ventilation}} while preserving privacy and preventing {{the passage of}} light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for <b>wardrobes</b> and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form window shutters. Double louvred doors were introduced into Seagate, built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy {{in that it is}} impossible to see through the fins in any direction.|$|E

25|$|Users could access their <b>wardrobe</b> {{from the}} Menu Screen {{at any time}} and location, except when in another user's {{personal}} apartment. The <b>wardrobe</b> contained two sections: one was the main <b>wardrobe</b> for frequently used items (capacity of 500), and the other was a storage section for less frequently used items. New items were marked accordingly. Users could also filter the <b>wardrobe</b> view to only display favourite, purchased, rewards, or recently acquired items.|$|R

25|$|Episode four: Chris and Tracey - Tracey and Chris {{have been}} married {{just over a year}} and were very much in love. But even though they were very happy together, they feel under {{constant}} pressure from others around them, because Tracey is forty-two and her husband Chris is just twenty-four. With an eighteen-year age gap, Chris is often mistaken for Tracey's son. Woodall and Susannah see that both their <b>wardrobes</b> needed revamping and modernising which will help the couple bridge their age gap. Tracey and Chris hope that by dressing differently they might begin to look more like a couple and be more accepted together. Constantine helps Tracey to overcome her body insecurities by investing in some good items that will emphasize her good figure. As a result of a new appearance, Tracey begins to feel more glamorous. The pair are given a new look and are once again reunited.|$|E
25|$|Some principalities taxed windows, doors, or {{cabinets}} {{to reduce}} consumption of imported glass and hardware. Armoires, hutches, and <b>wardrobes</b> {{were employed to}} evade taxes on doors and cabinets. In some circumstances, taxes are also used to enforce public policy like congestion charge (to cut road traffic and encourage public transport) in London. In Tsarist Russia, taxes were clamped on beards. Today, one of the most-complicated taxation systems worldwide is in Germany. Three quarters of the world's taxation literature refers to the German system. Under the German system, there are 118 laws, 185 forms, and 96,000 regulations, spending €3.7 billion to collect the income tax. In the United States, the IRS has about 1,177 forms and instructions, 28.4111 megabytes of Internal Revenue Code which contained 3.8 million words as of 1 February 2010, numerous tax regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations, and suppmentary material in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Today, governments in more advanced economies (i.e. Europe and North America) tend to rely more on direct taxes, while developing economies (i.e. India and several African countries) rely more on indirect taxes.|$|E
25|$|The three vessels {{had several}} levels of {{passenger}} accommodation, with slight variations between the ships. However, no class was neglected. The First Class passengers enjoyed luxurious cabins {{and many were}} equipped with private bathrooms, a novelty at the time. The two most luxurious suites included a private promenade deck, sitting room, two walk-in <b>wardrobes,</b> two bedrooms, a private bath and lavatory. Each class had its own large dining saloon, while First Class also featured a lavish Grand Staircase descending in seven levels through the ship, a Georgian-style smoking room, a Veranda Cafe decorated with palm trees, a swimming pool, Turkish bath, gymnasium, and several other places for meals and entertainment. The Olympic-class liners were the first British ships to contain separate restaurants independent of the dining saloons. These were in imitation of the precedent set on the German Hamburg-Amerika liner Amerika (1905), which had included a restaurant serving French haute cuisine run by the famous hotelier César Ritz. Olympic and Titanic had À la Carte Restaurants aft on B-Deck run by the London restaurateur Luigi Gatti and his staff, all of whom died in the sinking of Titanic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wardrobe</b> stylists are {{sometimes}} represented by agencies {{that specialize in}} representing <b>wardrobe</b> stylists, hair stylists and makeup artists. When a <b>wardrobe</b> stylist is represented by an agency, the agency usually books all of their work or assignments for a fee, usually ranging between 10% and 20% of the stylist's fee. The agency ensures that the stylist's needs are met, typically guaranteeing that transportation and travel and accommodations are all taken care of before the <b>wardrobe</b> stylist takes an assignment. Agencies usually expedite the client's payment {{and make sure that}} the <b>wardrobe</b> stylist is paid in full within 30 to 60 days of completion of the assignment.|$|R

500|$|In 2002 the {{accommodation}} in {{the tower}} was criticised - partly due to overcrowding, but also regarding {{the state of the}} building itself, with damp <b>wardrobes,</b> rusty bath plugholes, stained baths and generally [...] "damp and squalid conditions".

500|$|Ritz shunned {{free-standing}} <b>wardrobes</b> due to {{his fear}} of dust settling on them; instead he built cupboards [...] into the rooms with doors matching the panelling. Ritz's ideas of cleanliness and hygiene prompted him to originally have all bedrooms painted in white and all beds made of brass, not wood, for the same reasons. Anything new or potentially useful was available to the guests of the Ritz.|$|E
500|$|This {{bedroom is}} also less richly ornamented than {{many in the}} castle, making {{extensive}} use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some [...] "spartan" [...] relief before {{the culmination of the}} castle in Lady Bute's Bedroom but Floud considered the result [...] "thin" [...] and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers. The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use, lacking <b>wardrobes</b> and other storage.|$|E
