50|$|The {{problem may}} not be that talent and skill <b>are</b> <b>rewarded,</b> but that the <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> based on {{relative}} talent and skill. If only the top 20% of a game's players <b>are</b> <b>rewarded,</b> 80% must <b>be</b> receiving little <b>reward,</b> even if objectively they are highly talented. If {{there is no hope}} in the future of these players being rewarded, they will likely leave the game, causing the population to shrink, and thus reducing {{the number of people who}} can be in the top 20%. Grinding has the benefit that, although only 20% of the population may <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> at any given time, 100% of the population will have the potential to <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> in the future, and will have no reason to quit.|$|R
