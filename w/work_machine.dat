File timestamps {{are commonly used}} to detect changes in tools like Make or Apache Ant. Timestamps can be problematic when builds are distributed across multiple hosts due to issues with clock synchronization. One of Bazel's goals is to enable distributed and parallel builds on a remote cloud infrastructure.

40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} {{technology offers}} {{a new way to}} develop workflow system. Migrating workflow system based on cloud computing paradigm (MWfSCC) can obtain high system performance and service quality in cloud computing environment, where an agent (called CMI) is deployed to fulfill several tasks by migrating to other computers (called <b>work</b> <b>machines).</b> In general, task execution involves several input data sets usually placed on distributed <b>work</b> <b>machines.</b> On the other hand, task execution will also generate some data sets, which may be regard as input data sets for other tasks. Traditionally, CMI moves to <b>work</b> <b>machines</b> one by one for the reason that tasks execution places are also distributed. In this way, {{it is very important to}} arrange the tasks on different <b>work</b> <b>machines</b> in order to reduce CMI’s movements. In this paper, we propose a tasks distribution strategy based on cluster in MWfSCC, which contains tasks classifications and arrangements. Simulations show that tasks distribution strategy based on cluster can effectively reduce CMIs movements during workflow execution, and hence can significantly improve the performance o...|$|R

Companies that provide short blocks may also offer performance improving engine <b>work.</b> <b>Machine</b> shop work can increase performance by boring out the engine to increase cylinder diameter (which increases internal volume), balancing rotating assemblies (such as the crankshaft), installing a higher performance camshaft, etc. Bored-out engines require larger pistons and new piston rings.
