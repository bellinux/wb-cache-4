40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} small-size screw expander for the energy conversion of hot spring water are described in this report. Recently, the screw expander has been recognized as an effective machine for low temperature energy conversion, i. e. hot spring water. Usually in the low temperature energy conversion cycle, organic <b>working</b> <b>mediums</b> such as NH 3 or fron are used. With the organic <b>working</b> <b>mediums,</b> the performance tests of screw expander under the same conditions of a practical conversion cycle are very difficult. On the other hand, usually small-size screw expanders may be produced by adapting the massproduced screw compressors. We therefore made compression tests with air using small-size screw expanders. For a small-size screw expander, the compression tests with air are rather easy than the expansion tests with air or organic <b>working</b> <b>mediums.</b> If {{the performance of the}} expansion with organic <b>working</b> <b>mediums</b> could be estimated by the compression tests with air, it might be an effective technique for the design of the low temperature energy conversion cycle using the small-size screw expander. In this paper, we report the experimental results of the compression tests with air, of the expansion tests with air or R II, and comprise the results. The principal specifications of the two testing screw expanders are the built-in volume ratios are 2. 0 and 2. 4, and the exit displacement, 0. 816 m 3 / 1000 rev., which is the same for both expanders...|$|R

50|$|For shorter {{cycle times}} the <b>working</b> <b>medium</b> cannot follow adiabatically {{the change in}} the {{external}} parameter.This leads to friction-like phenomena. Extra power is required to drive the system faster.The signature of such dynamics is the development of coherence causing extra dissipation.Surprisingly the dynamics leading to friction is quantized meaning that frictionless solutions to the adiabatic expansion/compressioncan be found in finite time. As a result, optimization has to be carried out only with respect to the time allocatedto heat transport. In this regime the quantum feature of coherence degrades the performance.Optimal frictionless performance is obtained when the coherence can be cancelled.|$|E
50|$|Biomass {{power plant}} size is often driven by biomass {{availability}} {{in close proximity}} as transport costs of the (bulky) fuel play {{a key factor in}} the plant's economics. Rail and especially shipping on waterways can reduce transport costs significantly, which has led to a global biomass market. To make small plants of 1 MWel economically profitable those power plants need to be equipped with technology that is able to convert biomass to useful electricity with high efficiency such as ORC technology, a cycle similar to the water steam power process just with an organic <b>working</b> <b>medium.</b> Such small power plants can be found in Europe.|$|E

40|$|In this two-part publication, {{various aspects}} of thermo-fluid {{modelling}} for gas turbines are described {{and their impact on}} performance calculations and emissions predictions at aircraft system level is assessed. Accurate and reliable fluid modelling is essential for any gas turbine performance simulation software as it provides a robust foundation for building advanced multi-disciplinary modelling capabilities. Caloric properties for generic and semi-generic gas turbine performance simulation codes can be calculated at various levels of fidelity; selection of the fidelity level is dependent upon the objectives of the simulation and execution time constraints. However, rigorous fluid modelling may not necessarily improve performance simulation accuracy unless all modelling assumptions and sources of uncertainty are aligned to the same level. Certain modelling aspects such as the introduction of chemical kinetics, and dissociation effects, may reduce computational speed and this is of significant importance for radical space exploration and novel propulsion cycle assessment. This paper describes and compares fluid models, based on different levels of fidelity, which have been developed for an industry standard gas turbine performance simulation code and an environmental assessment tool for novel propulsion cycles. The latter comprises the following modules: engine performance, aircraft performance, emissions prediction, and environmental impact. The work presented aims to fill the current literature gap by: (i) investigating the common assumptions made in thermo-fluid modelling for gas turbines and their effect on caloric properties and (ii) assessing the impact of uncertainties on performance calculations and emissions predictions at aircraft system level. In Part I of this two-part publication, a comprehensive analysis of thermo-fluid modelling for gas turbines is presented and the fluid models developed are discussed in detail. Common technical models, used for calculating caloric properties, are compared while typical assumptions made in fluid modelling, and the uncertainties induced, are examined. Several analyses, which demonstrate the effects of composition, temperature and pressure on caloric properties of <b>working</b> <b>mediums</b> for gas turbines, are presented. The <b>working</b> <b>mediums</b> examined include dry air and combustion products for various fuels and H/C ratios. The errors induced by ignoring dissociation effects are also discussed...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is often}} seen that the tools used for DFSS {{techniques}} vary widely from those used for DMAIC Six Sigma. In particular, DMAIC, DDICA practitioners often use new or existing mechanical drawings and manufacturing process instructions as the originating information to perform their analysis, while DFSS practitioners often use simulations and parametric system design/analysis tools to predict both cost and performance of candidate system architectures. While it can be claimed that two processes are similar, in practice the <b>working</b> <b>medium</b> differs enough so that DFSS requires different tool sets in order to perform its design tasks. DMAIC, IDOV and Six Sigma may still be used during depth-first plunges into the system architecture analysis and for [...] "back end" [...] Six Sigma processes; DFSS provides system design processes used in front-end complex system designs.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} approaches to transfer thermal energy to electricity, and the technologies to do so have existed for several decades. The organic Rankine cycle, offered by companies such as Ormat, is a very known approach, whereby an organic substance is used as <b>working</b> <b>medium</b> instead of water. The benefit is that this process can reject heat at lower temperatures {{for the production of}} electricity than the regular water steam cycle. [...] An example of use of the steam Rankine cycle is the Cyclone Waste Heat Engine.Another established approach is by using a thermoelectric, such as those offered by Alphabet Energy, where a change in temperature across a semiconductor material creates a voltage through a phenomenon known as the Seebeck effect. A related approach is the use of thermogalvanic cells, where a temperature difference gives rise to an electric current in an electrochemical cell.|$|E

A horse must be well-confirmed in its training to perform the passage, and must be proficient in collecting while remaining energetic, calm, and supple.
