2500|$|Now {{it was my}} turn to shout! [...] "Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? I don't want to ram her!" [...] Everyone was out on the <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> {{except me}} and no one other than myself was talking.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} Japanese shells that hit cruiser, {{destroyed}} the port <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> front <b>bridge,</b> set fire in chart house and broke the fore shrouds. Junior navigating officer midshipman Count Alexey Nirod was killed, all personnel on range finding station #1 were killed or wounded.|$|R
25|$|By {{this time}} the Helena was making good time through the water again and picking up {{momentum}} heading straight for the cloud. The wheel was still turned hard left and I {{had no idea where}} either the Juneau or the San Francisco were. Total silence reigned in the pilot house and on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most pickups for bowed string instruments, such as cello, violin, {{and double}} bass, are piezoelectric. These may be inlaid into the bridge, laid between the bridge {{feet and the}} top of the instrument, or, less frequently, wedged under a <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge.</b> Some pickups are {{fastened}} {{to the top of the}} instrument with removable putty.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} now the {{boarding}} <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> Haydon <b>Bridge</b> High School, {{one of a few}} state boarding schools. Students who live in or beyond Otterburn stay at Ridley Hall during term-time, with most returning home at weekends. During weekends and school holidays, the hall is open for weddings and conferences, but it is not open to the general public.|$|R
50|$|Lord Hailsham was a trawler {{converted}} {{to be used}} in anti-submarine warfare. She had a 4 in gun forward and 20 mm Oerlikon machine guns on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge,</b> which could be used for anti-aircraft and anti-ship actions. She was also equipped with ASDIC anti-submarine sonar detection equipment, and carried up to 14 depth charges. Later on, she was equipped with a Holman Projector.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>wing</b> walls <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> are <b>of</b> RCC and {{are fixed}} with {{abutments}} {{and have no}} weep holes. Railing type <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> is <b>of</b> R.C.C post and steel rail. The bridge has [...] wide sidewalk at both sides. Meghna Bridge also has infrastructure of drainage.|$|R
500|$|Most {{ships of}} Havocks class had the rear torpedo tubes {{replaced}} by a 12-pounder AA gun after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, {{but it is not}} clear if she received this modification. Other changes may have included exchanging her two quadruple [...]50-calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform and another pair on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>wing</b> walls <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> are <b>of</b> RCC and {{are fixed}} with {{abutments}} {{and have no}} weep holes. Railing type <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> is <b>of</b> R.C.C post and steel rail. The bridge has 0.80 m wide sidewalk at both sides. Meghna Bridge also has infrastructure of drainage.|$|R
50|$|On 7 December, Shaw {{was still}} drydocked, {{receiving}} adjustments to her depth charge mechanisms. During the Japanese attack, she took three hits: two bombs through the forward machine gun platform, and one through the port <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge.</b> Fires {{spread through the}} ship. By 0925, all fire-fighting facilities were exhausted, and the order to abandon ship was given. Efforts to flood the dock were only partially successful; and, shortly after 0930, her forward magazine exploded.|$|R
500|$|The torpedo {{control system}} was much the same, {{although}} entirely {{separate from the}} gunnery system. 8 × 30 target designation binoculars were mounted on each side <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> and transmitted the target's bearing to the torpedo director located above the primary gunnery DCT above the bridge. It used a separate [...] OPL Modèle 1935 stereoscopic rangefinder to provide the bearing and range to a Modèle 1933 mechanical computer which calculated the torpedo firing angle. This {{was sent to the}} remotely controlled torpedo tubes, and the command to fire could be given by either the torpedo director or either of the secondary positions on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{underway}} in the South China Sea on 8 September 1965, Vega {{was the scene}} of an unusual change of command, when Capt. T. A. Melusky relieved Capt. R. E. Hill as commanding officer. The ceremony took place at 0128, on the port <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge,</b> by the light of red-filtered flashlights, with the ship darkened during an underway replenishment of Constellation (CVA-64). The storeship returned to the United States in October 1965. Vega was again deployed to the 7th Fleet from February to May 1966. During this time, the ship replenished her first two nuclear-powered ships, Bainbridge (DLGN-25) and Enterprise (CVAN-65).|$|R
500|$|Most {{ships of}} Heros class had the rear torpedo tubes {{replaced}} by a 12-pounder AA gun after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, {{but it is not}} clear if she underwent this refurbishment as she was deployed in the Mediterranean until 1943. Other changes made before her conversion to an escort destroyer in 1943 probably included exchanging her two quadruple [...]50-calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform and another pair on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the ship's <b>bridge.</b> The ship's director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge were most likely removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar during the conversion, as was the replacement of 'B' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, and the addition of a Type 286 short-range surface search radar. Two QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns were fitted on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> her <b>bridge</b> to deal with U-boats at short ranges. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased. Late in the war, her Type 286 was {{replaced by a}} Type 291 radar.|$|R
500|$|The {{other changes}} {{made to the}} ship's {{armament}} during the war (exactly when these occurred is unknown) included the replacement of 'B' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, exchanging the two quadruple [...]50-calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform and another pair were fitted on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> her <b>bridge,</b> {{and the removal of}} her 12-pounder AA gun. Type 286 short-range surface search radar was also added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|R
500|$|Other {{changes made}} during the war (exactly when these {{occurred}} is unknown) included the replacement of 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, exchanging her two quadruple [...]50-calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, {{and the removal of}} her 12-pounder AA gun.

2500|$|Pennsylvania Sun was {{traveling}} from Port Arthur, Texas to Belfast, with 107.500 barrels of Navy fuel oil on 15 July 1942. At 7:49am, the U-571 fired one torpedo at the unescorted Pennsylvania Sun while {{the ship was}} steaming on a zigzag course at 14 knots [...] West of Key West, Florida in the Gulf of Mexico (...) [...] The torpedo struck amidships {{on the port side}} between the tanks number 5 and 6. The torpedo also blew away the port <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge,</b> killing quartermaster James B. Mortimer and able seaman John C. Riley. The ship's cargo ignited and the ship quickly became an inferno.|$|R

5000|$|On Friday, 22 August 1941, {{during the}} night Captain Christian was {{standing}} on the starboard <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> when Empire Oak was struck by a torpedo fired from [...] on the starboard side of the engine room. She sank within seconds with the captain been washed off the bridge. The destroyer [...] then launched a depth charge attack on U-564, the shock waves of which caused distress and injuries to the survivors in the water. Captain Christian was in the water for over two hours with his chief officer plus the chief officer from Aguila before the corvette [...] found them, unfortunately during the rescue the chief officer from the Aguila became separated and was lost.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} and third planes were setting up for their attack. Tatum drove one of them off with gunfire, but the other pilot {{continued}} on toward the ship until a hail of gunfire caused him to lose control of his aircraft. He banked sharply to the right, passed by Tatums port side, and splashed about 100yards astern. Within seconds, his cautious comrade renewed his attack. He dove on the fast transport, barely missing the port <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> her <b>bridge,</b> and Tatums antiaircraft fire followed him up as he climbed, did a wing-over, and prepared to come in again. His third and final attack carried him across the ship's fantail and into the water about 50feet from her starboard quarter.|$|R
50|$|Preparations in New Guinea preceded in the Lingayen assault, {{in which}} Callaway {{distinguished}} {{herself as a}} member of the Blue Beach Attack Group. As the invasion force sailed north, desperate Japanese kamikaze attacks were launched in a determined effort to break up the landings, and on 8 January 1945, a kamikaze broke through heavy antiaircraft fire to crash on the starboard <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> Callaways <b>bridge.</b> The resulting fires were contained, but 29 of Callaways crew were killed and 22 wounded. Despite this loss, the attack transport resumed active duty the following day. Temporary repairs at Ulithi put her back in action by early February, when she carried Marine reinforcements from Guam to Iwo Jima, and returned with wounded from that battle to Guam, arriving on 8 March.|$|R
5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April and, for the next two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout lightship, she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side, crumpling that <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge,</b> penetrating the well and berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward fire room. One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later. The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|R
500|$|Little data on Hurricanes {{modifications}} {{during the}} war has survived, although {{it is known that}} she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun by October 1940. The ship's short-range AA armament may have been augmented by two Oerlikon 20mm guns on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the ship's <b>bridge</b> and the [...]50-calibre machine gun mounts may have also been replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. The ship's director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge may have been removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted midway through the war. The ship probably also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast.|$|R
500|$|By October 1940, Foxhound had her rear {{torpedo tube}} mount {{replaced}} by a 12-pounder AA gun. While the ship was under repair in late 1941, her existing director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge was {{replaced by a}} new director with a Type 285 gunnery radar mounted on its roof. These fed target data to the new Fuze-Keeping Clock, an analogue fire-control system that calculated the gunnery information for the guns. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder {{at the top of her}} foremast. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by two [...] Oerlikon guns on the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the ship's <b>bridge,</b> a pair on the enlarged searchlight platform and, probably, another pair were added on the quarterdeck.|$|R

5000|$|After the Hull {{was ordered}} to change course to 140 degrees, ostensibly by Admiral Halsey [...] "to see what they were made of," [...] the wind {{increased}} to over 100 knots. At about 11:00 hours, on 18 December, Hull became locked [...] "in irons", in the trough of the mountainous sea. Unable to steer with the north wind on her port beam, yawing between 80 and 100 degrees, the whaleboat and depth charges were swept off. As the roll increased to 70 degrees, she was pinned down by a gust as the sea flooded the pilot house and poured down the stacks. All hands worked feverishly to maintain integrity and keep the ship afloat during the heavy rolls, but finally, {{in the words of}} her commander, Lt. Cmdr James A. Marks, [...] "the ship remained over on her side at an angle of 80 degrees or more as the water flooded into her upper structures. I remained on the port <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> until the water flooded up to me, then I stepped off into the water as the ship rolled over on her way down". A later finding was that additional sea water ballast could possibly have helped the ship recover from the 70-degree roll.|$|R

5000|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. Walke engaged in a detached mission in support of minesweeping operations to clear the waters for entry of our heavy surface and amphibious forces preparatory to the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, Philippine Islands, 6 January 1945. Operating without gun support of other surface ships when four Japanese suicide planes were detected flying low overland to attack simultaneously, Commander Davis boldly took his position in the exposed <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> and directed control to pick up the leading plane and open fire. Alert and fearless as the Walkes deadly fire sent the first target crashing into the water and caught the second as it passed close over the bridge to plunge into the sea off portside, he remained steadfast in the path of the third plane plunging swiftly to crash the after end <b>of</b> the <b>bridge</b> structure. Seriously wounded when the plane struck, drenched with gasoline and immediately enveloped in flames, he conned the Walke in the midst of the wreckage; he rallied his command to heroic efforts; he exhorted his officers and men to save the ship and, still on his feet, saw the barrage from his guns destroy the fourth suicide bomber. With the fires under control and the safety of the ship assured, he consented to be carried below. Succumbing several hours later, Commander Davis, by his example of valor and his unhesitating self-sacrifice, steeled the fighting spirit of his command into unyielding purpose in completing a vital mission. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|R
