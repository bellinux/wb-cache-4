He worked for a while as a disc jockey at radio station KFML, and continued to produce albums in New York and Los Angeles, such as the J. Geils Band's 1971 album The Morning After, recorded at the Los Angeles Record Plant. He did extensive work at the Colorado studio Caribou Ranch, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> be the center of his operations {{for the rest of the}} 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{testimony}} {{indicated that}} Detective Scott inquired of a railroad engineer named Rush, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> {{be the worst}} place for a train wreck. Rush pointed out the high bridge where, if a rail was pulled, the train would crash three or four hundred feet down an embankment, killing or injuring all on the train. Scott told Rush {{to be on the}} lookout for damaged track that night at that spot. Later that evening Rush stopped his train, walked ahead on the track and discovered that spikes had been pulled.|$|E

25|$|Her Imperial Majesty Empress Elisabeth of Austria visited Summerhill House in February 1879. The {{preparations}} were a well kept secret; {{the first}} thing that had to be sorted is <b>where</b> <b>would</b> she stay. Meath hunted the best hounds and Summerhill was centrally located, so Summerhill was chosen. When she was on one hunt in Dunshaughlin, as they came to Maynooth, they came across two men repairing a demesne wall of the Catholic seminary. As the deer they were hunting jumped into the land of the college, Her Imperial Majesty followed without knowing where she was going and nearly jumped on the President of the college, Professor William Walsh, who later became His Grace The Most Reverend Dr. William Walsh, Lord Primate of Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Dublin.|$|E
25|$|The first {{matters to}} {{establish}} were the design principles and layout. Since {{this was to}} be the first non-denominational chapel for a European garden cemetery, there were no existing guidelines. What should it look like? <b>Where</b> <b>would</b> it be most appropriately located within the park? How should it be aligned in the landscape? And which direction should it face? William Hosking, in discussion with George Collison II developed a plan to site the novel chapel {{at the very heart of}} Abney Park foregoing any positioning close to the main entrance. The aim was that, once the pine trees that were planted along the Chapel Ride matured, the chapel would gradually be revealed through a sylvan landscape approach drive. The sinuously designed Chapel Ride was therefore lined with Bhutan Pine trees on its south side, contributing an attractive odoriferous all-year effect. Not only could nature be appreciated, but the main entrance (with its Egyptian revival building style) would not be eclipsed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the {{jewellery}} trade {{was considered the}} most lucrative in the city with jewellers being {{some of the best}} paid workers in the city. There were also more people employed in the trade than any other in the city. Boys were given apprenticeships at the age of 14 and earned four shillings on average. This would increase annually until they were 21 <b>where</b> <b>would</b> work from 8am till 7pm. Although, it was common for jewellers to work overtime. Apprentices generally did not require any qualifications but style became a study within the industry and one jeweller's firm required all apprentices to attend the Birmingham School of Art. Families generally were not employed in the trade due to the cleanliness and careful manipulations needed in the crafting of certain pieces. Most families earned income {{as a result of the}} trade by producing leather or paper boxes which were used extensively by jewellers to protect finishes articles.|$|E

500|$|Frank Arthur [...] "Bones" [...] Jenner (surname often misspelled Genor; 2 November 1903– 8 May 1977) was an Australian evangelist. His {{signature}} {{approach to}} evangelism {{was to ask}} people on George Street, Sydney, [...] "If you died within 24 hours, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> you be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] Born and raised in England, he contracted African trypanosomiasis {{at the age of}} twelve and suffered from narcolepsy {{for the rest of his}} life. After some time, he joined the Royal Navy, but deserted in New York and joined the United States Navy. When he was 24, he deserted again while in Australia. He subsequently worked for the Royal Australian Navy until he bought his way out in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in late 1880, {{letters from}} Pedro II to the Countess of Barral reveal a man grown world-weary {{with age and}} having an {{increasingly}} alienated and pessimistic outlook. In them he frequently expresses [...] "his loneliness and his desire to escape into her company." [...] The Emperor entertained a fantasy of leaving everything behind and realizing his cherished ambition of taking up a life in Europe, as he expressed it: [...] "and I, were I to enjoy my total independence, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> I be? Guess." [...] This strong desire to retire to a less circumscribed life abroad was a constant presence throughout the 1880s. Despite the dichotomy between reverie and reality, he remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the Imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm.|$|E

She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. <b>Where</b> <b>would</b> she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now.

500|$|The {{group and}} the music {{industry}} were unsure how fans would receive the tour beforehand. During {{the first week of}} shows, Bono said, [...] "This show is a real roller coaster ride, and some people will want to get off, I'm sure." [...] He remained optimistic that their devoted fans would continue following them, but cautioned {{he had no intention of}} resisting the glamour and fame: [...] "Oh, but it's fun to be carried away by the hype. <b>Where</b> <b>would</b> you be without the hype?... You can't pretend all the promotion and all the fanfare is not happening." [...] Some hardcore fans, particularly in the US, objected to the tour as a blatant sellout to commercial values, while others misinterpreted the tour's mocking of excess, believing that, according to VH1's Legends, [...] "U2 had 'lost it' and that Bono had become an egomaniac". Many Christian fans were offended the band's antics and believed they had abandoned their religious faith.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{affirmed that}} the scene {{reestablished}} The Walking Dead to full form, {{as well as}} redeemed the season's [...] "general gutlessness thus far." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and observed that it was effective {{enough to keep the}} viewers chattering until the succeeding episode. Handlen summated: [...] "The Sophia reveal is a punch in the gut, because narrative fiction teaches us the longer someone stays missing, the better the chance they'll turn up alive; otherwise, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> the drama be? By using the little girl in this way, the show transforms what should've been anti-climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline. It's not enough to make the bad parts of the earlier episodes great, but it does show that the writers had more on their mind than stalling." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger felt that albeit predictable, the segment was [...] "well executed". Josh Wigler of MTV said that the storyline ended in [...] "a much darker way than anyone could have imagined." ...|$|E

500|$|Out of {{gratitude}} to God for giving him salvation, Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism, and aimed {{to talk with}} ten different people every day thenceforward. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism. He probably spoke with more than 100,000 people in total, hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity. He kept religious tracts in his shirt pocket where he had previously kept his rabbit's foot, and he often gave these tracts to people he met. He also kept a card in his pocket with Philippians 4:13 on {{it in order to}} give himself courage in evangelising. This verse reads, [...] "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." [...] While engaging in these activities, Jenner would normally wear a white shirt, black shoes, and trousers, and sometimes a navy greatcoat. Usually evangelising on George Street, Sydney, Jenner asked many people the same question: [...] "If you died within 24 hours, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> you be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] If they were willing to engage in conversation with him, he would invite them either to his home or to a local church. The question became known as [...] "the Frank Jenner question". Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II. On Saturday nights during the war, Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon.|$|E
