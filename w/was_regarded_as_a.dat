5|$|As expected, Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour.

Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he was jealous of his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E

5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such as gold, copper, and iron {{may have been}} noticed in prehistory and, {{in light of their}} malleability, led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons.

5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable.

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it <b>was</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which <b>was</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprising move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E

5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it).

It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fungus}} {{is one of}} the most common in Central Europe, the species was not validly {{described}} until 1968 by German mycologist Frieder Gröger.

After Roger Heim and A.Leclair described L.semisanguifluus in 1950, this fungus was referred to as the latter. L.fennoscandicus was separated from L.deterrimus in 1998 by Annemieke T. Verbeken and Jan Vesterholt and was classified as a separate species.|$|E
