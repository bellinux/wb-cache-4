"Give Me Your Eyes" [...] {{is a song}} by {{contemporary}} Christian musician Brandon Heath from his second album, <b>What</b> <b>If</b> <b>We.</b> It was released in July 2008 as the album's lead single and quickly gained success. It sold nearly 6,000 downloads in the first week, and became 2008's highest-debuting Christian track at the time. It soon placed at No.1 on Christian radio charts, and held the position for multiple consecutive weeks. At the end of 2008, {{it was the second}} most-played song of the year on Christian contemporary hit radio.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's meaning {{originated}} {{with a discussion}} between Brandon Heath and friend and songwriter Jason Ingram. [...] "We had a conversation over Chinese food that we wished we could have God’s perspective on things", Heath said. [...] "If we did have His perspective, we'd wish we could have it {{for long periods of}} time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning." [...] He soon began to pen a song about the idea, co-writing [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] with Ingram. Prior to recording <b>What</b> <b>If</b> <b>We,</b> Heath had written 40 possible tracks for the album, and although the song was not his top favorite, he noted that [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was [...] "one of the first that really stuck out." ...|$|E

The New York Times highlighted Heath's Grammy Award-nominated <b>What</b> <b>If</b> <b>We</b> album {{as one of}} the best Grammy nominees in Christian music that year, saying; [...] "Mr. Heath's sense of wonder is firmly intact — 'Give Me Your Eyes,' which is nominated for best gospel song, is a breezy statement of humble devotion." [...] The song was featured on USA Todays top ten [...] "pick of the week" [...] playlist in the beginning of March 2009; the magazine's editor and music critic Brian Mansfield said, [...] "Grammy and Dove Award nominations are attracting a second look for Heath's song about seeing life's big picture." [...] Jesus Freak Hideout's Matthew Watson said of Heath's future music efforts: [...] "it could be really outstanding if he sticks to more upbeat songs like 'Give Me Your Eyes'." ...|$|E

[...] When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, [...] "What? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> love it?" [...] It didn't come to that, luckily. I said to Yoko, [...] "Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out.

[...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records.

During the trip, Spotnitz met a [...] "friend of a friend," [...] who constantly mentioned an [...] "image that freaked him out."

[...] The mental image intrigued Spotnitz, who later postulated, [...] "How could you create a story where blood {{comes out of a}} tube of toothpaste?" [...] Due to the strangeness of the idea, Spotnitz was unable to think of any real-world scenarios having likeness to the image, so he began to look into [...] "dreams and nightmares." [...] He eventually {{came up with the idea}} of a cult trying to reach a higher plane of existence, but instead stumbling into a [...] "lower place, a darker plane." [...] Spotnitz later explained: [...] "What if the higher plane is a darker plane, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> think we're reaching up but we're reaching down." [...] Complementarily, the episode's title, [...] "Via Negativa," [...] means [...] "Negative Way" [...] in Latin. [...] This type of theology, more commonly referred to as apophatic theology, attempts to describe God by expanding upon what God is not.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E
