5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob and Patrick protest {{the construction of a}} highway that <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> Jellyfish Fields.|$|E
5|$|Lily, a {{reformed}} supervillainess and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible and CoreFire. She claims {{to come from}} the far future, having been sent back to prevent an ecological disaster that <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> humanity. However, she later is revealed to be Erica Lowenstein, the Lois Lane-like one-time girlfriend of CoreFire. She is super-strong, invulnerable and transparent.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{propose that the}} Founding Fathers never {{intended}} for District residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim that such a move <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> {{the notion of a}} separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.|$|E
50|$|In April 1945, the 9th Parachute Division <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> {{while trying}} to contain a Russian {{bridgehead}} {{on the west bank}} of the River Oder. What remained of the unit <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> {{while trying to}} defend Berlin from the Red Army.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1945, the 10th Parachute Division <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> by the Red Army in Austria despite {{putting up}} a heroic effort. [...] The division's {{artillery}} battalion was destroyed in Feldbach by the Red Army. What remained of the unit <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> north of Bruenn.|$|R
30|$|Using this principle, embryos from genetic selection, such {{as those}} with cystic {{fibrosis}} or thalassaemia, that <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> <b>would</b> also be appropriate targets of research. Thus, effects of gene editing on disease mutations could be pursued ethically.|$|R
5|$|Pyroclastic {{flows from}} an {{eruption}} <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> much wildlife about the volcano. Gareloi has historically produced several pyroclastic flows, which can travel extremely fast. Future flows at Gareloi Volcano could travel {{off the island}} into the Pacific Ocean and, if large enough, could fall into the ocean and generate tsunamis, though unlikely.|$|E
5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, {{such as the}} shooting of ten well-known residents of Trøndelag and its environs in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
50|$|In First Nephi, Nephi's father Lehi prophesied that Jerusalem <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> by the Babylonians.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and bribery. The two men were so protective of their digging sites that they <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> smaller or damaged fossils {{to prevent them from}} falling into their rival's hands, or fill in their excavations with dirt and rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction. On one occasion the scientists' rival teams fought each other by throwing stones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{producers}} were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top ten while airing on Sunday, and they felt the move <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> its ratings. Ratings wise, new episodes of The Cosby Show beat The Simpsons every time during the second season and The Simpsons eventually fell out of the top ten. At {{the end of the season}} Cosby averaged as the fifth highest rated show on television, while The Simpsons was thirty eighth.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 23 April 1942, a small raid was made against Exeter, {{followed}} the next day by a pronouncement by Gustaf Braun von Stumm that they <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> every location found in the Baedeker tourist guides that was awarded three stars. Raids of ever-increasing size followed over the next week, in what became known in the UK as the Baedeker Blitz. This first series of raids ended in early May. When Cologne was greatly damaged during the first 1,000-bomber raid, the Luftwaffe returned for another week of raids between 31 May to 6 June.|$|E
5|$|Shiva– The main {{character}} in the story. He is a Tibetan immigrant to Meluha and {{the chief of the}} Guna tribe. On arriving in Meluha and consuming the Somras (a potion), his throat turns blue making him the Neelkanth of the Meluhan legend, which speaks of the appearance of Neelkanth as a destroyer of evil. The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their saviour. Shiva searches for the source of Evil, and deciding that it is Somras which <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> India, he declares war to eradicate the drink completely. His deeds and accomplishments in saving India from its dangers makes him the Mahadev (Great God).|$|E
50|$|After his death, {{a statue}} {{was built in}} Renault's memory which later <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> by the German attacks during World War II.|$|R

5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana says: When Ravana {{wants to}} marry Mandodari, Maya warns him that her {{horoscope}} indicated her first-born <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> her clan and should be killed. Ignoring Maya's advice, Ravana buries his first child by Mandodari in a casket in Janaka’s city, where it is discovered and grew up as Sita. Jain adaptations of the Ramayana like Vasudevahindi, Uttara-purana, and others also state that Sita {{is the daughter of}} Ravana and Mandodari, and is abandoned when she is prophesied to be the cause of the end of Ravana and his family.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons {{timeslots}} {{in hopes that}} it would result in higher ratings for the lead out shows. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> its ratings.|$|E
5|$|The {{surfaces}} {{should be}} broad and simple, {{defined by a}} bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{religious}} overtones similar to Swift's sermons, {{such as the}} Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul. However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> the Irish economy and {{the souls of the}} citizenry.|$|E
5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in assessing the impact their actions will have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E
5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles <b>would</b> <b>destroy</b> its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E

50|$|During Minuteman's early development, the Air Force {{maintained}} {{the policy that}} the manned strategic bomber was the primary weapon of nuclear war. Blind bombing accuracy {{on the order of}} 1500 feet km was expected, and the weapons were sized to ensure even the hardest targets <b>would</b> be <b>destroyed</b> as long as the weapon fell within this range. The USAF had enough bombers to attack every military and industrial target in the USSR and was confident that its bombers would survive in great enough numbers that such a strike <b>would</b> utterly <b>destroy</b> the country.|$|R
