25|$|Clubs vs. holiday centres: {{organizations}} with different roots {{find it difficult}} to establish common rules.

25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the {{equilibrium}} wage, minimum wage laws should cause unemployment. This is because {{a greater number of}} people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller number of jobs <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>at</b> the higher wage. Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. An imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market, as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage, whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment.|$|E

25|$|A turbine-powered aircraft's takeoff {{procedure}} is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This {{is done by}} planning the takeoff around three critical V speeds, V1, VR and V2. V1 is the critical engine failure recognition speed, {{the speed at which}} a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed {{in the event of a}} rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed. The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>at</b> all times.|$|E

The tour was scheduled to kick off on May 5, 2016 and was slated to conclude on June 18, 2016. On April 8, 2016 ICP released their tour dates for their Canada tour. The tour was scheduled to kick off on June 25, 2016 and to conclude on July 17, 2016, {{just in time for}} the GOTJ, which was to start on July 20, 2016. In an early April 2016 Faygoluvers.net interview with Violent J, J said that the possible acts being talked about for Riddle Box Tour are: Esham, Project Born, The Dayton Family, and Young Wicked. Also stated was that he and Shaggy are working on their solo albums. In the same interview it was announced that Young Wicked has a new project revolving around him coming out soon. On April 25, 2016 via Twitter, Young Wicked announced that he is on the 20th Anniversary: Riddle Box Tour. It was also announced via The 17th annual Gathering of the Juggalos infomercial that the label has a new artist that they will be announcing at Gathering 17 along with a new six-song EP from this new [...] "discovery" [...] that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>at</b> the event. Also it was stated that many people will find out what group they used to rap with and who they used to go by. ICP will go on their first Canadian Tour for the first time in 13 years. The tour is scheduled to kick off on June 24, 2016 at the Canadian Rockfest, and concluded on July 17, 2016. During Insane Clown Posse's GOTJ 2016 seminar it was announced that Shaggy 2 Dope will make his wrestling return on August 2, 2016 at the Pro Wrestling Syndicate show in New Jersey. Also announced was that work on the third film in the Big Money film series titled Big Money Thru$ta$ had begun, and with no definite release date, Violent J said [...] "maybe in the next 2 years". It was also stated that a new The Killjoy Club album may be out in November 2016. With Juicy J reuniting with DJ Paul and Crunchy Black to reform Three 6 Mafia it is unknown if he will join The Killjoy Club. The second leg of Insane Clown Posse's [...] "20th Anniversary: Riddle Box Tour" [...] will feature sets from Anybody Killa, Big Hoodoo and Blahzay Roze. [...] "Juggalo Day Show 2017" [...] will take place in Florida and will feature sets from Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Dark Lotus will perform the Tales from the Lotus Pod album in its entirety. The [...] "Canadian Juggalo Day Show 2017" [...] will take place on March 17, 2017 and will feature performances from the entire Psychopathic Records roster as well as performances from Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie. Also it was announced that the 2017 Gathering of the Juggalos will take place in Denver, Colorado, and there is a possibility of a Soopa Villainz reunion. Also a documentary on former Insane Clown Posse member and Shaggy 2 Dope's older brother John Kickjazz, and another documentary on Axe Murder Boyz member Young Wicked will be out in 2017. Shaggy 2 Dope's upcoming album F.T.F.O.M.F. is now scheduled to be released in 2017. Finally it was announced that on September 17, 2017 there will be a [...] "Juggalo March On Washington" [...] in Washington DC and will be a 2-day event which will begin at Lincoln Memorial and will end at Washington Monument with speeches. The only confirmed artists so far is the roster from Psychopathic Records; however, any artists that has performed at the Gathering or is associated with the juggalos or whomever truly supports the family, should attend as well to support the movement. In the November 17, 2016 edition of the hatchet herald it was announced that Psychopathic Records new in-house engineer is Native World Inc.'s own artist Str8Jaket, and he is currently working with the new artist on the label. In late November 2016 it was said that a new Psychopathic Psypher titled If We Were A Gang would be released on January 1, 2017 with an accompanying music video. It was also stated that with the speculation of who is on or not on Psychopathic Records, the Psypher will feature all artists currently on the label. Also a website for the Juggalo March On Washington will be up on January 1, 2017. On the December 22, 2016 edition of Psychopathic Radio, Violent J stated that over 200 acts have been invited to the March. He also stated that on the website you can view each invite (each invite was created specifically for each individual artist) and if the artist accepts (a yellow diamond will appear) or if the artist declines (a red x will appear). Violent J also stated that for each artist that accepts they will be sent an audio clip and will record a 16 bar verse, and then will record it and shoot a video for their verse, for a special cypher that will be released aside from If We Were A Gang. On December 31, 2016 at 3:00pm EST it was announced that Young Wicked of Axe Murder Boyz has left Psychopathic Records and has signed with Majik Ninja Entertainment.|$|E
60|$|The newly offered {{grant of}} Government land has, as yet, been {{accepted}} {{only in a}} few cases. 'It {{was not to be}} expected,' says the report, 'that the Indian, whose habits have been fixed in special grooves for tens of centuries, should hurriedly embrace an offer which must strike at all his prejudices of country, and creed, and kin.' Still, about sixty had settled in 1869 near the estates in Savonetta, where I saw them, and at Point a Pierre; other settlements have been made since, of which more hereafter. And, as a significant fact, many Coolies who have returned to India are now coming back a second time to Trinidad, bringing their kinsfolk and fellow-villagers with them, to a land where violence is unknown, and famine impossible. Moreover, numerous Coolies from the French Islands are now immigrating, and buying land. These are chiefly Madrassees, who are, it is said, stronger and healthier than the Calcutta Coolies. In any case, there seems good hope that a race of Hindoo peasant-proprietors will spring up in the colony, whose voluntary labour <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>at</b> crop-time; and who will teach the Negro thrift and industry, not only by their example, but by competing against him in the till lately understocked labour-market.|$|E
