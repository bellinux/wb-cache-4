25|$|June 12.— After we had dined with Mr. Pageatt, {{where we}} had a neat dinner and strawberries, longest that I have seen, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> house called Dole-hoof, where we saw the {{pictures}} made in wax most liveyly...|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought {{out the best in}} Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

"It was {{so crowded}} {{that there was}} even no way of {{entering}} it. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> canteen {{to have something to}} eat, when there was suddenly a big blast. Everyone panicked, running to all directions. Many of them were blocked at the gate of the park. Dead bodies can be found everywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{continued}} {{to pay the}} annual tribute to Virginia's governor. This consists of game, usually a deer, and pottery or a [...] "peace pipe". The Pamunkey have been paying such tribute since the treaty of 1646. Making this annual payment {{has not always been}} easy. Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. My dad was chief then, and we knew we had to have something to present to the governor; so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it. That way we were able to fulfill the terms of the treaty--after all it was killed on the reservation." [...] As far as anyone knows, they have not missed a payment in 331 years.|$|E
2500|$|Following their {{breakthrough}} 1997 album King of Fools, Delirious? started recording Mezzamorphis in February 1998, {{and continued}} to record throughout that year, interspersed with summer tours throughout the US and UK. The band began recording with roughly half the songs already written, and continued writing as they recorded. Most of the recording took place in an old school in West Sussex. In the words of lead vocalist Martin Smith, [...] "We turned a classroom into a control room, {{and there were some}} wooden rooms where students used to dine, in which we set up a drum kit with different mike positions. We did the bulk of it there {{for the first six months}} in between touring. In the end, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> smaller studio in Ford just to finish it off." [...] The band used movable drapes to experiment with different drum sounds and reverbs; most of the drums on the album are thus natural and unprocessed.|$|E
60|$|WANDA. He {{never let}} people think I {{was married to}} him. I don't know if I was--really. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> office and signed our names; {{but he was a}} wicked man. He treated many, I think, like me.|$|R
50|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new world. A {{world where}} the Dark Hunters live. The Shadowed One is making plans <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> Metru Nui because {{of the death of}} Nidhiki and Krekka. He leaves Lariska in charge of the island.|$|R
6000|$|It was 10 o'clock A.M. {{when we got}} in Chicago, {{too late}} for the steamer; so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} public house, the [...] "American Temperance," [...] and I spent the time that day and till next morning, looking around Chicago.|$|R
2500|$|Auctioneer's description: Fine and {{extensive}} journal of Sir Henry Martin of Harley Street, London, chronicling {{his visit to}} the West Indies between 1836 and 1837, a detailed manuscript journal, closely written on 271 pages, with one pencil sketch showing a group of carts crossing a bridge, bound in marbled boards, 8vo A highly important account by a high status visitor to the West Indies at a very early date. Martin appears to be a very meticulous individual, with an eye for minute detail throughout his journey in every degree, making this an invaluable record not only of the West Indies, but also the general conditions in every place he visited, including the U.K. For example, he leaves Piccadilly in December 1836 via the Herald Coach to Falmouth noting, [...] "Passage money inside £4:5:0, outside £2:5:0 - I had three enquiries made at the coach office on different days to ascertain the exact time that the coach got into Falmouth for the purpose of ordering dinner or not ...". He then notes in great detail the time taken to reach Falmouth. He leaves Piccadilly at 9.47am, reaching Bagshot at 53 minutes past noon, for example. He and his family (with servant) leave Falmouth on board the Mutine, the passage for all costing £38. On board are a group of Cornish miners going to Cuba on a mining scheme. During the journey, he logs latitudes and longitudes for the entire passage, and details the day to day happenings on the vessel. The family reach the West Indies the following February and the journal is equally detailed about the topography and general social conditions which Martin observes. For example, he says of Martinique, [...] "There are here many excellent shops, which would not disgrace Paris, and many private houses three storeys high and from four to six windows in line, chiefly I think built of stone ... <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hotel (as it's called) kept by a mulatto woman called Parker, a native of Barbados and well known to all naval persons who have been here of late years - I think she must be nearly 60 but she looks very much younger. She is quite a character and a very shrewd one too ...". This is an invaluable insight into the early 19th century, which deserves considerable research.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hotel by the sea, {{where two}} gentlemen were smoking cigars {{in a room}} by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four chairs, and had a large rough jacket on. In a corner was a heap of coats and boat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.|$|R

60|$|After dining <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{roof-garden}} vaudeville {{that was}} being much praised. There we found a good bill, an artificially cooled atmosphere, cold drinks, prompt service, and a gay, well-dressed audience. North was bored.|$|E
6000|$|But Fulk's answer, was--"Better so! If <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strange place, {{and tried}} to conceal it, it would always be oozing out, and be {{supposed}} disgraceful. If my sisters can bear it, I had rather confront it straightforwardly--" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I havent {{been totally}} {{satisfied}} with any hotel Ive stayed in," [...] said John Denton. [...] "We {{spend a lot}} of time looking for the best but if we find small, good quality hotels, they dont have a late-night bar or a good restaurant. If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large hotel for the nightlife, then its not the sort of place we like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will send}} for a paper and see," [...] the Baroness said. [...] "We cannot sit {{and look at}} one another all the evening. With music one can make dinner last out till nine or even half past--an idea, my Louise!" [...] she exclaimed suddenly. [...] "Cannot <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> music-hall, the Alhambra, for example? We could take a box and sit back." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{paid for}} what we had drunk, and {{we made our way}} to a cheap restaurant, crowded and gay, where we dined with pleasure. I had the {{appetite}} of youth and he of a hardened conscience. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tavern to have coffee and liqueurs.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} mamma {{planned to take}} the four o'clock car back to [...] Hartford. We rose quite early that morning {{and went to the}} Vienna [...] Bakery and took breakfast there.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that will}} be best," [...] said Milray. [...] "But I shall give you a letter to my sister. She and I used to be famous cronies, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> great many parties {{together}} {{when we were young}} people. We thought the world was a fine thing, then. But it changes." ...|$|E
60|$|Dody Wardwell thought <b>we</b> might <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shopkeeper who dealt in such goods, and, {{telling the}} story, beg what was needed.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{the three}} merchants sing {{has had a}} lyrics change. The lyric [...] "We never, never fail when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> sale, <b>we</b> simply cheat a little if we must" [...] was changed to [...] "We never, never fail when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> sale, <b>we</b> work a little harder if we must." [...] The reason for these edits is not known; but it {{may have to do}} with the merchants being [...] "Jewish" [...] stereotypes.|$|R
60|$|After Leo Vincey and I {{came back}} from Africa in 1885, {{desiring}} solitude, which indeed we needed sorely {{to recover from the}} fearful shock we had experienced, and to give us time and opportunity <b>to</b> think, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> old house upon the shores of Cumberland that has belonged to my family for many generations. This house, unless somebody has taken it believing me to be dead, is still my property and thither I travel to die.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} day, {{which was}} Wednesday, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> solicitor, {{and laid the}} case before him, and he instituted inquiries among all the lodging- house keepers in Scarborough, {{with the result that}} on Thursday afternoon McQuae was restored (after the manner of an Adelphi hero in the last act) to his home and wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "At a {{shop where}} they sold souvenirs," [...] Lister replied. [...] "I didn't expect to meet her; I {{went in to}} buy some {{enameled}} things. It {{was a pretty good}} shop and the hotel clerk declared the people were all right. She knew me and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tea-room. She left me at the door, and I think that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear girl," [...] he laughed, [...] "what {{was there}} to fear for me? I {{had a very good}} dinner with a very charming man. Afterwards, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> music-hall for a short time, I went back to his rooms, and here I am, just in time to wish you good night. What could the voices have to tell you about that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Forester, [...] "it is time <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> dinner now; but we'll {{come and}} see the boat the next time <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> take <b>a</b> walk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... § 3. If, therefore, when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place, <b>we</b> {{see nothing}} else than is there, {{we are to}} paint nothing else, and to remain pure {{topographical}} or historical landscape painters. If, going to the place, we see something quite different from what is there, then we are to paint that--nay, we must paint that, whether we will or not; it being, for us, the only reality we can get at. But let us beware of pretending to see this unreality if we do not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dishonesty is not {{the general}} fault of the critics, Lady Carbury,--at least not as far as I have {{observed}} the business. It is incapacity. In what little I {{have done in the}} matter, that is the sin which I have striven to conquer. When we want shoes <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> professed shoemaker; but for criticism we have certainly not <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> professed critics. I think that when I gave up the [...] "Evening Pulpit," [...] I left upon it a staff of writers who are entitled to be regarded as knowing their business.' ...|$|R
