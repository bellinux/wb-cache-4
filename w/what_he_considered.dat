5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{propagated}} {{the principles}} of rationalism, self-respect, women’s rights and eradication of caste. He opposed the exploitation and marginalisation of the non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India and the imposition of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> Indo-Aryan India.|$|E
5|$|Camet, therefore, won {{the bronze}} {{medal in the}} team foil category, along with his teammates, despite <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be adverse rulings from the jurors. This was the first and, {{at the time of}} Camet's death, only Olympic medal for Argentina in fencing. It was also the only bronze medal won by the Argentine {{delegation}} in Amsterdam, although silver medals were won by Raúl Landini, Víctor Peralta and the football team, along with gold medals from Víctor Avendaño, Arturo Rodríguez and Alberto Zorrilla.|$|E
5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E

He wrote about alternative Norwegian policies towards South Africa in the 1985 book Syd-Afrika i dag: Boikott eller samarbeid. These books were published by Afrikainstituttet, {{of which he}} was board chairman from 1983 to 1990. In 1994, he chronicled the trials against Arne Myrdal in Myrdal-sakene. Gjems-Onstad has in addition released his own periodical, Nytt og kommentarer.|$|E
5|$|Magnus had a son, Haakon Toresfostre, who was {{probably}} born {{the same year}} that Magnus died. Haakon went on to claim <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> his part of the kingdom (after his father) in 1093 when his uncle Olaf Kyrre died, and shared the kingdom with his cousin Magnus Barefoot (son of Olaf Kyrre). Similar to the reign of his father, Haakon's reign also ended abruptly after a short time as he died young in 1095.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{frequently}} {{received attention}} in the 1980s and 1990s due to his atheism activism. He filed lawsuits against numerous American municipalities, against the Boy Scouts of America in 1997, and against Township High School District 214 in 2007 for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> unconstitutional endorsements of religion. He was involved in numerous other lawsuits, of which {{at least one other}} went to the Supreme Court in the late 2000s. After 10 years of membership in American Atheists, he formed his own organization, Rob Sherman Advocacy.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{was known}} for his direct {{approach}} to game journalism and scathing criticism of the video game industry. During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile and stepped out of its sister publication's shadow, but Smith grew frustrated with the contemporary state of gaming news and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting promotional material as news. In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co-host of the developer's podcast.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} central Vietnam, Đính {{enlisted in the}} Vietnamese National Army (VNA) of the French-backed State of Vietnam at Phu Bai in 1949 and trained as a paratrooper in France. He became a protege of Ngô Đình Cẩn, a younger brother of Prime Minister Diệm. Cần, who unofficially {{controlled}} the region of central Vietnam near Huế, was impressed by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be an abundance of courage {{on the part of}} Đính. Within six years of enlisting in the military, Đính had risen to the rank of colonel and was made the inaugural commander of the newly formed 32nd Division based in Da Nang in the centre of the country on 1 January 1955. Đính led the unit until November 1956, during which time it was renamed the 2nd Division.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing his}} reelection bid in 1861, Stevenson, a known Confederate sympathizer, {{stayed out of}} public life {{during the war and}} was {{consequently}} able to avoid being imprisoned, as many other Confederate sympathizers were. In 1867, just five days after John L. Helm and Stevenson were elected governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, Helm died and Stevenson became acting governor. Stevenson subsequently won a special election in 1868 to finish Helm's term. As governor, he opposed federal intervention in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> state matters but insisted that blacks' newly granted rights be observed and used the state militia to quell post-war violence in the state. Although a fiscal conservative, he advocated a new tax to benefit education and created the state bureau of education.|$|E

5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be an objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe {{in an attempt to}} stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E
5|$|After {{working and}} {{training}} in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, {{but for most of}} his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings' intended functions. After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He {{was a member of the}} Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be an unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his {{being one of the}} first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|At West Point, {{he was an}} {{energetic}} and ambitious cadet, deeply interested in the teachings of Dennis Hart Mahan and the theoretical strategic principles of Antoine-Henri Jomini. His closest friends were aristocratic Southerners such as James Stuart, Dabney Maury, Cadmus Wilcox, and A. P. Hill. These associations gave McClellan <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be {{an appreciation of the}} Southern mind and an understanding of the political and military implications of the sectional differences in the United States that led to the Civil War. He graduated in 1846, second in his class of 59 cadets, losing the top position to Charles Seaforth Stewart only because of poor drawing skills. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.|$|E
5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri to Edward and Katherine Blake, he {{attended}} Central Catholic High School in East St. Louis, {{where he was}} a baseball teammate of Hank Bauer, and graduated in 1943. Blake pitched batting practice for the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1943 World Series after his high school graduation, in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be the highlight of his professional career. He signed with the Cardinals in 1944 and spent the season with three different minor league teams: the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association, the Allentown Cardinals of the Interstate League and the Mobile Bears of the Southern Association.|$|E
5|$|But {{the emperor}} {{rejected}} an outright invasion. Just {{coming off a}} disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain had disliked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be {{an overly}} sentimental {{attitude}} of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had {{worked closely with the}} President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman over the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal, which an angry Runciman declined. Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942 Puttick was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general, the first New Zealand-born soldier to reach this rank. In the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). As the war progressed he was faced with the difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East and the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre. Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy to deal with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it be used against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, William McGregor {{wrote to}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> {{to be the}} top five English teams, {{including}} Albion, informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season. Thus when the Football League started later that year, Albion {{became one of the}} twelve founder members. Albion's second FA Cup success came in 1892, beating Aston Villa 3–0. They met Villa again in the 1895 final, but lost 1–0. The team suffered relegation to Division Two in 1900–01, their first season at The Hawthorns. They were promoted as champions the following season but relegated again in 1903–04. The club won the Division Two championship once more in 1910–11, and the following season reached another FA Cup Final, where they were defeated by Second Division Barnsley in a replay.|$|E
