5|$|The <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East {{ended on}} 31 October 1918, {{following}} {{the signing of}} the Armistice of Moudros. In November the regiment was selected {{to be part of the}} Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula. They would again be going in a dismounted role, but only twenty-five officers and 464 other ranks were involved. Leaving Egypt on 28 November they disembarked on 5 December and moved into their camps at Maidos and Kilid Bahr. On 19 January 1919, the majority of the regiment returned to Egypt, rejoining the brigade at Kantara.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{overwhelming}} British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to {{change the course of}} history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca attend a {{political}} {{meeting between the}} Kingdom of Guardia and Porre. An assassin attacks; the party pursues him to the Denadoro Mts., where Lucca's prototype Time Egg backfires and sends them to the future. They find Belthasar there, who has established a research facility called Chronopolis. He warns of a new threat to the timeline, and sends the party to the Ocean Palace ruins of 11,995B.C. to investigate. They find Magus, still searching for Schala and feuding with Dalton. They confront a mysterious villain who resurrects Schala and robs the early Masamune, still embedded in the husk of the Mammon Machine. Its theft changes history, causing the Mystics' <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages to drag on another 50years, led by the illusionist Kasmir. The party retrieve Frog (named Glenn in Crimson Echoes) from 605A.D. and meet with Belthasar.|$|E

50|$|He {{advocated}} for a streamlined tax code, and modest reforms to strengthen {{social security and}} medicare that would include incentives for a volunteer corps program tied to benefits.

He advocated for increased investment in domestic renewable energy production and critical transportation infrastructure, and incentives to stimulate U.S. manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|With the Ottoman Empire {{forces in}} retreat, the {{regiment}} {{was part of}} the pursuit into Palestine, resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1917, and raid across the River Jordan, at Amman and Es Salt.

25|$|The British Empire was {{severely}} {{weakened by the}} <b>war.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East, the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil.

Although Labour Party conferences had for years called {{for the establishment of}} a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour government now decided to maintain the 1939 White Paper policies.|$|E
25|$|Degas painted Interior at a {{time when}} his growing {{commitment}} to Realism had led him away from his earlier preoccupation with historical subjects such as Sémiramis Building Babylon (1860–62), Young Spartans Exercising (ca.1860), and the painting which marked his Salon debut, Scene of <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages (1865). His new direction was apparent by the time he exhibited Steeplechase—The Fallen Jockey in the Salon of 1866. Degas probably intended to submit Interior for exhibition in the Salon of 1869, but it was not shown publicly until June 1905, when it was displayed at Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris.|$|E
40|$|Al Jazeera’s {{coverage}} of <b>the</b> United States’ <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East was controversial and attracted American accusations of propaganda.
