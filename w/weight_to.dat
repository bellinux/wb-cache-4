5|$|In 1968, {{the second}} Congress of FRELIMO was a {{propaganda}} {{victory for the}} insurgents, despite attempts by the Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to bomb {{the location of the}} meeting late in the day. This gave FRELIMO further <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> wield in the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the Eskayan speech variety {{has been}} {{associated}} with languages as disparate as Hebrew, Greek, and Etruscan. Recent studies have revealed that the syntax of Eskayan is virtually identical to that of Boholano-Visayan, lending <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> the theory that Eskayan is actually an auxiliary variety of this language.|$|E
5|$|A second auction was held, with {{bids for}} natural gas given equal <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would be obliged to maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency. Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. Its bid of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E

5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> the issue of homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} {{from the}} pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E
5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E

30|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to improve the detection performance of cascade classifiers by assigning larger <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> positive samples. Most of these studies assumed that AdaBoost has a faulty weight update and modified it <b>to</b> assign larger <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> positive samples. These works improved detection performance for face detection; however, they failed <b>to</b> provide the <b>weight</b> values <b>to</b> be assigned to the positive samples.|$|R

5|$|Coins of Ezana {{without any}} symbol at all {{have also been}} found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas. These may reflect a {{transition}} in the religion in Aksum when Frumentius was influencing Ezana's father and gathering Christians in the country, giving <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> the writings of Rufinus. The lack of symbol altogether may reflect an uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in religion of the Aksumite state.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|During her {{sophomore year}} of high school, after Wilson's {{interest}} in modeling grew more serious, her mother urged her to pursue it.

In the process of losing weight, she began a bout with anorexia nervosa and then bulimia that lasted from ages 14-to-20.|$|E

5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> be about 72.0.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E

5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
5|$|Japanese carrier {{doctrine}} {{preferred the}} launching of fully constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire. In addition, the arrival of another land-based American air strike at 07:53 gave <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> the need to attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E

Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction.

5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow tried to attack Tatanka before the bell, but Tatanka moved. The two fought back and forth, and Bigelow gained momentum after Tatanka missed a crossbody {{from the top}} turnbuckle. Bigelow used his <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> keep the advantage, sitting on Tatanka and later using a bear hug to wear him down. After the two hit each other with simultaneous crossbodies, Tatanka began a war dance.
