25|$|On 27 February 1985 Doctor Who {{was placed}} on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC {{originally}} planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade {{was the target of}} death threats) but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration, making it impossible to find anyone (at the time) <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to do with the series.|$|E

500|$|According to a Scientology publication, Moxon {{utilized}} Scientology doctrine {{to bring}} about the demise of the Cult Awareness Network. The publication, authored by Scientology official Kurt Weiland, stated: [...] "A civil case was filed by the victim against [...] Ross and the Cult Awareness Network. This time he had an attorney <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he was doing and understood PTS/SP tech! The attorney was a Scientologist and OT [...] Rick Moxon." [...] "PTS/SP tech" [...] is Scientology terminology referring to the organization's founder L. Ron Hubbard's prescribed tactics of handling enemies called [...] "suppressive persons" [...] (SPs) and their associates, called [...] "potential trouble sources" [...] (PTSs). The Cult Awareness Network was seen by Scientology as a [...] "SP" [...] organization.|$|E

500|$|Originally to {{be called}} The Ends of the Earth, each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a {{different}} way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{was going to happen}} to Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a [...] "roving reporter" [...] for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide. Recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke of the idea of [...] "hitchhiking around the galaxy" [...] while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E
500|$|Milk's and Moscone's {{murders and}} White's trial changed city {{politics}} and the California legal system. In 1980 San Francisco ended district supervisor elections, fearing that a Board of Supervisors so divisive would be harmful to the city, {{and that they had}} been a factor in the assassinations. A grassroots neighborhood effort to restore district elections in the mid-1990s proved successful, and the city returned to neighborhood representatives in 2000. As a result of Dan White's trial, California voters changed the law to reduce the likelihood of acquittals of accused <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they were doing but claimed their capacity was impaired. Diminished capacity was abolished as a defense to a charge, but courts allowed evidence of it when deciding whether to incarcerate, commit, or otherwise punish a convicted defendant. The [...] "Twinkie defense" [...] has entered American mythology, popularly described as a case where a murderer escapes justice because he binged on junk food, simplifying White's lack of political savvy, his relationships with George Moscone and Harvey Milk, and what San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen described as pandemic police [...] "dislike of homosexuals".|$|E

For instance, they knew that sound up there wouldn't travel, and {{it would just be}} quiet up there. But then we wouldn't have a series, so we couldn't do that.

2500|$|During {{a trip to}} Europe in 1956 {{with her}} {{children}} Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli. [...] The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll {{was based on a}} popular character appearing in a comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper Bild. Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.|$|E
2500|$|Asher {{turned out}} to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any {{producer}} she had worked with previously. Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio. Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a [...] "woman of strong opinions (<b>who)</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she wanted to do (with her career)", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer, and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. [...] "It must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someone's career when it's someone you sleep with", he said.|$|E

2500|$|Winthrop {{questioned}} Hutchinson {{heavily on}} her association {{with those who}} had caused trouble in the colony, and on the meetings that she held at her house, but Hutchinson effectively stonewalled this prosecutorial thrust by answering questions with questions and matching scripture with scripture. [...] Dudley then stepped in and confronted her concerning having men at her home meetings and [...] "traducing [...] the ministers" [...] by saying that they [...] "preached a covenant of works, and only Mr. Cotton a covenant of grace." [...] To the latter charge Dudley added, [...] "you {{said they were not}} able ministers of the new testament, but Mr. Cotton only!" [...] This last assertion brought pause to Hutchinson, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she had said and to whom she had said it. According to the modern interpretations of Emery Battis, she had assumed that her statements would be confidential and private when she made them during the meetings with the ministers in October 1636.|$|E
2500|$|Retrospective {{reviews from}} critics {{have been more}} negative. In May 2014, WatchMojo placed the episode at number one on their list of the most disappointing TV show finales, calling it [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "perturbingly messy" [...] with [...] "so many {{unanswered}} questions". Six months later, Chris E. Hayner of Zap2It similarly named [...] "The End" [...] as the number one worst series finale, calling it [...] "the king of disappointing series finales". Indiewire also branded the finale as the number one worst ever, criticizing it for being [...] "unbelievably long" [...] and having a [...] "decided lack of dramatic tension and any real thrills". Discussing the final season as a whole, Indiewire described season six as [...] "directionless" [...] and [...] "largely a 'miss. Writing for MTV in 2015, Josh Wigler called the episode [...] "the finale that sucks", and {{said that it would}} live on [...] "as the model for how NOT to finish your show". Daniel D'Addario, writing for Salon.com, listed [...] "The End" [...] as one of the [...] "worst finales ever", describing the series as [...] "a show whose twists and turns didn't always seem to be undertaken by people <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they were doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{car bombs}} detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street, at 5.28 p.m., 5.30 p.m. and 5.32 p.m. respectively. No {{warnings}} had been given. According to military experts, {{the placement of}} the car bombs indicated [...] "highly-intelligent military planning by people <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they were doing". One of the Irish Army's top bomb disposal officers, Commandant Patrick Trears, declared that the bombs were constructed so well that one hundred per cent of each bomb exploded upon detonation, resulting in the deaths of 26 people, mostly women (including one who was nine-months pregnant). Most of the dead were blasted beyond recognition; one girl who had been near the epicentre of the Talbot Street explosion was decapitated and only her platform boots provided a clue as to her sex. Close to 300 people were injured, many maimed for life. After the blasts the bombers fled from central Dublin in the scout cars and headed back north using the [...] "smuggler's route" [...] of minor and back roads, crossing the Northern Ireland border near Hackballs Cross, County Louth at about 7.30 p.m. Thirty minutes earlier, a fourth car bomb, delivered by a team from the Mid-Ulster UVF's Portadown unit, had exploded in Monaghan, killing an additional seven people. Samuel Whitten was allegedly the driver of the car.|$|E
