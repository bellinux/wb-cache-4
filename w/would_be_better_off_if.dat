25|$|With Nanda, Indjejikian {{argues that}} {{incentive}} problems are a crucial aspect of responsibility accounting. Due to the Ratchet effect, the employer <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> both parties {{can agree on}} a multi-period contract without subsequent revisions. Two responsibility center structures are analyzed: Consolidated structures are produced when managers are attributed to multiple activities. These structures imply less ratcheting but {{at the loss of}} comparative performance information. Specialized structures mean managers are responsible for one activity thus providing a higher level of comparative performance information but also a higher level of ratcheting. Performance evaluation in firms with specialized structures is more informative because of the use of comparative measurements.|$|E
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E

Notwithstanding claims that the world <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> most adopted a single common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus {{that the loss of}} languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel in the Old Testament, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict, but this is contradicted by {{the fact that many of}} the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.|$|E

500|$|Academic Eliot A. Cohen, {{professor}} of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University wrote for The Washington Post that the British Army had [...] "a higher quotient of sophisticated {{leaders who have}} thought hard about the profession of arms" [...] than was found in other armed forces, including the US military, which he believed explained why it [...] "produces generals who write [...] serious, important books" [...] such as the Utility of Force. Cohen wrote that Smith's thesis, {{that the world has}} entered a new era of conflict, is of [...] "central importance" [...] for the United States military, which Cohen believed would have to undergo significant adaptation if Smith was correct. Cohen criticised the book for its limited historical perspective, noting that conventional wars are still fought (for example the Kargil War in 1999) and that several confrontations in Asia threatened to spill over into conventional warfare. Nevertheless, Cohen concluded [...] "Smith has clearly written {{one of the most important}} books on modern warfare in the last decade. We <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> the United States had a few more generals like him".|$|E

However, each player could improve their own situation by breaking the mutual cooperation, no matter how the other player possibly (or certainly) changes their decision.|$|E
2500|$|The US {{government}} also acquired easement {{rights to the}} western part of the territory, which became the Oklahoma Territory, for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> each family owned its own land. The Dawes Act of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve.

2500|$|Past {{comments}} {{came back}} to haunt Goldwater throughout the campaign. He had once called the Eisenhower administration [...] "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party. In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that [...] "sometimes I think this country <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea". That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign {{in the form of}} a Johnson television commercial, as did remarks about making Social Security voluntary, and statements in Tennessee about selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, a large local New Deal employer.|$|E

6000|$|It is on {{this vital}} problem that the entire destiny of the {{labourer}} is ultimately dependent. Many minor interests may sometimes appear to interfere with it, but all branch from it. For instance, considerable agitation is often caused {{in the minds of}} the lower classes when they discover the share which they nominally, and to all appearance, actually, pay out of their wages in taxation (I believe thirty-five or forty per cent.). This sounds very grievous; but in reality the labourer does not pay it, but his employer. If the workman had not to pay it, his wages would be less by just that sum: competition would still reduce them to the lowest rate at which life was possible. Similarly the lower orders agitated for the repeal of the corn laws,[42] thinking they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>if</b> bread were cheaper; never perceiving that as soon as bread was permanently cheaper, wages would permanently fall in precisely that proportion. The corn laws were rightly repealed; not, however, because they directly oppressed the poor, but because they indirectly oppressed them in causing a large quantity of their labour to be consumed unproductively. So also unnecessary taxation oppresses them, through destruction of capital, but the destiny of the poor depends primarily always on this one question of dueness of wages. Their distress (irrespectively of that caused by sloth, minor error, or crime) arises on the grand scale from the two reacting forces of competition and oppression. There is not yet, nor will yet for ages be, any real over-population in the world; but a local over-population, or, more accurately, a degree of population locally unmanageable under existing circumstances for want of forethought and sufficient machinery, necessarily shows itself by pressure of competition; and the taking advantage of this competition by the purchaser to obtain their labour unjustly cheap, consummates at once their suffering and his own; for in this (as I believe in every other kind of slavery) the oppressor suffers at last more than the oppressed, and those magnificent lines of Pope, even in all their force, fall short of the truth-- ...|$|E
