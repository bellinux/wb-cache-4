5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his <b>white</b> <b>collar,</b> the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of Dawn of Sorrow was announced on January 6, 2005 {{as the first}} Castlevania game to be released on the Nintendo DS. Longtime Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi {{was in charge of}} the production. The choice to use the Nintendo DS in favor of the Sony PlayStation Portable was due to Aria of Sorrows success on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and Igarashi's observations during the 2005 E3 Media and Business Summit of both consoles. Igarashi felt that the storyline with Soma Cruz and the Tactical Soul system were a waste to only use in one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel. The original design team from Aria of Sorrow, as well as numerous new additions from Konami Tokyo, was involved in the {{production of}} Dawn of Sorrow. Igarashi intended to include a <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> Japanese worker in the game. This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family as well. However, the development team's opposition to this idea forced him to drop this prospect.|$|E
