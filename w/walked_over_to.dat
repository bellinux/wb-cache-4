5|$|On 16 October 2010, Diarra was {{involved}} in a controversial dispute, which resulted in the player being banned from playing league football for six matches. After receiving a yellow card booking from referee Wilfriend Bien in the team's 1–0 win over Auxerre, Diarra responded by pushing the referee with both hands. He was immediately shown a red card and dismissed from the match. After walking off the field, Diarra turned back, <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Bien and apologized for the confrontation. After the match, Diarra apologized again for the incident. He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple mistake that he immediately regretted as soon as he realized what he did. Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, his suspension was upgraded to six matches. Diarra returned to the team on 27 November playing only the first half in the team's 1–1 draw with Lille.|$|E

25|$|After {{several weeks}} in Ranofotsy Bay, Italian Father Luigi Mariana, with 3 Portuguese sailors {{and quite a}} few of their slaves, <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Trano Vato (near Vinanibe) where he wanted to {{establish}} a chapel and house that he and Father Freire could use as a base for their missionary efforts. They chose this site as they wanted to focus their efforts on King Chambanga and his people. After several weeks of work, having constructed both buildings, a 10m cross was also raised at this site, with another one planted which overlooked Ranofotsy bay.|$|E

25|$|As per tradition, the Sikhs {{gathered}} in the Golden Temple to celebrate the festival of Baisakhi in 1919. After their visit, many <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Jallianwala Bagh next to it to listen to speakers protesting Rowlatt Act and other policies of the colonial British government. A large crowd had gathered, when the British general Reginald Dyer ordered his soldiers to surround the Jallianwala Bagh, then open fire into the civilian crowd. Hundreds died and thousands were wounded. The massacre strengthened {{the opposition to the}} colonial rule throughout India, and particularly Sikhs. It triggered massive non-violent protests. The protests pressured the British government to transfer the control over the management and treasury of the Golden Temple to an elected organization called Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC). The SGPC continues to manage the Golden Temple.|$|E
25|$|At about 21:40 on {{the evening}} of Saturday of 7 March, four off-duty British {{soldiers}} of the Royal Engineers walked outside the barracks to receive a pizza delivery from two delivery men. As the exchange was taking place, two masked gunmen in a nearby car (a green Vauxhall Cavalier) opened fire with Romanian AKM automatic rifles. The firing lasted for more than 30 seconds with more than 60 shots being fired. After the initial burst of gunfire, the gunmen <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the wounded soldiers lying on the ground and fired again at close range, killing two of them. Those killed were Sappers Mark Quinsey from Birmingham and Patrick Azimkar from London. The other two soldiers and two deliverymen were wounded. The soldiers were wearing desert fatigues and were to be deployed to Afghanistan the next day. A few hours later, the car involved was found abandoned near Randalstown, eight miles from the barracks.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E

25|$|The Alabama extremist William Lowndes Yancey's {{demand for}} a federal slave code for the territories split the Democratic Party between North and South, which made the {{election}} of Lincoln possible. Yancey tried to make his {{demand for a}} slave code moderate enough to get Southern support and yet extreme enough to enrage Northerners and split the party. He demanded that the party support a slave code for the territories if later necessary, so that the demand would be conditional enough to win Southern support. His tactic worked, and lower South delegates left the Democratic Convention at Institute Hall in Charleston, South Carolina and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Military Hall. The South Carolina extremist Robert Barnwell Rhett hoped that the lower South would completely break with the Northern Democrats and attend a separate convention at Richmond, Virginia, but lower South delegates gave the national Democrats one last chance at unification {{by going to the}} convention at Baltimore, Maryland before the split became permanent. The end result was that John C. Breckinridge became the candidate of the Southern Democrats, and Stephen Douglas became the candidate of the Northern Democrats.|$|E

With blood {{streaming}} from his hand, Clarke waved it defiantly in front of Lajoie. [...] "Now can I go home?" [...] asked Clarke. He was out five weeks, and Cleveland lost the pennant to Detroit by half a game." ...|$|E

Thorpe, however, convinced Warner to let him try some rushing plays in practice against the school team's defense; Warner assumed he would be tackled easily and give up the idea. Thorpe [...] "ran around past and through them not once, but twice". He then <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Warner and said [...] "Nobody is going to tackle Jim", while flipping him the ball.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer Anthony Kiedis to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] while flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it {{to the rest of the}} band: [...] "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this.'" [...] Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis recalls that they [...] "got up and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier".|$|E
500|$|Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight, Holliday confronted Ike, {{accusing him}} of lying about their {{previous}} conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk {{had been going on for}} a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. Ike sat down to have another drink, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp [...] "You must not think I won't be after you all in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

The owner had been instructed to tell Ryan that his phone was also out of order, and as Ryan walked out of the shop he was tackled by six detectives, dropping a loaded [...]32 revolver that he had been carrying. At the same moment Det. Sgt Fred Krahe thrust a shotgun through the car window and held it at Walker's head, and he was captured without a struggle. Ryan and Walker had been on the run for 19 days.

2500|$|With the March 1907 peasant uprising, N. D. Cocea's {{profile in}} {{political}} journalism was boosted. He is the probable {{source of a}} much circulated canard, taken up by Adevărul, according to which Romanian authorities had killed 11,000 or more peasant insurgents. Cocea himself eventually settled for a death toll of 12,000, claiming that, [...] "had the peasants' bodies been lined {{up and down on}} Calea Victoriei", Romanian King Carol I of Hohenzollern could have <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Dealul Mitropoliei [...] "on a soft rug of peasant flesh".|$|E
