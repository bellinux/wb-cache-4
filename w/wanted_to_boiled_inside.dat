2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, manna is {{described}} twice: once in [...] {{with the full}} narrative surrounding it, and once again in [...] {{as a part of}} a separate narrative. In the description in the Book of Exodus, manna {{is described}} as being [...] "a fine, flake-like thing" [...] like the frost on the ground. It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night. Exodus adds that manna was comparable to hoarfrost in size, similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun, and was like a coriander seed that is white. Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium, adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which were then baked, resulting in something that tasted like cakes baked with oil. Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey. The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna [...] "bred worms and stank": the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered. This manna did not spoil overnight, because, Exodus 16:23-24 states:This is what the Lord commanded: [...] "Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bake and <b>boil</b> what you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil.</b> Save whatever is left and keep it until morning." [...] So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.In the Bread of Life Discourse in John's Gospel, the evangelist refers three times to the manna which the Jews' ancestors ate in the desert: the Jews refer to the manna given to them by Moses as a sign of God's promised covenant, and Jesus asserts that the manna was from God and not from Moses, and that the people who ate it were nourished on their journey but ultimately died. In contrast, according to the gospel, Jesus offered living bread, and whoever ate this bread would never die.|$|R
40|$|In this work, the in&# 64258;uence of an {{external}} alternating magnetic &# 64257;eld on combustion of a ferro&# 64258;uid (liquid with dispersed magnetic nanoparticles) droplet is investigated. The {{response of the}} magnetic nanoparticles to the magnetic &# 64257;eld generates heat inside the droplet, due to magneto relaxation, which acts as a heat source. This phenomenon is produced by friction (viscous dissipation) between rotating nanoparticles and the liquid surrounding them. The rotating motion of the nanoparticles is induced by the magnetic dipole &# 64257;xed on each nanoparticle, which tends to align itself with the magnetic &# 64257;eld. In the absence of magnetic &# 64257;eld, Brownian motion of the liquid molecules is responsible for misaligning the dipoles, after collisions with the nanoparticle surface. Under the in&# 64258;uence of {{an external}} alternating magnetic &# 64257;eld, the process of aligning and misaligning repeats itself in each cycle, producing heat by viscous dissipation, due to a periodically reversing nanoparticle circular motion. Magneto relaxation heating, together with heat transfer from the &# 64258;ame, contribute to droplet heating, hence increasing the vaporization rate of ferro&# 64258;uid droplets. The current analysis considers a magnetic heat source that is much larger than that provided by heat transfer from the &# 64258;ame. Under this condition, {{as in the case}} of semi-transparent droplets absorbing heat from the &# 64258;ame by radiation, a thermal boundary layer is formed in the liquid on the droplet surface. Additionally, under certain conditions the temperature inside the thermal boundary layer can become higher than the temperature at the droplet surface. This leads <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> occurs <b>inside</b> the droplet rather than at the surface, as in classical models. The temperature difference between the thermal boundary layer and the droplet surface results in an extra heat &# 64258;ux to the droplet surface, which increases the vaporization rate.

40|$|Introduction Batch-style water targets {{used for}} F- 18 {{production}} are known <b>to</b> operate under <b>boiling</b> {{conditions in the}} target irradiation chamber, but the distribution of vapor under steady-state conditions was previously unknown. Thermal performance of batch targets has been correlated to average void in the target [1], but the simplified assumptions of such models do not represent the true non-uniform boiling behavior. Visualization targets can be used <b>to</b> observe <b>boiling</b> <b>inside</b> of a target during operation [2 – 5]. Commercial BTI targets operate at 28 – 35 bar (400 – 500 psi) with heat inputs of 0. 5 to 3 kW and fill volumes of 1 to 4 mL. Recently, a visualization target featuring two transparent viewing windows was used <b>to</b> observe <b>boiling</b> conditions for realistic operating beam power, target pressure, and fill volume [4]. The same methodology {{has been applied to}} three additional visualization targets to examine the effect of target geometry on observed boiling phenomena. Material and Methods The original visualization target featured an aluminum body with a 0. 127 mm (0. 005 inch) integral aluminum beam window and two viewing windows made of optically clear sapphire (Al 2 O 3). It was operated on an IBA 18 / 9 cyclotron with 18 MeV protons at beam power up to 1. 1 kW, for pressures of 5 to 21 bar (70 to 300 psi), and a fill volume of 2. 5 mL. All of the new designs featured a wider chamber to allow for higher beam transmission and an increased chamber height, consistent with cur-rent trends in high power targets. One target featured a reduced chamber depth, and another had a ramp {{in the back of the}} chamber to reduce fill volume. Target pressure was limited to a maximum of 14 bar (200 psi) due to the larger diameter beam window. A video camera was used <b>to</b> record the <b>boiling</b> conditions observed for each target under several lighting conditions. During irradiation, the proton beam excites the water molecules, producing visible blue light emissions during de-excitation. These light emissions provide a good indication of beam distribution and penetration depth. A strong backlight can be used to produce clearer images of bubbles generated during boiling. Results and Conclusion Proton range and visible blue light emissions were recorded in dark ambient conditions. The width of the Bragg peak and natural circulation in the bulk fluid were visible with good ambient lighting. Size and distribution of vapor bubbles could be observed by using a strong backlight. The beam current was increased gradually to determine the thermal limit for each target for several fill volumes and pressures. Two thermal limits were observed which resulted in some beam penetration in the top region of the beam. For lower fill volumes, steam ac-cumulates in or around the helium overpressure bubble, causing the helium bubble to move into the upper region of the beam. For higher fill volumes, beam penetration occurs due to excessive voiding, when bubbles produced in the beam region cannot rise quickly enough out of the path of the beam...|$|R

Our aim was to prove that this historical error goes a long way in distorting the gospel message. In chapter three we survey and evaluate the position from a peccability viewpoint while, at the same time, entering and notarising our points of departure. We have there highlighted the arguments peccability theologians utilise to defend their view and have criticised such from our Dispensational theology. In chapter four we then assess and acknowledge the argument for impeccability by proving the necessity of it for the exoneration of His Person and gospel.
