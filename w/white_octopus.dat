40|$|Collagen from muscle of volador (Illex coindetii), pota (Toradopsis eblanae), and <b>white</b> <b>octopus</b> (Eledone cirrhosa) was {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} anatomical location, sex, and maturity. Collagen content was higher in arms than in mantle in all three species; there were also significant differences in octopus depending on {{the age of the}} individual. Concerning sex, the largest differences in the amount of collagen were found in relation to total protein content. In volador and pota, collagen solubility was higher in the mantle than in the arms, {{and in the case of}} pota there were also sex-related differences. In octopus males, solubility was higher in the arms. Two types of collagen, I and V, were identified as the principal constituents in all three species and at both anatomical locations (mantle and arms). The electrophoretic mobility of the α 2 chain differed in the two types of collagen, but the amino acid compositions of the collagen were similar in the mantle and arms in all three species examined.

5000|$|Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, and Scrappy-Doo are {{on their}} way to a Miss Grimwood's Finishing School for Girls, where they have been hired as gym teachers. Once there, however, they find that it is {{actually}} a school for girl ghouls. The pupils include Sibella, the daughter of Count Dracula; Elsa Frankenteen, the daughter of Frankenstein's monster, Winnie, the daughter of The Wolfman; Phantasma (usually called Phanty for short), the daughter of a phantom, possibly The Phantom of the Opera; and Tanis, the daughter of The Mummy - all parodies/tributes to the Universal Monsters of the 1930s-40s. Other residents of the school are a floating <b>white</b> hand; an <b>octopus,</b> who is the school's butler; Legs, a spider that helps with the upcoming volleyball match; Miss Grimwood, the headmistress; and her pet dragon Matches (who dislikes Scooby at first, but later becomes friends, and has a strong friendship with Scrappy). Shaggy and Scooby want no part of this at first, but eventually they agree to stay as teachers.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Otto Octavius is {{introduced}} {{as a scientist}} at OsCorp and secretly a corporate spy for Justin Hammer, Norman Osborn's business rival. He is caught in a lab accident that also turns Norman into the Green Goblin. After this accident, his traditional metal arms are grafted onto his body and {{he is able to}} communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin perishes due to a heart attack caused by Octavius attacking him. Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Osborn, form the Ultimate Six, consisting of some of Spider-Man's rogues gallery. There are only five villains to begin with, but Osborn planned to bring Spider-Man into the group. The five attack S.H.I.E.L.D. and capture an unmasked Spider-Man. They tie him to a chair, and Osborn humiliates Peter by recounting the accident that created him, and he and Otto's involvements. Osborn then blackmails Peter Parker into joining them, threatening Mary Jane Watson's life. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the <b>White</b> House lawn, <b>Octopus</b> is taken down by the Wasp. Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them. Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage. He manages to capture Spider-Man, and he brings him aboard an airplane, ties him to a chair, and unmasks him. From there, he inflicts humiliation and torture on to Peter, mocking him as a teenager, pulling a tooth out, and webbing his mouth. Peter escaped, and defeats Octavius. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Nick Fury melts Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms {{in front of him and}} instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwards to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the Ultimate Hobgoblin story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen.|$|R
