2500|$|Indianapolis {{citizens}} {{also enjoyed}} {{a greater variety}} of entertainments. Theaters and performances of all types were popular among city residents, including minstrel shows, burlesque, variety shows, circuses, operettas, concerts, drama, opera, and other forms of entertainment. Venues varied from amusement parks, concert halls and sporting events to beer gardens and saloons. Top theaters included the Metropolitan (1858, renamed the Park in 1879) and the English Opera House. As {{in other areas of the}} United States, the bicycle craze arrived in Indianapolis in the mid-1890s. During a League of American <b>Wheelman</b> meet in Indianapolis in 1898, African American cyclist Marshall [...] "Major" [...] Taylor competed and won at the city's Newby Oval cycling track.|$|E

2500|$|Midway {{announced}} on May 21, 2009 {{that it had}} received a takeover bid from Warner Bros., valued at more than $33 million, to acquire most of the company's assets, including Midway's Chicago and Seattle studios and rights to the Mortal Kombat and <b>Wheelman</b> series. [...] The offer {{did not include the}} San Diego and Newcastle studios or the TNA video game series. [...] Midway had previously worked with Warner Bros. on several games including Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. [...] Midway {{announced on}} May 28, 2009 that it would [...] "accept binding offers up to June 24, 2009, to acquire {{some or all of the}} Company's assets." [...] An auction was to be held on June 29, followed by a court hearing to approve the sale to the winning bidder or bidders. [...] However, no other bids were placed for Midway's assets, and so the auction was canceled. [...] On July 1, 2009, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of most of the company's assets to Warner Bros. subject to the intellectual property claims of a third party, Threshold Entertainment, which produced two Mortal Kombat films and some other Mortal Kombat entertainment properties.|$|E
2500|$|The stunt {{coordinator}} for the film was Bud Ekins, who was Steve McQueen's stunt double in The Great Escape. He was friends with the film editor, Bud Smith, who recalls Ekins being [...] "as cool as cucumber". In some cases stuntmen were employed throughout {{the making of the}} film but generally speaking the principal actors acted as their own doubles and were actual truck drivers. For instance, since Roy Scheider's character Jackie Scanlon {{was meant to be a}} mob's <b>wheelman,</b> he had to undertake a special preparation for manoeuvering a vintage truck with the purpose of gaining the necessary driving skills. He summarized the experience as [...] "rehearsing to stay alive". Scheider has emphasized that no rear-screen projection or any other kinds of [...] "trick photography" [...] were used, due to the distance between the cameras, the vehicles and the surrounding terrain. In a 1977 interview for The New York Times, Scheider said that shooting Sorcerer [...] "made Jaws look like a picnic." [...] He mentioned that the stuntmen were unhappy because of the fact the leading actors performed their own stunts, and added that the scene involving crossing a suspension rope bridge is [...] "what really happened". Said scene was also, according to him, the most perilous sequence he has ever taken part in. Amidou, in an interview for the Morocco Times in 2005, stated that out of all movies in his oeuvre, Sorcerer left the most lasting impression on him since he [...] "refused to have a substitute and paid for it physically." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was plain}} enough, however, that she {{expected}} me to depart, for she asked me where I proposed to stop {{in the middle of}} the day, and she suggested that she should have a light luncheon put up for me.

60|$|It {{was about}} {{the middle of the}} {{afternoon}} that I found myself bowling along a smooth highway, bordered by trees and stretching itself almost upon a level far away into the distance. Had I been a scorcher, here would have been a chance to do a little record-breaking, for I was a powerful and practised <b>wheelman.</b> But I had no desire to be extravagant with my energies, and so contented myself with rolling steadily on at a speed moderate enough to allow me to observe the country I was passing through.|$|E
60|$|Of course {{where only}} seven men were wanted and {{hundreds}} had begged {{to be allowed}} to go there were numerous disappointments. At last the list was made up of the following--names to be remembered by every patriotic young American: Lieutenant Hobson, in command; O. W. Deignan, helmsman; G. F. Phillips, engineer; F. Kelley, fireman; J. Murphy, coxswain; G. Charette, mine batteries; D. Montague, anchor hand; R. Clausen, extra <b>wheelman.</b> The men were all experienced sailors, and fully realized the extreme peril which awaited them, when they should run the Merrimac in directly under the fire of Morro Castle and the La Zocapa battery.|$|E
5000|$|The Detroit Bicycle Club {{was formed}} in 1879 when [...] "only a few persons in Detroit rode." [...] By 1890, the club merged with the Meteor Bicycle Club and the Star Bicycle Club to become the Detroit <b>Wheelmen.</b> The Unique Cycling Club (1894 to 1911) was the women's {{equivalent}} to the <b>Wheelmen</b> and often shared their clubhouse.|$|R
50|$|The Road Rights and Liabilities of <b>Wheelmen</b> {{written by}} George B. Clementson {{at the height}} of the bicycle's golden age, in 1895, was the first {{treatise}} on bicycle law. In the 1880s and 1890s, the prevailing legal issue cyclists (or <b>wheelmen</b> as they were then called) faced was the question of the right to the road. In a series of seminal right to the road cases, cyclists gained legal rights that form the basis of cyclist's legal rights today. Although bicycle law has developed substantially since 1895, The Road Rights and Liabilities of <b>Wheelmen</b> continues to serve as an outstanding resource for those early right to the road cases.|$|R

6000|$|It {{happened}} {{that on the}} following day, spent in idling in the forest and about the hamlet, conversing with the cottagers, {{we were told that}} our old man {{was a bit of a}} humbug; that he was a great talker, with a hundred schemes for the improvement of his fortunes, and, incidently, for the benefit of his neighbours and the world at large; but nothing came of it all and he was now fast sinking into the lowest depths of poverty. Yet who would blame him? 'Tis the nature of the gorse to be [...] "unprofitably gay." [...] All that, however, is a question for the moralist; the point now is that in walking, even in that poor way, when, on account of physical weakness, it was often a pain and weariness, there are alleviations which may be more to us than positive pleasures, and scenes to delight the eye that are missed by the <b>wheelman</b> in his haste, or but dimly seen or vaguely surmised in passing--green refreshing nooks and crystal streamlets, and shadowy woodland depths with glimpses of a blue sky beyond--all in the wilderness of the human heart.|$|E
6000|$|The Admiral was conquered. This sweet spoken {{creature}} who swallowed his fraudulent history {{as if it}} were the bread of life; basked in his furious blasphemy {{as if it were}} generous sunshine; found only calm, even-handed justice in his rampart partisanship; and flooded him with invented history so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there was no rejecting it, was [...] "too many" [...] for him. He stammered some awkward, profane sentences about the-----Willis and Morgan business having escaped his memory, but that he [...] "remembered it now," [...] and then, under pretence of giving Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough, drew out of the battle and went away, a vanquished man. Then cheers and laughter went up, and Williams, the ship's benefactor was a hero. The news went about the vessel, champagne was ordered, and enthusiastic reception instituted in the smoking room, and everybody flocked thither to shake hands with the conqueror. The <b>wheelman</b> said afterward, that the Admiral stood up behind the pilot house and [...] "ripped and cursed all to himself" [...] till he loosened the smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail.|$|E
60|$|But the {{clothing}} {{store and the}} paper pattern have equalized the cheaper dress of the people {{so that you can}} no longer know citizen and countryman apart by their clothes, still less citizeness and countrywoman; and I can only conjecture that the foreign-looking folk I saw were from New York and Brooklyn. They came by boat, and came and went by the continually arriving and departing trains, and last but not least by bicycles, both sexes. A few came in the public carriages and omnibuses of the neighborhood, but by far the vaster number whom neither the boats nor the trains had brought had their own vehicles, the all-pervading bicycles, which no one seemed so poor as {{not to be able to}} keep. The bicyclers stormed into the frantic village of the beach the whole afternoon, in the proportion of one woman to five men, and most of these must have ridden down on their wheels from the great cities. Boys ran about in the roadway with bunches of brasses, to check the wheels, and put them for safekeeping in what had once been the stable-yards of the hotels; the restaurants had racks for them, where you could see them in solid masses, side by side, for a hundred feet, and no shop was without its door-side rack, which the <b>wheelman</b> might slide his wheel into when he stopped for a soda, a cigar, or a sandwich. All along the road the gay bicycler and bicycless swarmed upon the piazzas of the inns, munching, lunching, while their wheels formed a fantastic decoration for the underpinning of the house and a novel balustering for the steps.|$|E

60|$|As for drunkenness, I {{say again}} that I {{did not see}} much of it, and I heard less, though {{that might have been}} because I did not look or listen in the right places. With that, as with {{everything}} else in London, I took my chance. Once I overheard the unseen transports of a lady in Mayfair imaginably kept by the offices of mutual friends from assaulting another lady. She, however, though she excelled in violence, did not equal in persistence the injured gentleman who for a long, long hour threatened an invisible bicyclist under our windows in that humbler quarter already described as a poor relation of Belgravia. He had apparently been almost run down by the hapless <b>wheelman,</b> who, in a moment of fatuous truth, seemed to have owned that he had not sounded the warning bell. In making this confession he had evidently apologized with his forehead in the dust, and his victim had then evidently forgiven him, though with a severe admonition for the future. Imaginably, then, the bicyclist had remounted his wheel and attempted to ride off, when he was stopped and brought back to the miserable error of his confession. The whole ground was then gone over again, and again pardon with warning was given. Even a glad good-night was exchanged, the wheelman's voice rising in a quaver of grateful affection. Then he seemed to try riding off again, and then he was stayed as before by the victim, whose sense of public duty flamed up at the prospect of his escape. I do not know how the affair ended; perhaps it never ended; but exhausted nature sank in sleep, and I at least was saved from its continuance. I suppose now that the almost injured person was, if not drunk, at that stage of tipsiness when the sensibilities are keenest and self-respect is most alert. An American could not, at least, have been so tedious in his sober senses, and I will not believe that an Englishman could.|$|E
