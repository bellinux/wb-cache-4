40|$|Wage increases, {{along with}} job tenure, {{are one of}} the most robust {{empirical}} regularities found in labor economics. Several theories explain these empirical regularities, and such theories offer clear empirical predictions for the relation ship between productivity-tenure and wage-tenure profiles. The human capital model, with cost and benefit sharing between workers and employers, predicts a steeper productivity-tenure profile than wage-tenure profile. The matching quality model predicts that the two profiles will overlap. Theories that incorporate information asymmetries between employers and employees predict that the wage-tenure profile will be steeper than productivity-tenure profile as an incentive for workers and to enhance efficiency. This paper estimates productivity-tenure and the wage-tenure profiles by estimating plant-level production functions and wage equations using employer-employee matched data from Japan. These estimations offer a comprehensive test for the relative applicability of the two theories on the wage-tenure profile. Estimation results indicate a steeper wage-tenures profile than productivity-tenure profile and point to the relative importance of the deferred <b>wage</b> <b>payment</b> <b>contract.</b> 本論文では， 1993 年から 2003 年について，賃金構造基本統計調査と工業統計調査の事業所データをマッチングして事業所レベルのパネルデータを作成し，年齢に関する生産性プロファイルと賃金プロファイルを同時に推定し，両者の傾きの違いを検証した．これにより労働属性別に労働生産性と賃金率の間の格差を算出した．我々は，日本の製造業では賃金プロファイルの傾きの方が，生産性プロファイルの傾きよりも大きく，従って，若年労働者は生産性以下の報酬を，中高年労働者は生産性以上の報酬を得ているとの結果を得た．我々はまた，この分析結果を利用し，労働者の属性ごとの生産性の違いを，賃金情報ではなく「真」の属性別生産性の情報で捉えることにより，JIP 2006 データベースおよび将来の労働投入予測における労働投入指数，労働の質指数の推計結果がどの程度変化するかを 1970 - 2050 年について，主にマクロレベルで分析した...|$|E

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} (ex post) involuntary unemployment and underemployment {{is explained by}} strategic contracting of firms operating in oligopolistic product markets. Firms {{have an incentive to}} offer labor <b>contracts</b> in which <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> (net of opportunity costs of labor) exceed layoff <b>payments.</b> Such <b>contracts</b> increase marginal costs in bad states, thus relaxing price competition in the product market. In equilibrium, this strategic incentive leads to inefficiently low expected employment, inefficiently high use of other inputs, and inefficient risk bearing by workers relative to the cost minimizing solution. When the product market becomes fragmented, the distortions in the input markets disappear. Copyright 1994 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
40|$|Efficiency wage {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward as attractive ways of explaining {{different aspects of the}} labour market. To find direct evidence of efficiency <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> has proven to be quite difficult. We model various vertical spillovers from wage determination in an upstream labour market to market share performance in a downstream product market and vice versa. We do this within Sutton''s (1991) general oligopoly model under alternative theories of the labour market. Rent sharing due to efficiency wages is shown to create only a downstream vertical spillover. While rent sharing due to wage bargaining creates a two way vertical spillover. The spillovers due to efficiency <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> are shown to be the only downstream spillover that drives a positive relationship between a firm''s wage growth and product market performance. Using U. K. firm level panel data we constrain the data with our theory to pinpoint the downstream spillover due to efficiency <b>wage</b> <b>payments.</b> The spillover turns out to be significant and we claim this to be the first direct and general empirical evidence for efficiency <b>wage</b> <b>payments...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between proxies for extramarginal <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> and subsequent hostile takeover activity, and find little evidence that the takeovers are motivated by the expropriation of extramarginal wages. Then, using data on wage and employment structures {{both before and after}} takeovers, we investigate whether proxies for extramarginal <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> drop after hostile takeovers. The ex post experiments provide evidence consistent with one version of the expropriation hypothesis. Although our findings do not suggest that hostile takeovers reduce workers' shares of rents, such takeovers do appear to reduce extra marginal <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> to more-tenured workers in two ways: first, by reducing employment of more-senior workers; and second, by flattening wage-seniority profiles in firms or establishments with relatively senior work forces.

40|$|The {{period from}} the 1950 s {{to the late}} 1970 s saw an almost uniform decline of cash-to-GDP ratios in {{industrial}} countries.

This change was triggered by rising wages and incomes. Rising wages increased the burden of weekly <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> in cash, and rising incomes made the average earner more interesting for banks. Moreover, regulation and de-regulation, triggering both, price and non-price competition, may also have played a role. Technological change has not been an independent driver. The introduction of cashless <b>wage</b> <b>payments</b> has not only affected the payment behavior but also the savings behaviour of households.
