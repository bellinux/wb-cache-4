For all this show's inanities and love of catchphrases and gaping plot holes where logic should exist, there's clearly something very compelling about Storybrooke and its residents that resonates with viewers. In my own home, it's a decent family watch, that the kids find intriguing and even occasionally scary enough not to be lame, and the adults in the house can still take an interest.

2500|$|Rationalism {{is often}} contrasted with empiricism. Taken very broadly these views are not {{mutually}} exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist. Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us a posteriori, that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge a priori– {{through the use of}} logic– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as Galen Strawson once wrote, [...] "you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science." [...] Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of epistemology, their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the theory of justification.|$|E

Are there SFD of newly formed self-secondaries idential for craters with different sizes and/or ages?

But it sometimes turns out that we were mistaken, or at any rate we come to think we were. We must be mistaken either in our previous opinion or in our subsequent recantation; therefore our beliefs are not all correct, and there are cases of belief which are not cases of knowledge. The question of verifiability is in essence this: can we discover any set of beliefs which are never mistaken or any test which, when applicable, will always enable us to discriminate between true and false beliefs? Put thus broadly and abstractly, the answer must be negative. There is no way hitherto discovered of wholly eliminating the risk of error, and no infallible criterion. If we believe we have found a criterion, this belief itself may be mistaken; we should be begging the question if we tried to test the criterion by applying the criterion to itself.|$|E

I shall give a single illustration of how this more celebrated than cerebrated [...] "divine" [...] is pleased to think that he thinks. He is replying to some one's application to this matter of Christ's injunction, [...] "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth." [...] This command, he gravely says, [...] "is not against money, nor against the making of money, but against the loving it for its own sake and the dedicating of it to self-aggrandizing uses." [...] I call this a foolish utterance, because it violates the good old rule of not telling an obvious falsehood. In no word nor syllable does Christ's injunction give the least color of truth to the reverend gentleman's [...] "interpretation;" [...] that is the reverend gentleman's very own, and doubtless he feels an honest pride in it. It {{is the product of a}} controversial need--a characteristic attempt to crawl out of a hole in an enclosure which he was not invited to enter.

Moreover, they are consistent with all that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of their author's life and character, for he not only lived in poverty and taught poverty as a blessing, but commanded it as a duty and a means of salvation. The probable effect of universal obedience among those who adore him as a god is not at present an urgent question. I think even so faithful a disciple as the Rev. Dr. Parkhurst has still a place to lay his head, a little of the wherewithal to be clothed, and a good deal of the power of interpretation to excuse it.|$|E

Yet, in our time, it seems to be both of these things at once: social values, like human rights, are both what justifies war, {{and what we need to}} protect from war. In this book, Nick Mansfield studies this paradox through a reading of canonical thinkers on war like Hobbes and Clausewitz, and also of other thinkers (from Freud and Bataille to Deleuze and Guattari, Levinas and Derrida) who have attempted to deal with our complex and contradictory relationship to war. He also investigates the way that the most influential recent thinkers (from Virilio and Baudrillard to Mbembe, Badiou and Zizek) have theorized war...|$|R

6000|$|In short, I would {{here only}} hint delicately {{that perhaps the}} mind which admittedly knew much of what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about ethics and economics, knew {{a little more than}} we are {{beginning}} to know about psychology and psychic phenomena. I remember reading, not without amusement, a severe and trenchant article in the Hibbert Journal, in which Christ's admission of demonology was alone thought enough to dispose of his divinity. The one sentence of the article, which I cherish in my memory through all the changing years, ran thus: [...] "If he was God, he knew {{there was no such thing}} as diabolical possession." [...] It did not seem to strike the Hibbert critic that this line of criticism raises the question, not of whether Christ is God, but of whether the critic in the Hibbert Journal is God. About that mystery as about the other I am for the moment agnostic; but I should have thought that the meditations of Omniscience on the problem of evil might be allowed, even by an agnostic, to be a little difficult to discover. Of Christ in the Gospels and in modern life I will merely for the moment say this; that if he was God, as the critic put it, it seems possible that he knew the next discovery in science, as well as the last, not to mention (what is more common in rationalistic culture) the last but three. And what will be the next discovery in psychological science nobody can imagine; and we can only say that if it reveals demons and their name is Legion, we can hardly be much surprised now. But at any rate the days are over of Omniscience like that of the Hibbert critic, who knows exactly what he would know if he were God Almighty. What is pain? What is evil? What did they mean by devils? What do we mean by madness? The rising generation, when asked by a venerable Victorian critic and catechist, [...] "What does God know?"
