25|$|After {{the last}} take, Miranda and Durante gave an impromptu {{performance}} on the set for the cast and technicians. The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> bed at about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, lit a cigarette, placed it in an ashtray and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup. She apparently came from the bathroom with a small, round mirror in her hand; in the small hall which led to her bedroom, she collapsed with a fatal heart attack. Miranda was 46 years old. Her body was found at about 10:30a.m. lying in the hallway. The Jimmy Durante Show episode in which Miranda appeared was aired two months after her death, on 15 October 1955, and a clip of the episode {{was included in the}} A Network's Biography episode about the singer.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the museum}} was {{equipped}} with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> the Dutch Room. As one of them approached Rembrandt's Self-Portrait (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting {{off the wall and}} [...] attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's The Storm on the Sea of Galilee out of the frame, as well as A Lady and Gentleman in Black. [...] They also removed Vermeer's The Concert and Govaert Flinck's Landscape with an Obelisk from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze gu from the Shang Dynasty.|$|E
50|$|In episode 3, Mr Capstick <b>goes</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> see Mr Merton {{before he}} has his cup of tea. After {{he has his}} tea, he says he'll <b>go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> see Mr Merton, so this radical {{diversion}} from the routine {{is too much for}} him in his senile state.|$|R
60|$|And having arrayed {{their little}} persons, these two {{harmless}} young bucks <b>go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> dinner.|$|R
60|$|Upon further inquiry, {{it turned}} out, {{to the good}} lady's {{unbounded}} astonishment, that Smike had, that moment, <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|R
500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the house}} surrounded, Dann <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> a bedroom. The Wassermans and Russell Dann {{were brought to}} the house. [...] At about 7:00p.m., an assault team entered the house while Mr. Wasserman {{attempted}} to get Dann's attention with a bullhorn. The police found her body in the bedroom; she had shot herself in the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|... "Ray Martin and I {{had worked}} {{together}} before, and he well {{knows that if}} I have the questions in advance, he'll get a better interview. Everyone knows this – politicians in particular. Ray duly faxed the questions to me, but {{on the morning of}} the recording changed them. I was bewildered by this (I think a researcher let him down). I terminated the interview when I didn't know what he was talking about and <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> lunch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I <b>go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> Mistress?" [...] Jack asked humbly. [...] "I've said my prayers, sir, and I've {{had a good}} cry--and my head's easier now." ...|$|R
60|$|PURDIE (finely). I must say, Mabel, that I am {{a little}} {{disappointed}} in you. I certainly understood that you had <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> put on your boots.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the public}} {{interest}} in Modern Spiritualism, Darwin attended a séance at Erasmus's house in January 1874, but as the room grew stuffy Darwin <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> lie down, missing the show, with sparks, sounds and the table rising above their heads. While Galton thought it a [...] "good séance", Darwin later wrote [...] "The Lord have mercy on us all, {{if we have to}} believe such rubbish" [...] and told Emma that it was [...] "all imposture" [...] and [...] "it would take an enormous weight of evidence" [...] to convince him otherwise. At a second séance Huxley and George found that Williams was nothing but a cheat, to Darwin's relief.|$|E
2500|$|He {{stayed there}} for four seasons and played firstly under Ron Atkinson and then former Leeds {{teammate}} Gordon Strachan. McAllister was a big name recruit to Big Ron's team of 1996–97. Yet the side, well garnished with typical Atkinson flair {{in the form of}} Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby never seemed to quite 'click' in the way of league results. Atkinson <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> become 'Director of Football' in late 1996 in order to make way for Strachan. Strachan's team continued to struggle that season but would go on to stage one of [...] the Premiership's greatest ever escapes. With McAllister captaining the side, the Sky Blues would secure an away draw against Arsenal and wins against Chelsea, Liverpool (away) and Tottenham Hotspur (away) to secure a seemingly impossible salvation.|$|E
60|$|Further {{consultation}} being thus deferred, I <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> the Minister's room.|$|E
6000|$|... "'D---- the statue!' begins Will; but I said, 'Don't, cousin! or {{you will}} wake up the old gentleman. Had we not best <b>go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> Miss Lyddy's tea-table?' ...|$|R
6000|$|It is nine o’clock now, a quarter-past nine, half-past nine—all {{the same}} moment to me, for I am at a {{sentence}} that will not write. I know, though I can’t hear, what my sister has <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> say to my mother:— ...|$|R
60|$|An hour later, Mrs. Ellison called. Reuben had <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> lie down, for his leg {{was very}} painful. Mrs. Whitney {{did not give}} her visitor time to begin.|$|R

60|$|And yet {{his brain}} reeled as he <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> his uncle's private room.|$|E
60|$|Miss Verinder {{went back}} to the sitting-room, and I <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Blake.|$|E
60|$|Dora said primly {{that she}} liked school; but she was very quiet, even for her; and when at {{twilight}} Marilla bade her <b>go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> bed she hesitated and began to cry.|$|R
60|$|Looking in {{over the}} short doors of the {{drinking}} place, Dick saw that Cuffer was not there. He rightly surmised that the fellow had <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs,</b> <b>to</b> a room he was occupying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor is it," [...] he {{answered}} promptly. [...] "You {{are in a}} difficult position, but you may find things not so bad as you imagine. At present my advice to you is this: <b>Go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> your room and stay there." ...|$|R

50|$|They {{decide to}} go through with it at the after prom party that Tucker had invited them to. On the day of prom, Tucker tells Eugene that he has the limo booked, which when pulls up, has already picked up Tucker's high school {{drop-out}} friend, Phil, who now goes by the MC name of Horsedick.MPEG (Craig Robinson). At the After Prom party, Cindi <b>goes</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> prepare, while Tucker takes Eugene into the kitchen and gives him several shots of hard alcohol. As Eugene leaves <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> meet Cindi, he walks through the wrong door, and falls down the steps into the basement. He is hurt so bad, that he falls into a coma for four years.|$|R
60|$|The {{dismissal}} {{made him}} feel strange, too. He wished he could <b>go</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> Frank, {{but he did not}} know how soon Mr. Joyce might want him. He wondered how Frank was getting along, and who the firm would get to help him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have barely}} {{a quarter of}} an hour, Stirling," [...] she said. [...] "It was too absurd of you to be sitting there talking to father all the time. Come and say nice things to me. Mother has <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> put on her tiara." ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> a very scantily furnished, doubled-bedded room. George, {{warned by}} {{previous}} experience, glanced around.|$|E

50|$|A waitress, <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> take clean sheets, {{noticed that}} the little {{painting}} of the Man of Sorrows, representing Jesus between the Virgin Mary and Saint John, was bleeding.

60|$|Finally, the Earl’s {{assertions that}} James had ridden away, assertions {{repeated}} {{after he had}} <b>gone</b> <b>upstairs</b> <b>to</b> inquire and make sure, are absolutely incompatible with innocence. They could have only one motive, to induce the courtiers to ride off and leave the King in his hands.|$|R
