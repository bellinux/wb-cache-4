2500|$|In {{non-uniform}} circular motion, {{normal force}} and weight may {{point in the}} same direction. [...] Both forces can point down, yet the object will remain in a circular path without falling straight down. [...] First let’s see why normal force can point down in the first place. [...] In the first diagram, let's say the object is a person sitting inside a plane, the two forces point down only when it reaches {{the top of the}} circle. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} the normal force is the sum of the tangential force and centripetal force. The tangential force is zero at the top (as no work is performed when the motion is perpendicular to the direction of force applied. Here <b>weight</b> <b>force</b> is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object at the top of the circle) and centripetal force points down, thus normal force will point down as well. [...] From a logical standpoint, a person who is travelling in the plane will be upside down at the top of the circle. [...] At that moment, the person’s seat is actually pushing down on the person, which is the normal force.|$|E

50|$|For other situations, {{such as when}} {{objects are}} {{subjected}} to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface, the <b>weight</b> <b>force</b> {{is proportional to the}} mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall, which is called the proper acceleration. Through such mechanisms, objects in elevators, vehicles, centrifuges, and the like, may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects, resulting from planetary surfaces. In such cases, the generalized equation for weight W of an object is related to its mass m by the equation W = -ma, where a is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity. (Again, if gravity is the only influence, such as occurs when an object falls freely, its weight will be zero).|$|E

50|$|Weighing scales (or weigh scales or scales) are {{devices to}} measure weight or {{calculate}} mass. Spring balances or spring scales measure <b>weight</b> (<b>force)</b> by balancing the force {{due to gravity}} against the force on a spring, whereas a balance or pair of scales using a balance beam compares masses by balancing the weight due to the mass of an object against {{the weight of a}} known mass or masses. Either type can be calibrated to read in units of force such as newtons, or in units of mass such as kilograms, but the balance or pair of scales using a traditional balance beam to compare masses will read correctly for mass even if moved to a place with a different (non-zero) gravitational field strength (but would then not read correctly if calibrated in units of force), while the spring balance would read correctly in force in a different gravitational field strength (but would not read correctly if calibrated in units of mass).|$|E
50|$|In {{non-uniform}} circular motion, {{normal force}} and weight may {{point in the}} same direction. Both forces can point down, yet the object will remain in a circular path without falling straight down. First let’s see why normal force can point down in the first place.

The {{reason for this is that}} the normal force is the sum of the tangential force and centripetal force. The tangential force is zero at the top (as no work is performed when the motion is perpendicular to the direction of force applied. Here <b>weight</b> <b>force</b> is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object at the top of the circle) and centripetal force points down, thus normal force will point down as well. From a logical standpoint, a person who is travelling in the plane will be upside down at the top of the circle. At that moment, the person’s seat is actually pushing down on the person, which is the normal force.|$|E
50|$|Lyotard found {{particularly}} interesting {{the explanation of}} the sublime offered by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgment (sometimes Critique of the Power of Judgment). In this book, Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms: {{there are two kinds}} of 'sublime' experience. In the 'mathematically' sublime, an object strikes the mind in such a way that we find ourselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely, we experience a clash between our reason (which tells us that all objects are finite) and the imagination (the aspect of the mind that organizes what we see, and which sees an object incalculably larger than ourselves, and feels infinite). In the 'dynamically' sublime, the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than we, whose <b>weight,</b> <b>force,</b> scale could crush us without the remotest hope of our being able to resist it. (Kant stresses that if we are in actual danger, our feeling of anxiety is very different from that of a sublime feeling. The sublime is an aesthetic experience, not a practical feeling of personal danger.) This explains the feeling of anxiety.|$|E
