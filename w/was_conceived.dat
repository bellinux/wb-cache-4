5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist. He argued that if something can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist, then something greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived.</b> Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist and so it must exist.

50|$|Anselm of Canterbury {{composed}} the ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God, which he believed to be irrefutable. In essence, he argued that because God is by definition the being than which no greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived,</b> and it <b>is</b> more perfect to exist than not to exist, that conceiving God not to exist <b>was</b> not <b>conceiving</b> God at all - it <b>was</b> <b>conceiving</b> a being less than perfect, which would not be God.
