In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that he was not sure if there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> Smash Bros. game in the series. In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. However, the rumour was debunked upon the release of the Switch.|$|E
5|$|The April 15 eclipse was {{the first}} eclipse in a tetrad; that is, four {{consecutive}} total eclipses with no partial eclipses in between. There <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> eclipse every six lunar cycles during the tetrad – on October 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015. The lunar year series repeats after 12 cycles, or 354 days, causing a date shift {{when compared to the}} solar calendar. This shift means the Earth's shadow will move about 11 degrees west in each subsequent eclipse.|$|E

25|$|Fortnight: Half a synodic month (29.53 days).

Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance.

500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, the tour {{began to be}} re-examined by critics, and {{the tone of the}} {{coverage}} began to change. In 2009, an article in the BBC News singled out the Glass Spider Tour's innovative set and marriage of music and theatre as an inspiration to later acts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, U2 and others. Stage designer Willie Williams said the Glass Spider Tour was a template for those acts: [...] "There will be one set of costumes and they will do a few songs, then there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> big scene change and {{move on to the next}} thing. Bowie crossing rock 'n' roll with Broadway [...] was where that began." [...] In 2010, the Glass Spider Tour won an award for being one of the best concert designs of all time (alongside other such notable tours as U2's 360° Tour [...] and Pink Floyd's Division Bell Tour [...] ).|$|E

On its online edition, Rolling Stones writer Daniel Kreps praised the song for its up-tempo melody and racy lyrics, while comparing it to Flo Rida's recent work, saying that [...] "3" [...] "is more of a surefire dance-floor stomper than anything Brit loaded onto Blackout or Circus". On the printed issue, the magazine gave the song four stars and called it an [...] "instant Britney classic". Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a fembot voice, near-seizure-inducing dance-floor frenzy". While crediting the production for [...] "elevating the song above typical dance products", the Los Angeles Times said that Spears sounded [...] "sweetly generic".|$|E
500|$|At the team's annual awards night, Farmer won {{the award}} for fewest {{turnovers}} per minute played (32 in 705 minutes), but the free throw award [...] won by Farmer the previous three years [...] went to Gimel Martinez. Athletics director C. M. Newton surprised the four seniors by hanging their jerseys in the rafters at Rupp Arena. In so doing, he violated the standards for the honor set by former athletics director Cliff Hagan. Those guidelines held that honorees must have completed a degree from the university and be at least 10 years removed {{from the end of}} their athletic eligibility. Newton cited the seniors' [...] "unusual and outstanding contributions" [...] to the program as reasons to make an exception to the standards, adding, [...] "I won't say there never <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> exception, but the likelihood of another is not great." [...] Sportscaster Cris Collinsworth protested Newton's action because it honored the seniors before other program standouts like Kyle Macy and Rick Robey.|$|E

(He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that [...] "e don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more... had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition.

500|$|Coe's {{interpretation}} {{was repeated}} by other scholars {{through the early}} 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. [...] "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," [...] said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. [...] "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention." [...] In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya [...] "did not conceive this {{to be the end of}} creation, as many have suggested." [...] Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, [...] "We have no record or knowledge that [...] would think the world would come to an end" [...] in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, [...] "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," [...] and, [...] "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in." [...] "There <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> cycle," [...] said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. [...] "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this." [...] Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said [...] "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset." ...|$|E
