His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen,</b> but with a slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E
5|$|On the February 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their {{complaints}} about Lesnar {{not being in}} the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's challenge by stabbing Lesnar <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> and chokeslamming him through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar would attempt to break the Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1835, {{tensions}} and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled. Monroe County, Michigan, Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney, but when Stickney {{and his three}} sons resisted, the whole family was subdued and taken into custody. During the scuffle, Two Stickney, son of the major, stabbed Wood <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> knife and fled south into Ohio. Wood's injuries were not life-threatening. When Lucas refused Mason's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial, Mason wrote to President Jackson for help, suggesting that the matter be referred to the United States Supreme Court. At {{the time of the}} conflict it was not established that the Supreme Court could resolve state boundary disputes, and Jackson declined the offer. Looking for peace, Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict, again through federal intervention via Ohio's congressional delegation.|$|E

25|$|Caslon {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp the moulds or matrices used to cast metal type. He worked {{in the tradition of}} what is now called old-style serif letter design, that produced letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen.</b> Caslon established a tradition of engraving type in London, which previously had not been common, and so he was influenced by the imported Dutch Baroque typefaces that were popular in England at the time. His typefaces established a strong reputation for their quality and their attractive appearance, suitable for extended passages of text.|$|E
25|$|Agrell {{continued}} nominating Merezhkovsky {{up until}} {{his own death}} in 1937 (making eight such nominations, in all), but each year the latter's chances were getting slimmer. The books he produced in his latter years (like the compilation of religious biographies Faces of Saints: from Jesus to Nowadays and The Reformers trilogy, published posthumously) weren't ground-breaking. Hard times and deepening troubles notwithstanding, Merezhkovsky continued to work hard till his dying day, trying desperately to complete his Spanish Mysteries trilogy; {{the last of the}} three pieces, the unfinished Little Theresa, was with him at his deathbed; he died literally <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> in his hand.|$|E
25|$|Man Ray {{abandoned}} conventional {{painting to}} involve himself with Dada, a radical anti-art movement. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of Rope Dancer, he combined a spray-gun technique <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> drawing. Like Duchamp, he did readymades—ordinary {{objects that are}} selected and modified. His Gift readymade (1921) is a flatiron with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and Enigma of Isidore Ducasse is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. Aerograph (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.|$|E

25|$|After No Way Out, Vince McMahon {{continued}} his feud with Hulk Hogan, {{in which he}} proclaimed that Hulkamania was dead and proclaiming a new 'mania; McMahonamania. On the March 6 episode of SmackDown!, Hogan informed McMahon that Hulkamania was not dead and that McMahon {{had nothing to do}} with creating it. McMahon informed Hogan that he did not hate Hulkamaniacs or Hulkamania, but he hated Hogan; McMahon explained that he hated Hogan, because he left WWE and went to work for Ted Turner's promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW). McMahon also stated that he hated Hogan for the fact that Hogan testified against him in his steroid trial. McMahon challenged Hogan to a match at WrestleMania XIX, to the stipulation that if he beats Hogan, he will never wrestle again and stating he would kill Hulkamania. On the March 20 episode of SmackDown!, the contract signing between McMahon and Hogan's match at WrestleMania took place. During the contract signing, McMahon attacked Hogan from behind with a steel chair. The attack led to McMahon stabbing Hogan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> in the forehead and forcing him to sign the contract in his blood. At WrestleMania XIX, Hogan defeated McMahon after three Leg drops.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen.</b> It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E
