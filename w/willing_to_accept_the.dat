For three days the coffin of the King, draped in the Danish and Greek flags, lay in the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens before his body was committed to a tomb at his palace in Tatoi. Unlike his father, the new king, Constantine, was to prove less <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> advice of ministers, or that of the three protecting powers (Britain, France and Russia).|$|E
5|$|The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert I, died in January 1228. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent {{was needed}} to rule the Latin Empire since Baldwin was ten years old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire {{suspected}} {{that he wanted to}} unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, an ally of the Holy See.|$|E

5|$|In February 1878, {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War, the British were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> {{occupation}} of the Ottoman Turkish capital of Constantinople by Russian forces and began to prepare for war. The British government made informal inquiries about purchasing the two corvettes, but this was firmly rejected by the Japanese government. The ships sailed from Britain in February–March and arrived in Yokohama two months later. They were sailed to Japan by hired British crews as the IJN lacked the necessary experience. The ships were not formally {{turned over to the}} navy until 10 July when a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ships were opened for public tours after the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|In late October, Al-Kamil sent {{messengers}} to the crusaders {{offering to}} restore Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth {{to them if}} they withdrew from Egypt. Although John and the secular lords were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> sultan's offer, Pelagius and {{the heads of the}} military orders resisted; they said that the Moslems could easily recapture the three towns. The crusaders ultimately refused the offer. Al-Kamil tried to send provisions to Damietta across their camp, but his men were captured on 3 November. Two days later, the crusaders stormed into Damietta and seized the town. Pelagius claimed it for the church, but he was forced to acknowledge John's right to administer it (at least temporarily) when John threatened to leave the crusaders' camp. According to John of Joinville, John seized one-third of Damietta's spoils; coins minted there during the following months bore his name. Al-Mu'azzam Isa, Sultan of Damascus, invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem and pillaged Caesarea before the end of 1219.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, 2013, Sims {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics. He {{was one of four}} nonguaranteed {{training}} camp invites (along with Damen Bell-Holter, Kammron Taylor and Chris Babb), vying for the final roster spot after accounting for the 14 guaranteed contracts. He was one of three small forwards invited to camp, along with Jeff Green, Gerald Wallace. On October 26, 2013, he was waived by the Celtics who waived all four nonguaranteed invitees reducing their roster to 14. After waiving the four players, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said all four were welcome to join the team's D-League affiliate, Maine Red Claws, if they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> low paying salary instead of higher paying offers overseas. Sims {{was the only one of}} the four who did not sign with the Red Claws by the end of the month. That year, he went on to sign with Hapoel Gilboa Galil of the Israeli Basketball Super League. In August 2014, he signed with Jeonju KCC Egis of the Korean Basketball League.|$|E
5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D.

The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove {{to make the best of}} it, working within the existing framework.|$|E

40|$|Videoconferencing {{is a way}} to {{make people}} meet {{regardless}} of the geo-graphical distance between them. In recent years, it has become possible to use the Internet as a carrier for communication of this type. This has opened up new opportunities to use computers that already are connected to the Internet as vehicles for video-mediated communication. In this Master the-sis, we have explored some possibilities to use video-mediated communica-tion in an organisational setting ö where the purpose was to support aware-ness and informal, social interaction between geographically dispersed loca-tions. An ethnographical study was conducted at an IT-research institute, fo-cusing on the instituteâs memberâs behaviour around and assumptions of an implemented videoconference prototype. The users testified that, albeit they found it interesting, the prototype was too weak in mediating interaction in a completely natural way. Some issues of privacy and integrity matters were also hampering <b>the</b> userâs <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> system. The result of this study points out some social and technological factors that are important to ac-knowledge when designing future video-mediated communication systems dedicated to support awareness and informal communication...|$|R

5000|$|The present Irish {{members of}} the English Parliament {{constitute}} an obstacle {{to be removed from}} the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue {{in the eyes of the}} world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the uniform of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.|$|R

Had this been the case, the Directors would have continued to listen to that voice to which it seems they were so obedient: they would have proceeded with the negotiation upon that basis. But the fact is, that they instantly broke up the negotiation, as soon as they had obliged our ambassador to violate all the principles of treaty, and weakly, rashly, and unguardedly to expose, without any counter proposition, the whole of our project with regard to ourselves and our allies, and without holding out the smallest hope that they would admit the smallest part of our pretensions.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{disagreements}} primarily involved {{personal or}} group political ambitions, the debate {{leading to the}} initial vote of confidence centered {{on the issue of}} Greater Somalia.

They also required a pool solution with employees in the national companies. When the parties met in Copenhagen on 25 June, the Swedish demands were rejected and the meeting quickly dissolved, with DDL and DNL stating that they would establish their own consortium. SILA was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> Danish–Norwegian terms, and even threatened to liquidate themselves—and thereby eliminate all private capital from the Swedish airlines—if Aerotransport did not compromise.
