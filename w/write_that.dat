5|$|Eva Perón then {{created the}} Female Peronist Party, the first large female {{political}} {{party in the}} nation. Navarro and Fraser <b>write</b> <b>that</b> by 1951, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. Navarro and Fraser <b>write</b> <b>that</b> while Eva Perón did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Perón. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage {{and the organization of}} the Female Peronist Party granted Juan Perón a large majority (sixty-three percent) of the vote in the 1951 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Terang Boelan (1937; based on The Jungle Princess), the {{domestic}} movie-making industry began to model their productions after Hollywood works, as this was expected to ensure financial success. The Indonesian film scholars Ekky Imanjaya and Said Salim <b>write</b> <b>that</b> Kedok Ketawa was influenced by Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula through its Hollywood adaptations. Neither writer gives comparisons to illustrate this influence.|$|E

5|$|For Reich, {{character}} {{structure was}} the result of social processes, in particular a reflection of castration and Oedipal anxieties playing themselves out within the nuclear family. Les Greenberg and Jeremy Safran <b>write</b> <b>that</b> Reich proposed a functional identity between the character, emotional blocks, and tension in the body, or what he called character (or muscular/body) armour (Charakterpanzer).|$|E
5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey <b>write</b> <b>that</b> Saruman's actions {{in the first half}} of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at Parth Galen, and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms <b>write</b> <b>that</b> it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree to}} which the {{character}} of Alice can be identified as Alice Liddell is controversial. Some critics identify the character as Liddell, or <b>write</b> <b>that</b> she inspired the character. Others argue that Carroll considered his protagonist and Liddell to be separate. According to Carroll, his character was not based on any real child, but was entirely fictional.|$|E

5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} {{in the film}} is a heavily criticized plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary. In Keyframes: Popular Cinema and Cultural Studies, Matthew Tinkcom and Amy Villarejo <b>write</b> <b>that</b> Christie reinforces an Alien-franchise trope (shared by Parker in Alien and Dillon in Alien 3) where black characters save and sacrifice themselves for Caucasian characters. The theme of hybridization is exemplified by Christie and Vriess, according to Rizzo in Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction; while the two characters are harnessed together, they alternate movement, support and combat.|$|E
5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} it that Philomela {{was turned into}} a swallow, which has no song; Procne turns into a nightingale, singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats <b>write</b> <b>that</b> although she was tongueless, Philomela {{was turned into a}} nightingale, and Procne into a swallow. Eustathius' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|E
5|$|Even {{classical}} historians, {{who were}} writing only {{years after the}} events themselves, seem to be divided {{as to what the}} motives of Spartacus were. Appian and Florus <b>write</b> <b>that</b> he intended to march on Rome itself—although this may have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E

Official Xbox Magazines Jon Hicks praised the narrative of Portal 2 and cited Wheatley's [...] "chirpy idiocy" [...] as a contributing factor to its quality. OXMs Ryan McCaffrey <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Wheatley was [...] "played to perfection" [...] by Merchant. Computer and Video Games' Andy Robinson <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Wheatley's personality was [...] "equally loud" [...] to GLaDOS and [...] "brilliant". GameZone's Ben PerLee <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Wheatley was [...] "cute but stupid" [...] and called him [...] "adorable and bumbling, a lovable little guy who is much more involved than you might expect". The Escapists Russ Pitts <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Wheatley was [...] "a helpful - if dumb - robot companion with a chipper English accent". The Globe and Mails Chad Sapieha <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant was [...] "enormously entertaining as a slow-witted sphere". Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the casting Merchant was a brilliant choice".

5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an illegitimate child. Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further <b>write</b> <b>that</b> the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
5|$|In The History of The Lord of the Rings series Christopher Tolkien {{recorded}} {{that his}} father had not foreseen the emergence of Faramir during the writing of the book, only inventing him at the actual point of his appearance in The Two Towers. J.R.R.Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan. Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien would <b>write</b> <b>that</b> of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to <b>write</b> <b>that</b> Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E

5|$|Reviewing {{the quality}} of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin <b>write</b> <b>that</b> his Javanese {{pictures}} are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his cityscapes. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the Governor General's Palace {{and the home of}} Raden Saleh. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that they were meant to fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of his images, particularly the portraits, were hand-tinted.|$|E
5|$|Serbia {{started to}} {{disintegrate}} {{after the death}} of Stefan Dušan. According to Matteo Villani, an unidentified Serbian lord sought Hungarian assistance against his more powerful (and also unnamed) enemy in the late 1350s. Historians John V. A. Fine and Pál Engel <b>write</b> <b>that</b> the Serbian lord {{was a member of the}} Rastislalić family; Gyula Kristó and Iván Bertényi identify him as Lazar Hrebeljanović. Royal charters of 1358 show that Hungarian troops fought in Serbia in October 1358. The next summer Louis also marched to Serbia, but Stefan Uroš V of Serbia avoided battle.|$|E

IGN's Charles Onyett <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> it's [...] "difficult to overstate how Merchant's obvious enthusiasm for the role benefits the game" [...] and that [...] "no word Wheatley speaks is without witty inflection, and the consistently clever writing perfectly complements the onscreen action". He also <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant's Wheatley [...] "steals the show" [...] while GLaDOS and Cave Johnson's voice actors Ellen McLain and J.K. Simmons turn in solid performances. PALGN's Adam Ghiggino <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant's performance was [...] "brilliant" [...] and that he has [...] "a lot of emotion to his movement". Video Gamer's Jamin Smith <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant's voice was familiar and <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Wheatley [...] "possesses more personality than the cast of most other games put together" [...] despite [...] "a lack of any distinguishing features at all" [...] in its appearance.|$|R
5|$|The Sociedad de Beneficencia (Society of Beneficence), {{a charity}} group {{made up of}} 87 society ladies, was {{responsible}} for most charity works in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Perón. Fraser and Navarro <b>write</b> <b>that</b> {{at one point the}} Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but that those days had long since passed {{by the time of the}} first term of Juan Perón. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the Sociedad was supported by the government.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They <b>write</b> <b>that</b> these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.|$|E
5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook <b>write</b> <b>that</b> politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this {{monograph}}y is Discourses of Writing in the Curriculum of the A-course in Swedish. The aim of this monograph is to find wich forms and discourses of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are emphasized and premiered in the curriculum for the first course in Swedish during secondary education in Sweden, grades 10 - 12. What kind of writing are presented to the students and what potentially miss due to the selection? Is any form of writing presented more thoroughly or as {{more important than any}} other in the curriculum? The professor of linguistics, Roz Ivanic, has formed different discourses of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> she has found being used in education of writing. With these discourses of writing  I have applied them on the curriculum and then been able to see wich forms of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are premiered. By using close reading as a method of analyze I have been able to interpret the curriculum. I have connected close reading as a method with the hermeneutic analysis tradition. The discourses of writing is my tool and my theory wich holds different forms of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are connected to earlier science of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> I present as a background in the monograph. The conclusion I have reached are that the curriculum holds four discourses of <b>writing.</b> <b>That</b> means that the form of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are presented to the students are a writing to imitate other types of texts, a grammatical correct spelling, a thotoughly processed text and knowledge about their own mental process that is activated during writing. The diskourse of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> is presented as the most important in the curriculum is the skills discourse of <b>writing.</b> <b>That</b> leads to a form of writing in grammatically correct writing and prepares the students to adjust to a <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> is presented mainly in higher forms of education...|$|R
