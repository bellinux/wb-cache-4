5|$|There {{are three}} special cap power-ups appear {{in certain areas}} on many stages. The <b>Wing</b> <b>Cap</b> allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to {{withstand}} wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the <b>Wing</b> <b>Cap</b> equipped, cannons {{can be used to}} reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.|$|E

50|$|The {{central axis}} of the facade rises one floor higher than the two <b>wings,</b> <b>capped</b> by a {{tympanum}} supported by volutes. The main ground floor entrance in the center section is a carved stone portal that opens into a spacious atrium, which in turn opens onto the garden. There is a richly decorated balcony above the portal, with triple arch lancet windows. A more modest version of the balcony and the triple arched windows is repeated on the next floor. Above these, the facade is decorated with carved dragons over the two side windows and {{a representation of the}} family crest on the tympanum over the taller central window.|$|R

50|$|Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Florida <b>Wing</b> <b>CAP</b> members flew aerial missions, {{performed}} ground missions, and {{oversaw the}} distribution of more than 30,000 pounds of relief supplies. After Hurricane Wilma struck Florida, pilots from the Florida Wing flew 63 air missions over 147 hours and carried out 21 ground mission over 902 man-hours, with more than 160 Florida members participating in emergency response activities.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Ernest Faber Fookes (31 May 1874 - 3 March 1948) was a New Zealand-born rugby union <b>wing</b> who was <b>capped</b> for the England {{national}} team on ten occasions between 1896 and 1899.|$|R
50|$|A new version, JS1C-21m, with 3 metre wing-tips, which {{increase}} the span to 21 metres, has been developed. The first flight was on 22 March 2012. Because {{of the higher}} wing loads and increased maximum take-off mass of 720 kg (increased from 600 kg), the wing/wingtip junction has been redesigned including stronger <b>wing</b> spar <b>caps</b> and thicker wing-tip spars. All future JS1 Revelations will be compatible with the optional 21m wing-tips.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1793, U.S. coinage {{frequently}} showed Columbia/Liberty {{wearing the}} cap. The anti-federalist movement likewise instrumentalized the figure, as in a cartoon from 1796 in which Columbia is overwhelmed {{by a huge}} American eagle holding a Liberty Pole under its <b>wings.</b> The <b>cap's</b> last appearance on circulating coinage was the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, which was minted through 1947 (and reused on the current bullion American Silver Eagle).|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} the first 3D and open world game in the series, and a launch title for Nintendo's Nintendo 64 home console. Each level, or course, is an {{enclosed}} environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas. The Nintendo 64's analog stick makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced new moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a <b>Wing</b> <b>Cap</b> to fly. It is the first Super Mario series game to feature Charles Martinet's voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and return them to her castle, the overworld. There are a total of 105 Power Stars in the paintings, with 15 hidden in the castle. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, instead as three different hats with temporary powers: the <b>Wing</b> <b>Cap,</b> allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.|$|E
5000|$|A reoccurring {{power-up}} {{throughout the}} series is an item that gives Mario the ability of flight. The first of this type was introduced in Super Mario Bros. 3: one power-up, which gives Mario a raccoon suit, is called the Super Leaf, [...] while another is called the Tanooki Suit (a transliteration of tanuki) and grants Mario the ability to fly or turn into a statue. In Super Mario World, an item called the Cape Feather was introduced that gave Mario a cape. In Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, a carrot was available that gave Mario rabbit ears {{that allowed him to}} fly, and in Super Mario 64, Mario could acquire an item called the <b>Wing</b> <b>Cap,</b> which temporarily gave him the ability of flight. Super Mario Sunshine introduces a pump-water spraying device named [...] "F.L.U.D.D.", which abilities included spraying water and hovering.|$|E
50|$|The goldenface {{is a small}} whistler, around 13 cm {{in length}} and {{weighing}} 14 - 19 g. The plumage of the species is striking; the nominate subspecies has a slate grey back, tail, <b>wing,</b> <b>cap</b> and {{back of the neck}} and bright yellow face, throat, breast and belly. From the crown to the shoulder the face is bordered with a black line, and the terital feathers of the wing are tipped with black and white. The eye and bill is black and the legs are pink. There is a small amount of sexual dimorphism, with the female resembling the male closely except in having a dusky patch on the face. Immature birds of either sexes resemble the female. The three other subspecies resemble the nominate subspecies with minor differences. The subspecies P. f. subaurantium has darker upperparts and a slight orange tint. P. f. randi has much oranger underparts and face, and P. f. subpallidiumm has much paler upperparts and the most yellow undersides. The identification of goldenface study skins held in museum collections is complicated by the tendency of the plumage colours used to identify the subspecies fading after death.|$|E
50|$|Adults of both extant {{species are}} about 44 cm (17 inches) long, {{and have a}} blue-black back and <b>wings,</b> a black <b>cap</b> and short yellow legs. Juveniles are browner above and {{streaked}} below, and have greenish-yellow legs.|$|R
50|$|Guy Novès (born 5 February 1954) is {{a former}} French rugby union player and current coach of the French {{national}} team. Born in Toulouse, Novès, who played on the <b>wing,</b> was <b>capped</b> seven times for his nations, and played with Stade Toulousain from 1975 to 1987 {{and was a member}} of the team that won the Bouclier de Brennus in 1985 and 1986. He later coached the side in a tenure that lasted 22 years, where he won the French championship nine times and the Heineken Cup four times.|$|R

50|$|Jasmine Joyce (born 1 October 1995) is a Welsh rugby union player. Joyce, {{who plays}} at <b>wing,</b> has been <b>capped</b> at {{national}} level {{as part of the}} Wales women's national rugby sevens team and In 2016, she was named as part of the Great Britain sevens team to play at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.|$|R
50|$|Standing {{completely}} detached {{in its own}} grounds, it {{was designed}} in the French Renaissance architecture style. The centre portion is recessed with a loggia of four arches, paved with Encaustic tiles. On the left wing, the bar entrance has a pediment flanked by Doric pilasters. The right wing contained the commercial and drawing-rooms and was finished with a two-storied bay-window. A massive cornice, with parapets and pediments, covers the front, left and right sides of the building. On the roof, each <b>wing</b> is <b>capped</b> with a pavilion having bevelled-corners and crowned with an ornamental iron cresting and tall flag-poles. Externally the walls are tuck-pointed with rusticated quoins at the angles.|$|R
50|$|Gabe won {{his first}} cap for Wales against Ireland in 1901, playing on the left <b>wing.</b> His 24 <b>caps</b> for Wales {{included}} the famous 1905 victory against New Zealand, and he captained Wales in the 1907 match against Ireland. He toured Australasia with the British Isles team of 1904. He played in all four test matches, including the three victories over Australia.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century Swansea RFC was an {{extremely}} successful club. For four consecutive seasons Swansea were the unofficial Welsh champions from the 1898/99 season through to 1901/02, coinciding with the heyday of Swansea's first star player Billy Bancroft. Under the captaincy of Frank Gordon the team would later go on a 22-month unbeaten run, from December 1903 through to October 1905. During this period Swansea appeared to be under-represented at international level. Gordon himself went uncapped throughout his entire career, and apart from Billy Trew, Dick Jones and Dicky Owen, the only other internationals in the senior team were forward Sid Bevan (1 <b>cap),</b> <b>wing</b> Jowett (1 <b>cap)</b> and outside-half Phil Hopkins (4 caps). [...] Trew (29 caps) was an outstanding centre who was accepted {{as one of the most}} important players in the evolution of Welsh rugby, [...] while Dicky Owen (35 caps), although only 5 foot 4 inches tall, was an incredible tactician.|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} breakthroughs {{required for}} the development of fully reusable launch vehicles are reviewed, with a focus on advanced materials and structures. Current proposals favor LH 2 as a fuel for both conventional dual-stage rockets, vertical-launch SSTO rockets, and horizontal-launch airbreathing SSTOs; hence large cryogenic tanks and thermal protection (for descent in rockets and ascent in airbreathers) are required. Consideration is given to structural alloys and composites; thermal-protection materials; propellant-tank insulation materials; the design of light but strong tanks, <b>wings,</b> nose <b>caps,</b> and airbreathing-engine structures; and the problem of hot boundary-layer gases. The need for more accurate and efficient design codes (including dynamic loads and aerothermoelasticity) and for better ground test facilities is stressed...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is predominantly}} made from wood {{and covered in}} doped Ceconite. The wing leading edge is made from poplar plywood and supported by nose ribs made from marine-grade plywood. The <b>wing</b> spar <b>cap</b> strips and tail ribs are fashioned from spruce. The tailboom is an aluminium tube. Its wing is cantilevered and tapered from wing root to wing tip. The VJ-23 lands and takes off on foot, but the aircraft is equipped with small wheels {{to allow it to}} be pulled up a hill. The aircraft's rigid wing structure requires that it be transported in a trailer, rather than rolled up and carried on a roof rack like a hang glider.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Chalk's International Airlines owned by Merv Griffin's Resorts International had 13 Albatrosses {{converted}} to Standard category as G-111s. This made them eligible {{to be used}} in scheduled airline operations. These aircraft had extensive modification from the standard military configuration, including rebuilt wings with titanium <b>wing</b> spar <b>caps,</b> additional doors and modifications to existing doors and hatches, stainless steel engine oil tanks, dual engine fire extinguishing systems on each engine and propeller auto feather systems installed. The G-111s were operated for only a few years and then put in storage in Arizona. Most are still parked there, but some have been returned to regular flight operations with private operators.|$|R
25|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation by}} the NTSB showed that the <b>wing's</b> lower spar <b>cap</b> had extensive stress fatigue and had fractures through the lower spar cap, vertically up the spar web and into the upper spar <b>cap.</b> The lower <b>wing</b> skin also found signs of fatigue in the area adjacent to the cracked spar cap. An examination of two other similar aircraft showed that the area of cracking was hidden from view by other fuselage structure.|$|R
5000|$|Before 1960, sports/racing cars {{usually had}} Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels center-locking {{equipped}} with splined hubs and a quick-release [...] "knockoff" [...] (central <b>wing</b> nut) locking <b>cap</b> {{that could be}} unscrewed by striking a wing of the nut with a special alloy mallet or [...] "knockoff hammer". Some jurisdictions, including West Germany, prohibited eared hubcaps. Some manufacturers (e.g. Maserati) preferred to hold the wheel on the splined hub by capping with a single conventional unwinged nut requiring a special large spanner.|$|R
