60|$|The system {{according}} to which we tried to interpret the myth is less ondoyant et divers. We do not even pretend to explain everything. We do not guess at the meaning and root of the word Cronus. We only find parallels to the myth among savages, whose mental condition is fertile in such legends. And we only infer that the myth of Cronus was originally evolved by persons also in the savage intellectual condition. The survival we explain as, in a previous essay, <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> <b>the</b> survival of the bull-roarer by the conservatism of the religious instinct.|$|E
6000|$|Well, my {{talking like}} that cheered him, {{and when we}} reached Birmingham he was easier. We tackled the station-master, and he tackled all the porters {{who could have been}} about the {{platform}} when the 5.13 came in. All of 'em agreed that no gent got out of that train carrying a hamper. The station-master was a family man himself, and when <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> <b>the</b> case to him he sympathised and telegraphed to Banbury. The booking-clerk at Banbury remembered only three gents booking by that particular train. One had been Mr. Jessop, the corn-chandler; the second was a stranger, who had booked to Wolverhampton; and the third had been young Milberry himself. The business began to look hopeless, when one of Smith's newsboys, who was hanging around, struck in: ...|$|E
60|$|One blazing hot day, {{a modest}} and courteous {{officer of the}} regular army {{appeared}} in our den and introduced himself. He was about thirty-five years old, well built and militarily erect and straight, and he was hermetically sealed up in the uniform of that ignorant old day--a uniform made of heavy material, and much properer for January than July. When he saw the venerable alley, and glanced from that to the long procession of shining balls in the trough, his eye lit with desire, and we judged that he was our meat. We politely invited {{him to take a}} hand, and he could not conceal his gratitude; though his breeding, and the etiquette of his profession, made him try. <b>We</b> <b>explained</b> <b>the</b> game to him, and said that there were forty-one balls, and that the player was privileged to extend his inning and keep on playing until he had used them all up--repeatedly--and that for every ten-strike he got a prize. We didn't name the prize--it wasn't necessary, as no prize would ever be needed or called for. He started a sarcastic smile, but quenched it, according to the etiquette of his profession. He merely remarked {{that he would like to}} select a couple of medium balls and one small one, adding that he didn't think he would need the rest.|$|E

5000|$|Several weeks later, Simon re-emerged {{with two}} new tracks, [...] "Punky's Dilemma" [...] and [...] "Overs", {{neither of which}} Nichols was {{particularly}} taken with. Nichols asked if the duo had any more songs to offer, and after {{a break from the}} meeting, they returned with an early version of [...] "Mrs. Robinson". They had been working on a track titled [...] "Mrs. Roosevelt", and returned to perform it for Nichols. He was ecstatic about the song, later commenting, [...] "They filled in with dee de dee dee de dee dee dee because there was no verse yet, but I liked even that." [...] Garfunkel later expanded upon the song's placement in The Graduate: Paul had been working on what is now 'Mrs. Robinson', but there was no name in it and we’d just fill in with any three-syllable name. And because of the character in the picture we just began using the name 'Mrs. Robinson' to fit ... and one day we were sitting around with Mike talking about ideas for another song. And I said ‘What about Mrs. Robinson.' Mike shot to his feet. 'You have a song called [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] and you haven’t even shown it to me?' So <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> <b>the</b> working title and sang it for him. And then Mike froze it for the picture as 'Mrs. Robinson'.|$|E
