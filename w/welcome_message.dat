The free Apple Remote application for the iPhone and iPod Touch was also updated {{at this time that}} added a new iTunes DJ option in the settings screen when the user is connected to a Wi-Fi network and a new song request feature is enabled in iTunes DJ on the hosts. Along with the song request feature voting on songs in the queue was added, the more votes a song gets the higher in the queue it will be and the sooner it will be played. Song voting can only be done when song requesting is enabled and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section. When song requesting is enabled a customizable <b>welcome</b> <b>message</b> is displayed below the host's shared library name in the button used to connect to iTunes DJ.|$|E

Shell remained CEO of Bomis in 2006, becoming vice-president of the Wikimedia Foundation and continuing to serve on its board.

30|$|In the {{login page}} that we consider, {{responses}} to valid requests include <b>welcome</b> <b>messages</b> and invalid input error messages.

Our approach focuses on the analysis of these differences. The objective is to identify, among several responses, those which correspond to execution pages generated through syntactically valid requests. In other words, we learn {{the behavior of the}} application based on the clustering of Web server response pages that are similar enough.|$|R

60|$|One lesson which I {{have learned}} in my roaming life, my friends, is never to call {{anything}} a misfortune until you have seen the end of it. Is not every hour a fresh point of view? In this case I soon perceived that accident had done for {{me as much as}} the most profound cunning. My guards naturally commenced their search from the place where I had taken Sir Charles Meredith's coat, and from my hiding-place I could see them hurrying along the road to that point. Not one of them ever dreamed that I could have doubled back from there, and I lay quite undisturbed in the little bush-covered cup at the summit of my knoll. The prisoners had, of course, learned of my escape, and all day exultant yells, like that which had aroused me in the morning, resounded over the moor, bearing a <b>welcome</b> <b>message</b> of sympathy and companionship to my ears. How little did they dream that on the top of that very mound, which they could see from their windows, was lying the comrade whose escape they were celebrating? As for me--I could look down upon this poor herd of idle warriors, as they paced about the great exercise yard, or gathered in little groups, gesticulating joyfully over my success. Once I heard a howl of execration, and I saw Beaumont, his head all covered with bandages, being led across the yard by two of the warders. I cannot tell you the pleasure which this sight gave me, for it proved that I had not killed him, and also that the others knew the true story of what had passed. They had all known me too well to think that I could have abandoned him.|$|E

30|$|The {{entry point}} of our {{algorithm}} {{is a set}} of initial requests that have a common property: it is easy to classify the associated responses (either as execution page or rejection page). Obviously, it is easier to generate requests which lead to rejection pages or execution pages corresponding to invalid input error messages than requests which lead to execution pages associated to <b>welcome</b> <b>messages.</b> To generate the former, one can, for example, use random usernames and passwords to fill the authentication form. One can also easily generate requests which lead to rejection pages associated to PHP or SQL error messages.|$|R

30|$|Moreover, as per the Computers as Social Actors theory [9], {{consumers}} reciprocate avatars’ interactions {{by forming}} social connections with them. Specifically, the social agency theory [30] posits that social cues in multimedia communication can prime social conversation schema in users. When social conversation schema is activated, automatic social response impels users to assign social connotations to the interaction. Besides, the persona effect {{indicates that the}} presence of human pictures is sufficient {{to create a sense of}} social presence in users [31]. Building on the aforementioned discussions, talking avatars can increase the sense of social presence by realistically simulating the role of sales advocates in online stores. In the traditional sales environment, perceptions of social presence are strongly dependent on interaction with sales advocates. Without face-to-face interaction, shopping experience becomes impersonal, cold, and distant. In this regard, talking avatars can mimic “frontline” advocates to provide social cues such as <b>welcome</b> <b>messages,</b> farewell messages, personalized greetings, and guided tour on products and services.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} year or two, unwelcome email has grown {{to the extent that it}} is inconvenient, {{annoying}} and wasteful of computer resources. More significantly, its volume threatens to overwhelm our ability to recognize <b>welcome</b> <b>messages,</b> and hence to destroy our trust in email as a reliable communication medium. An automatic spam filter can mitigate these problems, provided that it acts in a reliable and predictable manner. We evaluate ten spam detection methods embodied in six popular open-source spam filters by applying each method sequentially to all of the e-mail received by one individual (X) from August 2003 through March 2004. These 49, 086 messages were originally judged in real-time by X. The messages and judgements were recorded, and reproduced so as to provide the same evaluation suite for all the methods. Five of the methods are derived from Spamassassin [spamassassin. org 2004], a hybrid system which includes both static spam-detection rules and a Bayesian statisti...|$|R

50|$|Participants (usually {{referred}} to as users) connect to a MOO using telnet or some other, more specialized, client program. Upon connection, they are usually presented with a <b>welcome</b> <b>message</b> explaining how to either create a new character or connect to an existing one.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{increasing}} numbers of networks drop ICMP traffic (for example, to prevent denial-of-service attacks), which prevents path MTU discovery from working. One often detects such blocking in the cases where a connection works for low-volume data but hangs {{as soon as a}} host sends a large block of data. For example, with IRC a connecting client might see the initial messages up to and including the initial ping (sent by the server as an anti-spoofing measure), but get no response after that. This is because the large set of <b>welcome</b> <b>messages</b> are sent out in packets bigger than the real MTU. Also, in an IP network, the path from the source address to the destination address often gets modified dynamically, in response to various events (load-balancing, congestion, outages, etc.) - this could result in the path MTU changing (sometimes repeatedly) during a transmission, which may introduce further packet drops before the host finds a new reliable MTU.|$|R
30|$|The {{psychological}} {{effects of}} talking avatars on consumer behaviours can be {{ascribed to the}} theory of Computers as Social Actors (CASA) [9]. According to the CASA theory, people will unconsciously apply social rules to computers, especially when the computers exhibit human-like attributes. Hence, social cues such as facial expressions and conversational dialogues from talking avatars can trigger automatic social responses in people. For instance, some of the social rules found relevant in human–computer interaction include stereotype [10], inhibition/facilitation [11], politeness [12], personality matching/mismatching [13, 14], empathy [15], emotional contagion [16, 17], specialist-generalist attribution [18, 19], and venting [20]. Likewise, consumers tend to psychologically profile e-commerce avatars as (1) virtual assistant, (2) friendly host, and (3) recommender agent [21]. Avatars as virtual assistants provide help to consumers by pointing out special offers, guiding them through the payment process, pointing out sources of information, and searching the Web for requested items. Avatars, as friendly hosts, deliver <b>welcome</b> <b>messages,</b> farewell messages, and personalized greetings. They also provide guided tours of sites and description of products and services. Avatars as recommender agents provide suggestions of items based on personal consumer profile and past purchases.|$|R
