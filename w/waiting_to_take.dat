5|$|Not <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up his consulship in Rome, he {{left after}} his triumph {{but before the}} end of AD 17. He sailed down the Illyrian coast of the Adriatic Sea to Greece, where he {{restored}} the temple of Spes, and won a chariot race at the Olympic games that year. He arrived at Nicopolis near the site of the Battle of Actium, where he took up his second consulship on 18 January AD 18. He visited the sites associated with his adoptive grandfather Augustus and his natural grandfather Mark Antony, before crossing the sea to Lesbos and then to Asia Minor. There he visited the site of Troy and the oracle of Apollo Claros near Colophon. Piso left {{at the same time as}} Germanicus, but traveled directly to Athens and then to Rhodes where he and Germanicus met for the first time. From there Piso left for Syria where he immediately began replacing the officers with men loyal to himself in a bid to win the loyalty of his soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Haig {{returned}} {{briefly to}} India (taking {{time on his}} way to write a forty-page report on French cavalry manoeuvres in Touraine) as second-in-command of the squadron which he had himself commanded in 1892, then returned to the United Kingdom as Aide-de-camp to Sir Keith Fraser, Inspector General of Cavalry. Fraser {{was one of those who}} had lobbied for Haig to enter the Staff College, and he was finally nominated in late 1894, a common practice in the day for promising candidates. While <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up his place, he travelled to Germany to report on cavalry manoeuvres there, and also served as staff officer to Colonel John French (whom he had met in November 1891 whilst French was Commanding Officer of the 19th Hussars) on manoeuvres. The careers of French and Haig were to be entwined for the next twenty-five years, and Haig helped French write the cavalry drillbook, published 1896.|$|E
25|$|With Australia chasing 412 to win, {{they lost}} Rogers for 10 early on, ending his record-equalling run of half-centuries, but a 78-run {{partnership}} between Warner and Smith looked to have stabilised the innings. The stand {{was broken by}} Moeen Ali in the final over before lunch, trapping Warner LBW for 52. Australia then lost Smith (33), Clarke (4) and Voges (1) in the five overs following the interval; {{in the space of}} six overs, they had fallen from 97/1 to 106/5. Haddin was next to go, caught at short midwicket by Cook for 7; the England captain parried the ball up at the first attempt, but retained his focus to cling on at the second time of asking. Watson (19) did his best to reignite the innings before being trapped LBW {{for the second time in}} the match, reducing Australia to 151/7. Johnson and Starc then shared a 72-run partnership for the eighth wicket, only for Root's off spin to find both their edges to leave the tourists 169 behind with one wicket in hand. Root was again involved in the final wicket, as Moeen Ali tempted Hazlewood into a big shot down the ground to long on, where Root was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the catch and seal victory. For his contributions primarily with the bat, but also with the ball, Root was named Man of the Match.|$|E

25|$|Horthy's son MiklÃ³s Horthy, Jr. at this father's {{direction}} went to {{a meeting}} with representatives from the Yugoslavian government to finalize the surrender of Hungary to the Soviets. Upon entering the building, he was attacked and beaten by German soldiers commanded by Waffen SS Major Otto Skorzeny, who had initiated the meeting as a ruse. They kidnapped MiklÃ³s at gunpoint, trussed him up in a carpet, and immediately drove him to the airport, where a flight was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him to Germany and a concentration camp. Skorzeny then brazenly led a convoy of Germany troops and four Tiger II tanks to the Vienna Gates of Castle Hill. Seeking to avoid unneeded bloodshed, and knowing his forces could not resist the superior German troops, the Regent ordered his soldiers to not resist. Only one unit {{did not get the}} order, and the Germans quickly and with minimal bloodshed captured Castle Hill. Only seven soldiers were killed and 26 men were wounded. Horthy was arrested by Waffen SS BrigadefÃ¼hrer Edmund Veesenmayer and held overnight in SS offices. Faced with an overt threat to his son's life, and having already been effectively removed from power, under coercion and as a prisoner of war, he abrogated the armistice, deposed Premier GÃ©za Lakatos' government, and named the leader of the fanatical Arrow Cross Party, Ferenc SzÃ¡lasi, as Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|The {{version of}} the details of his life {{generally}} accepted by modern scholars, as elaborated by later sources, popular writers and folk piety, typically includes extra details such that Patrick, originally named Maewyn Succat, was born in 387 AD in (among other candidate locations, see above) Banna venta Berniae to the parents Calpernius and Conchessa. At the age of 16 in 403 AD Saint Patrick was captured and enslaved by the Irish and was sent to Ireland to serve as a slave herding and tending sheep in Dalriada. During his time in captivity Saint Patrick became fluent in the Irish language and culture. After six years, Saint Patrick escaped captivity after hearing a voice urging him to travel to a distant port where a ship would be <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him back to Britain. On his way back to Britain Saint Patrick was captured again and spent 60 days in captivity in Tours, France. During his short captivity within France, Saint Patrick learned about French monasticism. At the end of his second captivity Saint Patrick had a vision of Victoricus giving him the quest of bringing Christianity to Ireland. Following his second captivity Saint Patrick returned to Ireland and, using the knowledge of Irish language and culture that he gained during his first captivity, brought Christianity and monasticism to Ireland in the form of more than 300 churches and over 100,000 Irish baptised.|$|E
25|$|On 26 May 1963, BUA began a twice-daily rail-air-rail service {{between the}} city centres of London and Paris. The service, which was marketed as Silver Arrow in the UK and as FlÃ¨che d'argent in France, was a joint {{operation}} between British Rail (BR), BUA and SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Chemins de Fer franÃ§ais (SNCF). At London's Victoria Station, where BUA check-in facilities were available, Paris-bound passengers boarded a BR train to Gatwick Airport railway station. At Gatwick they transferred to a BUA Viscount, which flew them to Le Touquet Airport. At Le Touquet Airport an SNCF train was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them to Paris's Gare du Nord station. The entire journey took five hours and the minimum return fare was Â£10 9s. This compared with Skyways Coach-Air's London Victoria Coach Station â€” Lympne Airport â€” Beauvais Airport â€” Paris RÃ©publique Coach Station Â£11 return coach-air-coach fare. BUA's Silver Arrow service {{was an example of}} Laker turning an adversity into an opportunity. BUA's lack of traffic rights prevented it from running non-stop Gatwickâ€”Paris scheduled flights although it held a licence for that route, which the ATLB had awarded it in late 1961. Faced with this restriction, Laker hit upon the idea to offer an indirect travel option {{between the city}} centres of London and Paris by combining the existing Victoriaâ€”Gatwick rail link with BUA's Gatwick â€” Le Touquet traffic rights. At the time, Le Touquet Airport was not linked to the French railway network. As a result, the surface journey between the airport and Paris was difficult and time-consuming as this involved an intermodal change between coach and train at Ã‰taples. To overcome this drawback, Laker persuaded the French authorities to build a spur line into Le Touquet Airport so that BUA passengers could be met on arrival by a dedicated SNCF train that took them direct to Gare du Nord train station in the centre of Paris. BUA's new Londonâ€”Paris rail-air-rail service via Gatwick replaced a coach-air-coach/rail service it had operated on this route via Lydd. BUA Silver Arrow fares were less than what BEA and Air France charged their passengers to fly non-stop between Heathrow and Paris to compensate for the longer travelling times (5 hr vs. 2 hr 45 min.).|$|E
