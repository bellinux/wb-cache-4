When {{he came back to}} Ferrara in 1782 he held different positions at the University: he became professor of Physics, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Botany. He then wrote the Pharmacopoeia of Ferrara in 1797, several editions were published. It was also esteemed both in Italy and abroad till the end of the 19 th Century.

Writing in The New York Review of Books in 1985, Timothy Garton Ash said:When you show the 1930s as a golden age of prosperity and excitement in the German countryside, when you are shown the Germans as victims of the war, then you inevitably find yourself asking: But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side?

3000|$|After the {{occurrence}} of a disaster, it is natural to ask, who is responsible. In many cases, {{people are trying to}} find one person or organization (the ‘scapegoat’) to blame. In fact, after the Love Parade disaster, it seems that everybody was blaming everybody else: the visitors, the organizers, the police, the city of Duisburg. What makes things difficult is that nobody is totally right and nobody is totally wrong: in the following, we will argue that it is the interaction of many contributing factors that caused the crowd disaster. Before we discuss the interaction of these factors, however, let us shed more light on some of them in separation. While doing so, we will address a number of hypotheses regarding the cause of the crowd disaster, which have been formulated after the event. Given the many victims and pictures reminding of a war zone, some people first thought that a terrorist attack with explosives had happened. 118 <b>Others</b> claimed that <b>the</b> fatalities resulted, because some people had fallen on top of others when unsuccessfully trying to climb the stairs from the side or the billboard (see Figure 1). 119 And again <b>others</b> were blaming <b>the</b> crowd for the outbreak of a ‘mass panic’ (stampede) 120 or at least some people for improper behavior. 121 The first hypothesis was obviously not true.

Managed lanes provide a mechanism for harnessing the potential of the current infrastructure. Special-purpose lanes, including highoccupancy vehicle (HOV) and high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes, allow engineers to manipulate roadway parameters to achieve varying levels of service. Managed lanes are controlled access facilities, and must somehow be separated from general-purpose lanes. One principle question that must be asked is what type of delineation technique should be used? What are the properties of different delineators that make some more favorable than others? How do roadway characteristics, such as available width and traffic volume, factor into the choice of delineation? Much has been written on the safety and cost aspects of different delineation techniques used for HOV lanes; are these analyses applicable to other managed lanes as well? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> characteristics of the techniques: what are they, and how important are they to the choice of delineation?

This textometric and stylometric study establishes cliche densities for the stream-of-consciousness of each of these main characters, including Bloom, with startling results—Bloom and Gerty MacDowell speak from large repertoires of cliche, inviting us to read them naturalistically, which is to say comically and ironically, in this comic novel. Molly uses them far less, and emerges as a realistic character, one of substance and individuated voice compared to Bloom and Gerty. Stephen alone uses virtually none whatsoever. His language is almost entirely original, often unprecedented, and in accord with his project to escape the paralyzing culture, linguistic and otherwise, of Dublin.
