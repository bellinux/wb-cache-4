5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of our best science journalists.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, {{prior to}} his death, {{invested}} and arranged financial matters so that his heirs would avoid death duties. When his grandfather died, the newly titled 10th Earl of Shaftesbury came into a vast fortune of the Shaftesbury estates and other properties, including the family's 17th-century home and large estate in Dorset, as well as residences in Hove, London, Versailles and the French Riviera. Shaftesbury also inherited a collection of art, antiques, and other valuables worth over £3m. By the 1990s, {{the wealth of the}} family estate remained <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> millions.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his {{emphatic}} declaration that science is not technology, Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them {{are just trying to}} be good engineers. An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> having.|$|E
50|$|Feng Bingxian (born 1945) is a Chinese private {{property}} rights advocate. Feng sued the government of Shaanxi province, alleging the illegal seizure of oil <b>wells</b> <b>worth</b> over $850 million. Feng and his lawyer Zhu Jiuhu, along with 13 of the 15 plaintiffs, were arrested on July 26 for disturbing the peace, a significant setback {{for the rule of}} law and {{private property}} in China.|$|R

25|$|The depot of the company, {{which is}} a newly-erected {{building}} off Arkwright-street, is complete to the detail, the stables being capable of accommodating 50 or 60 horses. The rooms are lofty and well ventilated, and certainly the core of horses which we saw yesterday were <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> of the home which they now realise. A finer set of cattle it is scarcely possible to conceive, and cannot fail to win the admiration of the people.|$|E
25|$|Local {{folklore}} {{tells of}} the southern slopes of the Bump being festooned with grapevines, tended by the monks of the priory. The Bump can be climbed using the North Norfolk Coastal Path from either the east or west, and is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the climb. From the top, there are views of the surrounding land and sea. Each Easter, the combined churches in the area make a pilgrimage carrying a cross {{to the top of}} Beeston Bump, and an open-air service takes place.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{operating}} systems can have shared library {{files of the}} same format as the executable files. This offers two main advantages: first, it requires making only one loader for both of them, rather than two (having the single loader is considered <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> its added complexity). Secondly, it allows the executables also {{to be used as}} shared libraries, if they have a symbol table. Typical combined executable and shared library formats are ELF and Mach-O (both in Unix) and PE (Windows).|$|E

5|$|In March 2012 {{the first}} {{commercial}} oil well was drilled 70km off the Cork coast by Providence Resources. The Barryroe oil well is yielding 3500 barrels per day, at current oil prices at $120 a barrel Barryroe oil <b>well</b> is <b>worth</b> in excess of €2.14bn annually.|$|R
25|$|In February 2005, it was {{announced}} that the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) on the European Space Agency's Mars Express Orbiter had detected traces of formaldehyde in the atmosphere of Mars. Vittorio Formisano, the director of the PFS, has speculated that the formaldehyde could be the byproduct of the oxidation of methane and, according to him, would provide evidence that Mars is either extremely geologically active or harbouring colonies of microbial life. NASA scientists consider the preliminary findings <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> a follow-up, but have also rejected the claims of life.|$|E
25|$|The last {{section of}} Paston way is between Overstrand and Cromer. The route follows the {{coastline}} here although an {{alternative is to}} follow the coast road. This part of the coastline is reputed to be the stalking ground of Legendary hellhound Black Shuck. And so on to Cromer and the Parish Church of St Peter and Saint Paul. The tower {{of the church is}} 160ft high and is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> a visit and also marks the end of Paston Way. The path links with the North Norfolk Coastal Path/Peddars Way and the UK National Trails Network.|$|E
25|$|Solving such {{problems}} {{is actually an}} easy task and it is simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the data could become very tricky, but once it’s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped with the tools to record the trajectory information in binary format.|$|E

25|$|The {{programming}} of the {{stored program}} for ENIAC {{was done by}} Betty Jennings, Clippinger and Adele Goldstine. It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer on September 16, 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for John von Neumann. This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC {{by a factor of}} six and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time to hours instead of days, it was considered <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely I/O bound, even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.|$|E
25|$|His most {{important}} teacher was Jean Dorat. He was able {{not only to}} impart knowledge, but also to kindle enthusiasm in Scaliger. It was to Dorat that Scaliger owed his home for the next thirty years of his life, for in 1563 the professor recommended him to Louis de Chasteigner, the young lord of La Roche-Posay, as a companion in his travels. A close friendship sprang up between the two young men, which remained unbroken till the death of Louis in 1595. The travellers first went to Rome. Here they found Marc Antoine Muret, who, when at Bordeaux and Toulouse, had been a great favourite and occasional visitor of Julius Caesar Scaliger at Agen. Muret soon recognized the young Scaliger's merits, and introduced him to many contacts <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> knowing.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{widening}} project, the level-of-service along the highway went from an overall grade of 'F' (failing) to 'A' (excellent) and {{became one of the most}} scenic byways in the nation. The desire by the designers of the highway, the general public, and the numerous preservation organizations to maintain the historic character of the corridor and to maintain its unique character made the cost extraordinairly high but it was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the cost. Dry-laid limestone rock fences were dismantled and reconstructed by hand, for instance, and extensive landscaping and tree planting using native species were utilized. As {{a result of}} this careful construction, the Paris Pike project won a 2002 Merit-Design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects as well as the 2003 Federal Highway Administration's Environmental Excellence Award and the National Partnership for Highway Quality 2003 State Award.|$|E

25|$|There {{will be a}} lot {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas do not agree with the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E
25|$|The King {{knew that}} he had to take Paris if he stood any chance of ruling all of France. This, however, was no easy task. The Catholic League's presses and {{supporters}} continued to spread stories about atrocities committed against Catholic priests and the laity in Protestant England (see Forty Martyrs of England and Wales). The city prepared to fight to the death rather than accept a Calvinist king. The Battle of Ivry, fought on March 14, 1590, was another victory for the king, and Henry's forces went on to lay siege to Paris, but the siege was broken by Spanish support. Realising that his predecessor had been right {{and that there was no}} prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in Catholic Paris, Henry reputedly uttered the famous phrase Paris vaut bien une messe (Paris is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> a mass). He was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1593 and was crowned at Chartres in 1594.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, in November 1941, Duncan held a séance in Portsmouth {{at which}} she claimed the spirit materialization of a sailor told her HMS Barham had been sunk. Because {{the sinking of}} HMS Barham was revealed, in strict confidence, only to the {{relatives}} of casualties, and not announced to the public until late January 1942, the Navy started to {{take an interest in}} her activities. Two lieutenants were among her audience at a séance on 14 January 1944. One of these was a Lieutenant Worth who was not impressed as a white cloth figure had appeared behind the curtains claiming to be his aunt but he had no deceased aunt. In the same sitting another figure appeared claiming to be his sister but Worth replied his sister was alive and <b>well.</b> <b>Worth</b> was disgusted by the séance and reported it to the police. This was followed up on 19 January, when undercover policemen arrested her at another séance as a white-shrouded manifestation appeared. This proved to be Duncan herself, in a white cloth which she attempted to conceal when discovered, and she was arrested.|$|E
