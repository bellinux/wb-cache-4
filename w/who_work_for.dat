5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|Upsher and Doff: Upsher and Doff are {{a tabloid}} {{journalist}} and photographer, respectively, {{from the planet}} Jetsam, <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a tabloid called The Hebdomadal, and who are also lovers. First appearing in issue #13, their speech, like all people from Jetsam, is rendered {{in the form of}} blue text surrounded by speech balloons that more closely resemble traditional comics thought bubbles. Jetsam is a partially underwater society, as its natives possess an amphibious physiology, and are capable of surviving in and out of water. Upsher and Doff experience more than one confrontation with Freelancers hired {{to put an end to}} their investigation. The Brand poisons them with embargon, a substance that will kill them if they report their findings about the family to anyone else, though they attempt to find a way around this in order to continue their investigation. After they learn The Brand is dead, they attempt to resume their investigation, but are confronted by The Will, who drafts them into his service.|$|E
