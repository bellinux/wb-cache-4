Portland's main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> and many rail lines were forced to shut down. In 1894, another major flood occurred on the Willamette, and although it too caused huge damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.|$|E
5|$|In December 1945, Hōshōs {{overhanging}} {{flight deck}} at the bow <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and her hangars were modified to carry more passengers. Thereafter, she undertook more repatriation missions beginning with one to Wewak on 5 January 1946 and subsequent trips to China. In total, the carrier made nine repatriation trips before 15 August 1946 and transported about 40,000 passengers.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of African Americans were {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in the Deep South. The revived Ku Klux Klan committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E

5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from the rest of Germany.|$|E
5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E
5|$|Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, {{which were}} {{designated}} the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies {{of oil and}} other important raw materials. This formed {{part of an effort}} to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.|$|E
25|$|Positions with doubled pawns {{are usually}} a draw if the {{defending}} king {{can get in}} front of the pawns.

5|$|Damage was {{widespread}} in the Philippines, particularly in Metro Manila, where the typhoon passed almost directly over. Power and water was lost in several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In {{some parts of the}} country, electricity <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> for up to six days straight. Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while Luzon suffered an island-wide power outage. Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and Bicol Region. Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila since Typhoon Angela passed over the city eleven years ago.|$|E
5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E

5|$|Lundy {{was granted}} to the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1160. The Templars were a major {{international}} maritime force at this time, with interests in North Devon, and almost certainly an important port at Bideford or on the River Taw in Barnstaple. This was probably because of the increasing threat posed by the Norse sea raiders; however, {{it is unclear whether}} they ever took possession of the island. Ownership was disputed by the Marisco family who may have already been on the island during King Stephen's reign. The Mariscos were fined, and the island <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from necessary supplies. Evidence of the Templars' weak hold on the island came when King John, on his accession in 1199, confirmed the earlier grant.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{outbreak}} of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces, recently engaged in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India. Only Pondicherry was able to resist, and a siege was instigated on 1 August 1793 by Colonel John Braithwaite while Cornwallis imposed a naval blockade. British forces constructed trenches and batteries, often under heavy fire, over the following weeks. Twenty days after the city <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> Braithwaite began a bombardment of the defences. Within hours the French commander Colonel Prosper de Clermont requested a truce, followed the next morning by an unconditional surrender.|$|E

5|$|Peninsula-wide, a {{total of}} 534transmission towers and 700,963telephone poles were downed; both these totals {{exceeded}} the totals of Hurricane Manuel and Hurricane Wilma. Consequently, at least 239,000people were left without electricity throughout Baja California Sur alone, equal to around 92%of the state's population. All access to drinking water across Baja California Sur <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> About 30%of all crops on the peninsula were destroyed. Odile inflicted damage on 10,000homes, including 1,800of which were destroyed. The majority of hotels along the southern portion of the state sustained minor damage. At least 479schools in the southern portion of the peninsula were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{affecting}} Guerrero, Hurricane Calvin {{was responsible}} for heavy rains and widespread flooding across Oaxaca. An estimated 7,000 were left homeless along the Oaxacan coast and on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. In addition, travel from the isthmus <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> due to mudslides that blocked portions of the Pan-American Highway. Two rivers threatened to overflow their banks while the Benito, Juarez, and Yosocuta dams attained peak capacity and thus the gates were opened to prevent overflowing. A total of 42 communities were flooded. The cities of Tehuantepec, Salina Cruz, Juchtianm, and Tuxtepec were flooded due to extended periods of torrential rains. Across the state, the rains blocked highways and knocked out electrical, telephone, and water services. About 3,000people took refuge to shelters and one person was killed.|$|E
5|$|Quickly {{accelerating}} northwards, Helene made landfall on Newfoundland late on September29. Rainfall {{peaked at}} 3.05in (77.5mm) in northern {{parts of the}} island, while rainfall amounts were generally minimal across the Avalon Peninsula. A weather station in Naval Station Argentia reported maximum sustained winds of 60mph (100km/h) and a gust of 82mph (132km/h). The winds severed communications in southwestern Newfoundland and cut communications in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from the mainland. Bell Island <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> {{from the rest of}} Newfoundland due to rough seas generated by Helene, which resulted in the destruction of piers and lack of boat service.
