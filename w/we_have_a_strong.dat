500|$|The studio New Line Cinema {{released}} Surf Ninjas {{two weeks}} earlier than its commercial release date in Evansville, Indiana and Lubbock, Texas {{as part of a}} test of regional markets. The early release marked {{the first time that a}} major film was released in Evansville before its national opening without any local ties. The president of theatrical marketing at New Line, Chris Pula, selected Evansville for its family-oriented audiences. Pula explained: [...] "Evansville is traditionally a strong family market. Also, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> relationship with the exhibitors in that area". The president said that the studio was testing the film in a larger market than usual due to its uncertainty about the film's reception, and that the studio would measure its marketing success with ticket receipts.|$|E
500|$|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem was {{developed}} {{exclusively for the}} PSP. Regarding PSP exclusivity, Rebellion lead designer Tim Jones explained [...] "It was basically a matter of logistics. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> heritage with the PSP and have done a number of successful titles such as [...] ". Rebellion decided to forego the first-person shooter format of their earlier Alien vs. Predator games and instead focused on a third-person perspective, with the player taking {{the role of a}} lone Predator. Unlike previous Rebellion Alien vs. Predator titles, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem does not permit players to take the role of Aliens or human Marines. The company used a game engine of its own creation, and Hal Zabie, associate producer at Sierra Entertainment, said [...] "...the challenge was to deliver high quality graphics while not sacrificing game performance {{and this is something that}} Rebellion achieved and will be noticed by players right away." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E

During {{what was supposed to}} be a routine joint press conference in Boise, Idaho by the governors of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in which the three touted the benefits of energy conservation, Ray reacted with barely concealed disdain to Oregon governor Robert W. Straub's call for legislation to encourage the installation of home insulation. [...] "I don't believe our citizens are lax, or lazy, or indifferent," [...] Ray fired.

60|$|Here <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{case for}} {{applying}} either the licensing system or whatever better means may be devized for securing the orderly conduct of houses of public entertainment, dramatic or other. Liberty must, no doubt, be respected {{in so far}} that no manager {{should have the right}} to refuse admission to decently dressed, sober, and well-conducted persons, whether they are prostitutes, soldiers in uniform, gentlemen not in evening dress, Indians, or what not; but when disorder is stopped, disorderly persons will either cease to come or else reform their manners. It is, however, quite arguable that the indiscriminate issue of free admissions, though an apparently innocent and good- natured, and certainly a highly popular proceeding, should expose the proprietor of the theatre to the risk of a refusal to renew his licence.|$|E

We shall offer to submit ourselves to his mercy if he will have pity on the city. If he demands the entire mastership we shall fight in earnest.

"When {{the king}} {{advances}} next spring with his great army, Sir Archie, I will assuredly adopt the course which you point out, seeing {{that we could}} not hope to withstand so great an array in a pitched battle; but the case is different now. In the first place all the castles and towns {{are in the hands of}} the English, and from them Pembroke can draw such provision as he needs. In the second place his force is not so superior to our own but that we may fight him with a fair hope of victory; and whereas Wallace had never any cavalry with him, save at Falkirk when they deserted him at the beginning of the battle, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> body of mounted men-at-arms, the retainers of the nobles with me, therefore I do not fear to give them battle in the open field." ...|$|E

Besides, I have a brother in the garrison there, so that altogether I shall be your debtor. You see, we are not allowed to ride beyond St. Ambrogio, or Rivoli at farthest, for once beyond that, we should be liable to be caught by the enemy's scouting parties. Of course <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> force at Rivoli, but except to drive off small parties of the enemy who may venture to come up too close, they are forbidden to engage in any affairs. It is annoying, but one can understand that the general is anxious to avoid encounters in which the enemy is sure to be superior in force, until his reinforcements come up and we are able to take the field in earnest." ...|$|E

His father is the best draughtsman in Scotland, and the lad himself shows a great deal of talent both in science and the ordinary branches of learning. I enclose a note of the youth's age, studies, and progress, in case your Grace might think it possible to place on your list for the Engineer service the name of a poor Scots Hidalgo; your Grace knows Scotland is a breeding not a feeding country, and we must send our sons abroad, as we send our black cattle to England; and, as old Lady Campbell of Ardkinglas proposed to dispose of her nine sons, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> tendency to put our young folks 'a' to the sword.' ...|$|E
