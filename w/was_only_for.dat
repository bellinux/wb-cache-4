5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) or whether it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Worsley found {{a command}} in the Merchant Navy, and, giving his age as 64 (he was {{actually}} 69), was appointed {{master of the}} Dalriada in August 1941. He worked to keep the harbour entrance at Sheerness clear of wrecked shipping and also carried out salvage work. His command <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> a few months for when the company that owned his vessel found out his true age, he was replaced. Unhappy at being put into the Merchant Navy Reserve Pool, he continued to advocate for a useful posting.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} not given {{boarding}} passes for Flight11 in Portland, Atta and Omari checked in and went through security in Boston. In the rushed check-in after the flight from Portland, airline officials did not load Atta's bags on Flight11. Suqami, Wail al-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri also checked in for the flight in Boston. Wail al-Shehri and Suqami each checked one bag; Waleed al-Shehri did not check any bags. CAPPS selected all three for a detailed luggage check. As the CAPPS' screening <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{call for}} an end to the use of Native American mascots <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> {{non-native}} schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors.|$|E

5|$|Thuppakkis {{first look}} poster was leaked on the {{internet}} on 30 April 2012, a day prior to its scheduled release on 1 May. The poster, that depicted Vijay holding a cigar in his mouth, was criticised by social activists for violating the Indian Tobacco Act, which prohibits advertising tobacco products.

5|$|Wail al-Shehri, {{his brother}} Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived {{together}} at Logan Airport at 06:45 {{on the morning}} of September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint. One of the five Globe Aviation security screeners on-duty later reported that either Wail or Waleed had been using a crutch when they passed through security, and that the crutch had been X-rayed as per regulations.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E

5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered {{by people who}} thought that animation <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt. Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's cartoon and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with high interest, but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it Cartoon Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first to by-pass a seven-minute short.|$|E
5|$|Between 1927 and 1933 {{multiple}} unit compartment stock {{was built by}} the Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon and Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The first order <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> motor cars; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the motor cars working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the motor cars had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes, and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' stock was ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the 'MV' units, but with Westinghouse brakes. A further batch of 'MW' stock was ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase {{the length of the}} previous 'MW' batch trains to eight coaches. These had GEC WT545 motors, and although designed to work in multiple with the MV153, this did not work well in practice. After the Met became part of London Underground, the MV stock was fitted with Westinghouse brakes and the cars with GEC motors were re-geared to allow them to work in multiple with the MV153-motored cars. In 1938, nine 8-coach and ten 6-coach MW units were re-designated T Stock. A trailer coach built in 1904/5 is stored at London Transport Museum's Acton Depot, although it has been badly damaged by fire, and the Spa Valley Railway is home to two T stock coaches.|$|E
5|$|By August 1977, discussions {{had been}} held with the main cast from The Original Series, {{as well as some}} of the actors who had played {{recurring}} characters. While none had been signed at the time, Roddenberry expressed confidence that they could do so with the exception of Leonard Nimoy, who had stated that he would not return to television. However, Nimoy said separately that the first offer he received from Roddenberry for Phase II <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the pilot and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes that followed, which he rejected. Nimoy and Roddenberry were not on good terms, following a legal suit launched by the actor against Paramount over merchandising rights featuring his likeness; Roddenberry had refused to support Nimoy in the case. There was also a problem with the return of William Shatner: owing to the pay he was to receive for the pilot and the first thirteen episodes, the network wanted a contingency plan to replace him afterwards. Shatner was aware at the time that the plan was either to reduce his appearances after the initial episodes and reduce his ongoing fees, or to kill off the character permanently if he refused the pay cut. Negotiations began with Shatner on June 10, but it was not until September 12 that his return was announced.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, damaged {{buildings}} polluted {{rivers in}} South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000soldiers {{to assist in}} cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies {{were sent to the}} affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49million in donations (₩58billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680meals to 16,919families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60million (₩72.1billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September13, the South Korean government declared 203cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69houses for storm victims in 2003, although that <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> {{a small portion of the}} overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74billion in damage and 117deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.|$|E
5|$|Like the FIFA World Cup, the Recopa Sudamericana is {{sponsored}} {{by a group of}} multinational corporations. Unlike the premier football tournament forementioned, the competition uses a single, main sponsor; it is currently primarily sponsored by Banco Santander, one of the largest banks in the world. The deal running for a period of three years began with the 2012 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition will carry the name of the bank. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Santander Libertadores'". The first primary sponsor of the competition was Fox Sports Latinoamérica, a Latin American cable television network focusing on sports-related programming including live and pre-recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, and other original programmings. The sponsorship <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the 2005 edition of the competition, being known officially as '"Fox Sports Recopa Sudamericana"'. The second primary sponsor was Visa, an American multinational financial services corporation. The deal ran for a period of 3 years which began with the 2006 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition carried the name of the corporation. Thus, the competition was known officially as '"Recopa Visa Sudamericana"'.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{won their}} first League {{championship}} in 1901. Integral {{to their success}} were their captain Alex Raisbeck, and striker Sam Raybould. Raisbeck, a centre-half, had been signed from Hibernian in 1898. He became club captain a year later, and was often {{the focal point of}} the team, as an important defensive player and the instigator of many of Liverpool's attacks. Raybould was signed from local club New Brighton Tower, and in the 1899–1900 season scored seven times as the club won nine of their last eleven matches, to finish in tenth place. He would go on to score 128 goals in 226 matches for Liverpool. Success in the 1900–01 season looked unlikely in February, at which point Liverpool had lost eight games and conceded 31 goals. However, they won nine and drew three of their next twelve matches, while only conceding four goals, to achieve their first League title. They were less successful in the following two seasons, finishing in eleventh and fifth places respectively. The 1903–04 season saw the club relegated to the Second Division; like the previous relegation it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> one year as they won the division the following season. On their return in the 1905–06 season they became the first team to win the Second and First Division in successive seasons. They also reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, where they faced Everton and lost 2–0.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly won a {{scholarship}} to the Sydney Teachers College at Sydney University, to train as a schoolmaster. However, the financial assistance <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> two years and merely sufficient for O'Reilly's rent at Glebe Point. When he was in Sydney, O'Reilly received an invitation to join an athletics club based on his performances in Goulburn, but was only able to join after the secretary Dick Corish waived his membership fee. Jumping 47feet, he came second in a triple jump competition behind Nick Winter, {{who went on to}} win gold in the event at the 1924 Summer Olympics with a world record of 50ft. O'Reilly also placed second in a high jumping competition, clearing six feet. Corish was also a cricket administrator and invited O'Reilly to play in a David Jones Second XI. Not knowing anything of his new recruit's abilities, Corish did not allow O'Reilly to bowl until he explicitly complained of only being allowed to field. O'Reilly promptly finished off the opposition's innings by removing the middle and lower order. After an encounter with journalist Johnny Moyes, who wrote glowingly about O'Reilly's skills.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Second World War, Johnston was a slow-medium and left-arm {{orthodox}} spin bowler, {{but during}} a practice session, he bowled a quicker ball to Jack Ryder a former Australian captain and Test batsman, {{who was now}} a Victorian and national selector. This prompted Ryder to wage a personal campaign to induce Johnston to become a pace bowler. At the same time, Richmond captain Jack Ledward wanted him to bowl spin. Upon the resumption of first-class cricket in 1945–46, Johnston made his first-class debut against Queensland and was entrusted with the responsibility of opening the attack. His maiden wicket was that of leading Test batsman Bill Brown. Johnston took a total of 1/84 in a ten-wicket win. He felt that the fast bowling <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> short periods with the new ball, {{and that he would}} be allowed to revert to spin bowling as the ball became older. He played a total of seven matches for the season and took 12 wickets at 35.08, with his best performance being 4/43 against arch-rivals New South Wales. As a result, he missed the national selection for the tour to New Zealand.|$|E
