5|$|Steam <b>Whistle</b> – An {{industrial}} steam <b>whistle</b> {{has been}} present on Georgia Tech's campus {{ever since the}} early industrial shop years. It typically was blown for the change of classes at five minutes before the hour. On football game days, the <b>whistle</b> is blown after every Yellow Jackets' score, and again after every Yellow Jackets' victory.|$|E
5|$|Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, {{known as}} When the <b>Whistle</b> Blows, to honor students, staff, and faculty who {{died during the}} {{previous}} year. The Georgia Tech <b>Whistle</b> is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died. A procession of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker's stage.|$|E

5000|$|The brown-winged <b>whistling</b> thrush (Myophonus castaneus), {{also known}} as the Sumatran <b>whistling</b> thrush or chestnut-winged <b>whistling</b> thrush, is a {{passerine}} bird belonging to the <b>whistling</b> thrush genus Myophonus in the family Muscicapidae. It is endemic to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. In the past, it has often been lumped together with the Javan <b>whistling</b> thrush (M. glaucinus) and Bornean <b>whistling</b> thrush (M. borneensis) as the [...] "Sunda <b>whistling</b> thrush" [...] (M. glaucinus) but it is now often regarded as a separate species based on differences in plumage and measurements.|$|R
5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long call is heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The short call is a harsh, sharp <b>whistle</b> that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched <b>whistle</b> {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm call is given out immediately any danger from predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E
5|$|Vocalizations of the pygmy slow loris {{include a}} short <b>whistle,</b> mother-infant contact calls, and a {{whistling}} sound produced during estrus.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's <b>whistle</b> blew for an infringement.

However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E

25|$|Different <b>whistling</b> styles {{may be used}} in {{a single}} language. Sochiapam Chinantec has three {{different}} words for whistle-speech: sie3 for <b>whistling</b> with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, jui̵32 for bilabial <b>whistling,</b> and juo2 for finger-in-the-mouth <b>whistling.</b> These are used for communication over varying distances. There is also a kind of loud falsetto (hóh32) which functions in some ways like <b>whistled</b> speech.|$|R

5|$|A study {{conducted}} by the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they'd lived with after 20 years of separation.

50|$|<b>Whistling</b> ducks {{were first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758: the black-bellied <b>whistling</b> duck (then Anas autumnalis) and the West Indian <b>whistling</b> duck (then Anas arborea). In 1837, William John Swainson named the genus Dendrocygna to distinguish <b>whistling</b> ducks {{from the other}} waterfowl. The type species was listed as the wandering <b>whistling</b> duck (D. arcuata), formerly named by Thomas Horsfield as Anas arcuata.|$|R

5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will <b>whistle</b> on the owner's approach; they will also learn to <b>whistle</b> {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Whistled</b> {{languages}} use <b>whistling</b> {{to emulate}} speech and facilitate communication. A <b>whistled</b> {{language is a}} system of <b>whistled</b> communication which allows fluent whistlers to transmit and comprehend a potentially unlimited number of messages over long distances. <b>Whistled</b> languages are different in this respect from the restricted codes sometimes used by herders or animal trainers to transmit simple messages or instructions. [...] Generally, <b>whistled</b> languages emulate the tones or vowel formants of a natural spoken language, as well as aspects of its intonation and prosody, so that trained listeners who speak that language can understand the encoded message.|$|R

5|$|Sounds and {{gestures}} help {{keep track of}} other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature <b>whistle).</b>|$|E
5|$|The final <b>whistle</b> blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final <b>whistle,</b> who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to the dressing room.|$|E
