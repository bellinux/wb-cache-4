50|$|A pop filter {{differs from}} a {{microphone}} <b>windscreen.</b> Pop filters <b>are</b> generally {{used in a}} studio environment, while <b>windscreens</b> <b>are</b> typically used outdoors. <b>Windscreens</b> <b>are</b> also used by vocalists on stage to reduce plosives and saliva, though {{they may not be}} as acoustically transparent as a studio pop filter.|$|R
50|$|Armoured <b>windscreens</b> <b>were</b> fitted, {{along with}} {{hydraulic}} wipers.|$|R

50|$|The Harrington Legionnaire was a square-rigged {{body with}} {{straight}} waistrail and five deep windows per side. It also {{differed from the}} Harrington Cavalier and Harrington Grenadier by having plated window surrounds, {{there was a large}} brightwork grille and twin headlights, a Harrington Grenadier-style front <b>windscreen</b> <b>was</b> used with a similar sized one at the rear. Above the <b>windscreen</b> <b>was</b> a destination box of illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak.|$|R

50|$|The {{front end}} of the Mark III was largely the same as the Mark II, {{although}} the illuminated panel or destination display below the <b>windscreen</b> <b>was</b> squared off and given a chrome surround. Also, pantograph <b>windscreen</b> wipers <b>were</b> introduced, although some early Mark IIIs had the older type.|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} {{encountered in}} the use of a rotating arm for the generation of wind to test microphone <b>windscreens</b> <b>are</b> presented. Tests on various windscreens of cylindrical and spherical shape, composed of single and multiple sections, indicate that the most effective <b>windscreens</b> <b>are</b> those constructed of several layers of separated sheer nylon cloth. The supporting framework for the cloth as well as the cloth itself, have a marked effect on both the reduction of wind noise and on the attenuation of the desired sound...|$|R

50|$|The <b>windscreen</b> <b>was</b> {{made from}} heat {{reflecting}} glass. All windows were electrically operates with additional controls for the driver. The roof had a transparent panel with an internal shutter.|$|R
50|$|Originally a tall, {{wrap-around}} {{lower deck}} <b>windscreen</b> <b>was</b> fitted, but some batches were {{fitted with a}} double-curvature windscreen on the upper deck with either a straight or an arched top.|$|R

50|$|The three-seat, full steel {{cabin is}} heat and sound insulated, and the {{interior}} is fully upholstered. The two-piece <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> curved and made from laminated glass. The driver's seat can be adjusted vertically and horizontally, and it is sprung and damped. The heater fan is two-speed and the nozzles <b>are</b> located at <b>windscreen,</b> legroom and {{both ends of the}} dashboard. The <b>windscreen</b> wipers <b>are</b> with separate motors.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{truck had}} a split, flat pane windshield {{which is still}} available for certain versions, although since December 1994 the T600's cab using a curved <b>windscreen</b> <b>was</b> added to the lineup. Originally it was only for the long Aerocab and also as an option on the daycab, and it only became available for the W900S in 2006. The flat <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> not available on the Aerocab or the extended daycab versions. Strangely, Kenworth offers the curved window either as a one-piece or as a two-piece with a divider in the middle. In March 1998 the very comfortable Studio Aerocab model was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Heated rear <b>windscreens</b> <b>were</b> now {{standard}} on all but base model sedans, panel vans and wagons. Nylon plaid cloth inserts available on SL's and wagons, air conditioning was now available as an optional accessory.|$|R
5000|$|The D.7 was a {{conventionally}} laid-out monoplane, {{with a thick}} cantilever shoulder wing. Its single seat, open cockpit, {{provided with}} a small <b>windscreen,</b> <b>was</b> over the wing. It had conventional, fixed, tailskid landing gear.|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{legislation}} of periodical vehicle inspection, <b>windscreens</b> <b>are</b> examined to see if they fulfil the specifications. Damage to windscreens can cause a decrease of vision and/or crack. On parking places 840 cars were studied at random for such damage. The number of laminated glass windscreens has increased much over the last few years. In 1976 / 1977 only 13 % of <b>windscreens</b> <b>were</b> of laminated glass. In 1986 the percentage was already 71 %. Only 5 cars had a crack in the windscreen but in none of these cases was there a real visual hindrance. In the strict application of the current interpretation of the specifications of vehicle inspection more <b>windscreens</b> will <b>be</b> condemned than is really necessary. The presence of cracks in laminated windscreens will generally not lead to sudden visual hindrance. The specifications should therefore be modified...|$|R
5000|$|... "Wrap-Round" [...] <b>windscreens</b> <b>were</b> {{a feature}} that was also seen on the [...] "Glasgow Blue Train" [...] Class 303 and 311 {{electric}} units; plus the GE line's 309s and the WCML's 310s, although these were later modified to cut replacement costs.|$|R
50|$|The dome design {{ensures that}} the dome {{provides}} sufficient ventilation for the telescope not to be limited by dome seeing. For this the dome is also equipped with louvers, whereby the <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> designed {{to allow them to}} fulfill their function.|$|R
50|$|There are no tolls {{for using}} the {{motorways}} in Romania, except Cernavodă Bridge over the Danube on the A2. Nevertheless, every car that uses a motorway or a national road in Romania must wear a sticker called a rovinietă on its <b>windscreen,</b> which can <b>be</b> bought at larger petrol stations.Since a few years rovinieta is electronic, meaning that the sticker on the <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> no longer mandatory.|$|R

The front <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> shared with the standard van along with the mechanical components.|$|R
50|$|The body is moulded in {{high quality}} glass {{reinforced}} plastic. It is extremely tough, non rusting and, being unstressed, {{is not subject}} to gel-coat star crazing as found on many cars using GRP body shells. The <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> laminated glass and the rear screen perspex.|$|R
50|$|The Basettino had a {{hexagonal}} section, plywood covered nacelle, with curved {{upper and}} lower surfaces. A deep, rubber sprung, wooden landing skid on most of its underside formed its undercarriage. The pilot's cockpit, comfortable though open and without a <b>windscreen,</b> <b>was</b> placed below the wing leading edge.|$|R
50|$|WZ-523s have {{relatively}} good range and payload, and may seat {{up to ten}} passengers who enter and debus from a single door in the rear hull. The vehicle has a long, boat-shaped hull with a trim vane mounted on the glacis plate. It is fully amphibious once this vane is raised, being propelled at speeds of up to 7 km by two water jets at the rear. A two-piece <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> provided for the driver and a passenger seated to his right. During combat, the <b>windscreen</b> may <b>be</b> covered by hinged armored shutters.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the station}} was rehabilitated with funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Four {{laminated}} glass windscreens by artist Amy Cheng, commissioned by the MTA Arts for Transit Program, was installed in July 2012. The <b>windscreens</b> <b>were</b> fabricated by Depp Glass, based in Long Island City, Queens.|$|R
5000|$|Car 101 and 115 were {{installed}} with solar windscreen {{on one of}} the car ends each. This was to minimize heat and light from entering the trains, which were one of the main causes for warmer trains. The experimental <b>windscreens</b> <b>were</b> successful as they were subsequently rolled out to other train cars.|$|R
50|$|The saloon's <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> V-shaped. The {{side windows}} have two sliding panels, two winding panels and fixed panels {{at the rear}} of the six-light body. The Weymann saloon's front seat is slidable by hand. The spare wheel is carried at the back of the body in front of the folding luggage grid.|$|R
5000|$|Kangaroos {{dazzled by}} {{headlights}} or startled by engine noise often leap {{in front of}} vehicles, severely damaging or destroying smaller or unprotected vehicles. The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the <b>windscreen</b> <b>is</b> the point of impact. As a result, [...] "kangaroo crossing" [...] signs are commonplace in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|A flatter A-pillar's {{advantages}} include {{reducing the}} overall drag coefficient {{and making the}} car body stronger in a frontal collision, {{at the expense of}} reducing driver visibility in a 180° field of view from left to right. A flatter A-pillar (and therefore <b>windscreen)</b> <b>is</b> also a factor when calculating the effects of a collision with a pedestrian. In general a flatter angle will result in a more gentle impact, directing the pedestrian [...] "up and over" [...] rather than directly into the <b>windscreen.</b> This <b>is</b> particularly true for cars like the Mercedes-Benz A-Class which also have a low angled engine cover.|$|R
50|$|Another {{significant}} change comparing to EU07 series was exchange of traction motors to newer EE541g type with higher isolation class. <b>Windscreens</b> <b>were</b> changed to 14 mm thick ones with heating layer and pneumatic wipers. However, some solutions from EU07 locomotives which were rather faulty, were copied into this machines, like poor access to internal devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{cabin is}} made from steel and glass fibre and its top is detachable. All windows are made from safety glass and the side windows {{as well as the}} <b>windscreen</b> <b>are</b> openable. There are seats for driver and two passengers; the driver's seat is adjustable. The gauge panel is comprehensive, {{including}} a revolution counter.|$|R
50|$|The <b>windscreen</b> <b>was</b> {{recovered}} {{in a field}} outside Didcot, Oxfordshire by officers from Thames Valley Police. With earlier officers having not searched for or collected the bolts from the site, PC Tony Nash returned to the site and located {{a number of the}} windscreen bolts that assisted in determining the cause of the incident.|$|R
