5|$|Baleen <b>whales</b> (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} <b>whales,</b> form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (<b>whales,</b> dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right <b>whales),</b> Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen <b>whales</b> split from toothed <b>whales</b> (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Baleen <b>whales</b> are {{cetaceans}} classified {{under the}} parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right <b>whales),</b> Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray <b>whales</b> generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (<b>whales,</b> dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen <b>whales</b> are toothed <b>whales</b> both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Blue <b>whales</b> may be {{encountered}} (but rarely) on whale-watching cruises in the Gulf of Maine and are {{the main}} attractions along {{the north shore of}} the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and in the Saint Lawrence estuary. Blue <b>whales</b> can also be seen off Southern California, starting as early as March and April, with the peak between July and September. More <b>whales</b> have been observed close to shore along with fin <b>whales.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sea {{supports}} many <b>whale</b> species {{including the}} beluga, humpback <b>whale,</b> bowhead <b>whale,</b> gray <b>whale</b> and blue <b>whale,</b> the vulnerable sperm <b>whale,</b> and the endangered fin <b>whale,</b> sei <b>whale</b> and the rarest in the world, the North Pacific right <b>whale.</b> Other marine mammals include walrus, Steller sea lion, northern fur seal, orca and polar bear.|$|R
50|$|Off the {{northern}} and eastern coasts, aquatic mammals include grey seal, harp seal, hooded seal, ringed seal, sperm <b>whale,</b> orca, Atlantic pilot <b>whale,</b> fin <b>whale,</b> blue <b>whale,</b> northern right <b>whale,</b> bowhead <b>whale,</b> and humpback <b>whale.</b>|$|R
50|$|B. arnuxii {{is known}} as Arnoux's beaked <b>whale,</b> {{southern}} four-toothed <b>whale,</b> southern beaked <b>whale,</b> New Zealand beaked <b>whale,</b> southern giant bottlenose <b>whale,</b> and southern porpoise <b>whale.</b>|$|R
5|$|Captive <b>whales</b> have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire {{on behalf of the}} <b>whales</b> to communicate with humans, as <b>whales</b> have a very different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt <b>whales</b> in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm <b>whales</b> and right <b>whales,</b> with catches of up to 39,000 right <b>whales</b> by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right <b>whales,</b> sperm <b>whales,</b> which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead <b>whales,</b> which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke <b>whales,</b> blue <b>whales,</b> and grey <b>whales.</b> The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{fish species}} in Massachusetts include bass, carp, catfish, and trout, while {{saltwater}} {{species such as}} Atlantic cod, haddock, and American lobster populate offshore waters. Other marine species include Harbor seals, the endangered North Atlantic right <b>whales,</b> as well as humpback <b>whales,</b> fin <b>whales,</b> minke <b>whales,</b> and Atlantic white-sided dolphins.|$|E
50|$|B. bairdii {{is known}} as Baird's beaked <b>whale,</b> {{northern}} giant bottlenose <b>whale,</b> North Pacific bottlenose <b>whale,</b> giant four-toothed <b>whale,</b> northern four-toothed <b>whale,</b> and North Pacific four-toothed <b>whale.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Cameroon, a {{range of}} {{cetacean}} species such as humpback <b>whale,</b> right <b>whale,</b> sperm <b>whale,</b> fin <b>whale,</b> sei <b>whale,</b> killer <b>whale,</b> and dolphins are reported {{on the coast of}} the Atlantic Ocean. The African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) is also present.|$|R

5|$|Humpback <b>whales</b> {{have been}} sighted {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good {{locations}} to see humpback <b>whales</b> {{from a safe distance}} of about a quarter mile. Other marine <b>whales</b> sighted are grey, minke, fin, and killer <b>whales</b> (orcas).|$|E
5|$|Hunting large <b>whales</b> {{usually takes}} several hours. Killer <b>whales</b> {{generally}} choose to attack young or weak animals; however, {{a group of}} five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm <b>whales</b> sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm <b>whales.</b> Adult bull sperm <b>whales,</b> which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue <b>whales,</b> which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer <b>whales.</b>|$|E
5|$|Killer <b>whales</b> {{are very}} {{sophisticated}} and effective predators of marine mammals. Thirty-two cetacean {{species have been}} recorded as prey, from observing orcas' feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke <b>whales,</b> gray <b>whales,</b> and rarely sperm <b>whales</b> or blue <b>whales.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right <b>whale,</b> the blue <b>whale,</b> the fin <b>whale,</b> and the Sei <b>whale),</b> and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's <b>whale,</b> Eden's <b>whale,</b> Omura's <b>whale,</b> Southern minke <b>whale,</b> and pygmy right <b>whale).</b> Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|R

5|$|Pilot <b>whales</b> {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot <b>whales</b> were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 <b>whales</b> {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 <b>whales</b> caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Pilot <b>whales</b> {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned pilot <b>whales.</b> For short-finned pilot <b>whales</b> of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned pilot <b>whales,</b> gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot <b>whales</b> have a 15-month gestation period.|$|E
5|$|The <b>whales</b> {{are part}} of the largely {{terrestrial}} mammalian clade Laurasiatheria. <b>Whales</b> do not form a clade or order; the infraorder Cetacea includes dolphins and porpoises, which are not considered <b>whales.</b>|$|E

50|$|Gray's beaked <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon grayi), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Haast's beaked <b>whale,</b> the Scamperdown <b>whale,</b> or the southern beaked <b>whale,</b> {{is one of}} the better-known members of the genus Mesoplodon. This species is fairly gregarious and strands relatively frequently for a beaked <b>whale.</b> It is notable for being the only beaked <b>whale,</b> other than Shepherd's beaked <b>whale</b> (not a mesoplodont), that has upper teeth. In the Māori language, this species is called hakurā or iheihe.|$|R
40|$|This report summarises design-based {{estimates}} of abundance for those cetacean species for which sufficient {{data were obtained}} during SCANS-III: harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, white-beaked dolphin, white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, striped dolphin, pilot <b>whale,</b> all beaked <b>whale</b> species combined, sperm <b>whale,</b> minke <b>whale</b> and fin <b>whale...</b>|$|R
5|$|Unlike other <b>whales</b> (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} the males. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is usually reversed, with the males being larger, but the females of all baleen <b>whales</b> are usually five percent larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed through whale song, notably in humpback <b>whales</b> where the males of the species sing elaborate songs. Male right <b>whales</b> have bigger callosities than female right <b>whales.</b> The males are generally more scarred than females which {{is thought to be}} because of aggression during mating season.|$|E
5|$|Whale-watching, principally blue <b>whales,</b> is {{also carried}} out south of Sri Lanka. <b>Whales</b> are widely seen {{along the coast}} of Chile and Peru near the coast, {{occasionally}} making mixed groups with fin, sei, and Bryde's <b>whales.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Whales</b> are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. <b>Whales,</b> dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of <b>whales,</b> baleen <b>whales</b> (Mysticeti) and toothed <b>whales</b> (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The <b>whales</b> comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right <b>whales),</b> Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked <b>whales).</b>|$|E
50|$|The step movers are {{the white}} <b>whale,</b> porpoise, humpback, narwhal, blue <b>whale</b> and killer <b>whale.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Canary Islands it is {{possible}} to see these and others, such as the blue <b>whale,</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> beaked <b>whale,</b> false killer <b>whale,</b> Risso's dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin and rough-toothed dolphin.|$|R
50|$|The park's {{waters are}} {{also home to}} four species of whales: the blue <b>whale,</b> the fin <b>whale,</b> the minke <b>whale</b> and the beluga <b>whale.</b> Due to {{pollution}} on the Saguenay river, the beluga <b>whale</b> population has significantly decreased in the region. This subpopulation is now considered to be endangered.|$|R
5|$|<b>Whales</b> {{can also}} be {{threatened}} by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in <b>whales</b> and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include beaked <b>whales.</b> <b>Whales</b> are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed <b>whales</b> as they are higher up the food chain than baleen <b>whales.</b> Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They {{can also be}} poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some <b>whales.</b> Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such <b>whales</b> have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Whales</b> {{split into}} two {{separate}} parvorders around 34 mya– the baleen <b>whales</b> (Mysticetes) and the toothed <b>whales</b> (Odontocetes).|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that sperm <b>whales</b> sleep in {{vertical}} postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which <b>whales</b> {{do not respond to}} passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that <b>whales</b> possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
50|$|The minke <b>whale</b> , {{or lesser}} rorqual, is type of baleen <b>whale.</b> The {{two species of}} minke <b>whale</b> are the common (or northern) mink <b>whale</b> and the Antarctic (or southern) minke <b>whale.</b> The minke <b>whale</b> was first {{described}} by the Danish naturalist Otto Fabricius in 1780, who assumed it must be an already known species and assigned his specimen to Balaena rostrata, a name given to the northern bottlenose <b>whale</b> by Otto Friedrich Müller in 1776. In 1804, Bernard Germain de Lacépède described a juvenile specimen of Balaenoptera acuto-rostrata. The name is a partial translation of Norwegian minkehval, possibly after a Norwegian whaler named Meincke, who mistook a northern minke <b>whale</b> for a blue <b>whale.</b>|$|R
