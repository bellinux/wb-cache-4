Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting: [...] "When he [...] and Geri started making eyes at each other I knew what was going on, even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me." [...] Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side of things. They were very close. They clicked. And I think the lyrics in [...] "2 Become 1" [...] came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{acting in}} State of Play and The Deal won him {{considerable}} acclaim; {{he was nominated}} for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor {{for his role as}} Collins but lost to his co-star Bill Nighy. His performance in The Deal was acclaimed by Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's former spin doctor, and Tim Allan, a deputy press secretary of Tony Blair. A BBC News Online writer praised Morrissey's grasp of Brown's physical tics in a review that criticised the rest of the film. Morrissey's performance won the RTS Programme Award for Best Male Actor the next year, this time beating Nighy. The RTS jury wrote of Morrissey, [...] "The strength of this performance brought to the screen, and to life, all of the characteristics and traits of the man he portrayed {{in a way that was}} both credible and convincing." [...] In 2009, Morrissey declined the opportunity to play Brown again in The Special Relationship, Morgan's third Blair film, as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mindset of playing Brown for just one scene.|$|E

They don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it {{to make sure that the}} alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E

60|$|The train which carried Alethia {{towards her}} {{destination}} {{was a local}} one, with the wayside station habit strongly developed. At most of the stations {{no one seemed to}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> train or to leave it, but at one there were several market folk on the platform, and two men, of the farmer or small cattle-dealer class, entered Alethia’s carriage. Apparently they had just foregathered, after a day’s business, and their conversation consisted of a rapid exchange of short friendly inquiries as to health, family, stock, and so forth, and some grumbling remarks on the weather. Suddenly, however, their talk took a dramatically interesting turn, and Alethia listened with wide-eyed attention.|$|E
