5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> are in therapy, and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> are currently on medication.|$|E

His wish is granted when he helps Edward return to his world through the opened Gate on a rocket before he is fatally shot by Rudolf Hess of the Thule Society.|$|E
5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
50|$|In film, the {{aesthetic}} distance is often violated unintentionally. Examples might include a director's cameo, poor special effects, or perhaps blatant product placement - any can {{be enough to}} pull a viewer out {{of the reality of}} the film. David Mamet in On Directing Film asserts that any direct depiction of graphic sex or violence in film is an inherent violation of aesthetic distance, as audience members will instinctively make judgments as to <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> what <b>they</b> just saw was real, and thus be pulled out of the story-telling.|$|R

5|$|Features {{necessary}} for defending a territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, {{have been found in}} their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> are as ancient as those found in Cornelia. Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and {{it has been suggested that}} these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according to <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> had had time to prepare.

As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall.

Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a swarm of space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a member of their species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> are ready to have children.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> are lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention}} of the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{disagreement}} among Discordians as to <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> through OM, <b>they</b> {{should seek to}} improve society, topple it, or claim that the practice is in fact only for entertainment.

50|$|Dutch Americans are Americans of Dutch descent whose {{ancestors}} {{came from}} the Netherlands in the recent <b>or</b> distant past. <b>Whether</b> intentional <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>they</b> usually maintain connections with their Dutch heritage, by having, for example, a Dutch surname or belonging to a Dutch community group. Dutch settlement in the Americas started in 1613 with New Amsterdam, which was exchanged with the British for the current Suriname at the treaty of Breda (1667) and renamed New York City. The British split the Dutch colony of New Netherlands into two pieces, and named them New York and New Jersey. Further waves of immigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|R
