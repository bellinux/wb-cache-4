A drunken Drax summons Ronan {{while the rest of}} the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector Taneleer Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> it.

As a result, Iori sometimes helps him {{in order to have}} the opportunity to have a final fight against him. Aside from the main series, Iori appears in several other media series such as spin-offs and crossover video games, and comic adaptations of the series.|$|E

5000|$|Dragon Age II is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game. The player starts {{the game by}} creating a character whose family name is [...] "Hawke". The player decides the given name, gender, appearance and combat specialty (role) of Hawke. Hawke can be either a warrior (<b>who</b> <b>wields</b> sword, axe, mace and shield), a rogue (<b>who</b> <b>wields</b> dagger or bow and arrow) or a mage (<b>who</b> <b>wields</b> a magical staff and uses magic).|$|R

5|$|Units {{each have}} a {{character}} class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, and how much effect they have on other units, whether they used passive or aggressive skills. There are thirty classes available to choose from: these include mounted units such as the Pegasus Knight, Sorcerers and Healers that wield magic for attack and healing respectively, soldiers <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> swords and axes, and archers who specialize in long distance attacks. The only class that is character exclusive is the Lord class, which is used by Marth. Limitations are placed on how many of one class {{can be used in}} a single battle. When a unit has reached Level 10, their class can be evolved along a select number of routes using an item called a Master Seal. Units can also be re-classed, changing to a completely different class or back to their original class at the player's discretion: the re-class options has limits as there are only a limited number of available classes for a unit to change into. If a class change is reversed, all the unit's previous stats will be retained. Each unit's weapon, which is directly associated with its class, has its level raised based on the amount of usage, while also decreasing its durability — unless merged with another identical item, the weapon will break after its maximum number of uses.|$|E
25|$|Although Calvinists believe God and {{the truth}} of God cannot be plural, they also believe that those civil {{ordinances}} of man which restrain man from evil and encourage toward good, are ordinances of God (regardless of the religion, or lack of it, of those <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> that power). Christians are obligated to be at peace with all men, {{as far as it}} is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's sake, and to pray for enemies.|$|E

Three characters are playable: Jack Foster, an adult male construction worker <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> a sledgehammer, Mike Bacon, a brave obese boy scout carrying explosives, and Foxy Jones, a tough African American traffic warden with a handgun. The rise of rock n roll has caused the dead to rise from their graves and return to life as the undead.|$|E

He is being obstructed on this quest by a strange landscape of odd rooms and a threatening train; while being stalked by the [...] "Donut Men", <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> electricity as a weapon. In addition to the detective's story, the film was to show the tale of Ronald d'Arte, a teenage dwarf, who suffers a surgical mishap which leaves him dependent on being plugged into an electrical supply at regular intervals; this dependence grants him an affinity over electricity which he can use to produce music or cause destruction. The boy names himself Ronnie Rocket and becomes a rock star, befriending a tap-dancer named Electra-Cute.|$|E
500|$|The Mana Tree and the Mana Sword, called Excalibur in Final Fantasy Adventures English version, are {{recurring}} plot devices {{which have}} been featured in every game of the series. The mystical Mana Tree {{is a source of}} magic which sustains the balance and nature of the series' world. The Mana Sword is typically used to restore this balance when it becomes lost in the games. Final Fantasy Adventure explains that if the Mana Tree dies, a member of the Mana Family will become the [...] "seed" [...] of a new Tree. A sprout of the Mana Tree is called a Gemma, while protectors of the Tree, <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> the Mana Sword, are called Gemma Knights. In Seiken Densetsu 3, a Goddess is said to have turned into the Mana Tree after creating the world with the Mana Sword. The Mana Tree is destroyed near the game ending in Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana, but a character becomes the new Mana Tree in the former game.|$|E
500|$|In {{political}} sociology, one of Weber's {{most influential}} contributions is his [...] "Politics as a Vocation" [...] (Politik als Beruf) essay. Therein, Weber unveils {{the definition of}} the state as that entity that possesses a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> this power. A politician must not be a man of the [...] "true Christian ethic", understood by Weber as being the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount, that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek. An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a saint, for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it. The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of attitude and the ethic of responsibility (" [...] vs [...] ") and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).|$|E

500|$|Wu was {{in general}} loyal to Deng Xiaoping's government, but {{continued}} to be an outspoken critic. In 1983, he dismissed Deng's Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign as futile. In September 1986, he read an essay {{at a meeting of}} the China Writers Association entitled [...] "Against Those <b>Who</b> <b>Wield</b> the Scissors—a Plea for an End to Censorship". It was enthusiastically received by the audience, but only a censored version was published, minus 1,000 characters deemed [...] "acrimonious". After the December 1986 student demonstrations, he was pressured to leave the Communist Party in 1987. Retired Politburo member Hu Qiaomu came to his home in person to demand his resignation from the Party. He obliged, as he did not think he was [...] "the sort of person who should be in the Party." [...] In spring 1989, Wu signed a petition calling for greater political freedom. Following the army crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Wu called for a reassessment of the incident, but was forbidden to speak at a CPPCC meeting.|$|E
500|$|Common law constitutionalism, a {{view that}} there are {{fundamental}} constitutional values that are protected even from interference by Parliament, had become increasingly popular {{at the time of}} Jackson. Four recent cases had found that [...] "in the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts [...] presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual". There had also been extrajudicial comments by serving judges that parliamentary sovereignty may not be absolute: Lord Woolf had written that [...] "if Parliament did the unthinkable, then I would say that courts would also be required to act in a manner which was without precedent" [...] while John Laws had argued that [...] "ultimate sovereignty rests ... not with those <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> governmental power, but in the conditions under which they are permitted to do so. The constitution, not the Parliament, is in this sense sovereign". However, Jackson contained the first express support from judges acting in their official capacity for the proposition that courts might have the authority to strike down an Act of Parliament if it violated fundamental constitutional principles (albeit obiter). This was a significant challenge to the orthodox view of parliamentary sovereignty, expressed by Albert Venn Dicey, that Parliament can make and unmake law on any topic and that no body can make a higher form of law than Parliament or set aside primary legislation.|$|E
2500|$|From its ideological framework, the Communist Party understands imperialism as the {{pinnacle}} of capitalist development: the state, working {{on behalf of the}} few <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> disproportionate power, assumes the role of proffering [...] "phony rationalizations" [...] for economically driven imperial ambition as a means to promote the sectional economic interests of big business.|$|E

2500|$|A {{common theme}} {{in his writing}} {{has been that the}} strongest of us can {{gradually}} be broken and tamed by those <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> the whip of power. Those who rule, Zakaria Tamer tells us in many a story, while devoid of all the noble qualities that should be theirs, possess the intuitive awareness of how to use the carrot and the stick. Muhammad al-Maghut, a well known Arab critic, once contrasted him with Charles Darwin: one showing how humans developed from monkeys, the other showing how humans could be manipulated into becoming monkeys.|$|E

One of her best known speeches is the [...] "Freedom From Fear" [...] speech, which begins, [...] "It is not power that corrupts but fear.

Saïx joins the Organization around the same time as Axel but, lacking the care-free personality and morals his original self had, uses Axel to become Xemnas' second in command, and feels betrayed when Axel comes befriends with Roxas, putting his plan to get leverage over Xemnas on hold. Saïx appears completely void of emotion and completely embraces his status as a Nobody, yet continually reflects on previously having a heart.

The research team visited São Paulo several times and went to lengths researching the local gangs, police and special forces, including each group's choice of equipment and firearms.

2500|$|In 1924 Webern {{arranged}} Franz Liszt's Arbeiterchor (Workers' Chorus, c. 1847–48) {{for bass}} solo, mixed chorus, and large orchestra; it was premièred {{for the first}} time in any form on March 13 and 14, 1925, with Webern conducting the first full-length concert of the Austrian Association of Workers Choir. A review in the Amtliche Wiener Zeitung (March 28, 1925) read [...] "neu in jedem Sinne, frisch, unverbraucht, durch ihn zieht die Jugend, die Freude" [...] ("new in every respect, fresh, vital, pervaded by youth and joy"). The text, in English translation, reads in part: [...] "Let us have the adorned spades and scoops,/ Come along all, <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> a sword or pen,/ Come here ye, industrious, brave and strong/ All who create things great or small." [...] Liszt, initially inspired by his revolutionary countrymen, had left it in manuscript at publisher Carl Haslinger's discretion.|$|E
2500|$|A Keyblade {{changes in}} both {{appearance}} and strength with different keychains, which augment its wielder's fighting capabilities; some are obtained {{as a result}} of in-game events, while others can be obtained by completing mini-games. A driving element to the first game is the ability to seal the [...] "heart" [...] of a world by locking the keyhole to the door leading to it, preventing it from being destroyed by Heartless. In Kingdom Hearts II, the player uses the Keyblade to unlock pathways between worlds that were closed after the events of the first game. While Sora {{is the only one who}} uses the Keyblade in the first game, later games reveal more characters <b>who</b> <b>wield</b> Keyblades. In Birth by Sleep, Keyblades can be transformed into hovercrafts called Keyblade Gliders, which can be used to travel from world to world, making Keyblade wielders the only people with the means of transportation between worlds before Gummi Ships are used.
