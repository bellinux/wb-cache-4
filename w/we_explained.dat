500|$|<b>We</b> <b>explained</b> to {{him what}} the song was about and he said, [...] "So, {{breaking}} out ... what about a boarding school?" [...] We love any movies to do with boarding schools – Cruel Intentions, The Craft. We were like [...] "Yes, yes!" [...] and we all brainstormed from there [...] We really had to push. A lot [...] We {{had a lot of}} control over making the music on this record and we wrote [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] so we would have the best idea of what the video would be. So it was [...] "Use our ideas. They're free" [...] Because the song is so different from the first record, we wanted to make a video that was young and fun that kids could relate to. The video idea that was first proposed really was not for a young market. It was a lot older.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes. <b>We</b> <b>explained</b> {{our system}} of tickets, and the Arch-deacon {{said it was a}} very good one, and ought to be adopted everywhere." ...|$|E
60|$|Bulls, <b>we</b> <b>explained,</b> {{were not}} a {{department}} of research for which we were equipped. What we wanted, we said, was to learn something of his methods of work.|$|E
30|$|In the following, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{specially}} designed transceive beamforming for MGMW relaying. First, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the generalised linear transceive beamforming based on three different optimisation criteria, namely, MF, ZF, and MMSE. Afterwards, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the generalised BC-strategy-aware (BCSA) transceive beamforming.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> mainly <b>explain</b> the {{proposed}} algorithm for polynomial SVD, yet wherever it seems necessary <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the result for both decomposition.|$|R
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{the main}} theorem.|$|R
60|$|We {{endeavored}} {{unsuccessfully to}} induce her {{to believe that}} we were sober, and <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> that our course of conduct was what was always pursued on the stage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you suppose}} Ugu {{would listen to}} reason?" [...] asked Betsy. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> to him how wicked he has been, don't you think he'd let poor Ozma go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{showed his}} whole row of teeth in a smile. [...] "Oh, the {{assembly}} calls itself Socialist now," [...] he said, [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> {{to them that}} this was a question for men of science." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the next}} subsection, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> our {{proposed}} algorithm.|$|R
30|$|First, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> why <b>we</b> {{chose the}} above conditions.|$|R
30|$|We {{discuss these}} {{patterns}} in three points. First, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{in what sense}} the fit is actually surprisingly good. Second, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the selection mechanism in our model {{that leads to the}} simulated wage pattern. Third, we discuss how introducing fixed effects could provide a better fit—but at a cost.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> to the man, {{the garden}} or the coal cellar {{would have been}} the proper place for the operation; no one but an idiot would have {{attempted}} to perform it in a kitchen, and without help.|$|E
60|$|The Captain led {{off with}} a miss in baulk. Malooney gripped his cue, drew in a deep breath, and let fly. The result was ten: a cannon and all three balls in the same pocket. As {{a matter of fact}} he made the cannon twice; but the second time, as <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> to him, of course did not count.|$|E
60|$|Early as it was, {{he was up}} and about, for the Wigtown peasants are {{an early}} rising race. <b>We</b> <b>explained</b> our mission to him in as few words as possible, and having made his bargain--what Scot ever {{neglected}} that preliminary?--he agreed not only to let us have {{the use of his}} dog but to come with us himself.|$|E
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the {{applicability}} of Theorem 4.5 through an example.|$|R
30|$|In this section, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the three-tier and fat-tree DCN {{architectures}} {{indicating the}} merits of fat-tree topology. We discuss traffic characteristics of data center networks and indicate the different traffic patterns commonly found in diverse data center applications. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> the incast and outcast congestion in data center networks and discuss basic features of DCTCP.|$|R
30|$|In this section, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{the basic}} {{work of the}} {{proposed}} protocol.|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Man Billfinger, {{being charged}} {{with a kind of}} rhetoric, makes speeches every time we stop. <b>We</b> <b>explained</b> to such {{citizens}} as we happened to step on that we were celebrating the dawn of our own private brand of liberty, and to please enter such inhumanities as we might commit on the list of unavoidable casualties.|$|E
6000|$|... [361] ["Isaac Martin, one of {{the guard}} over me, I saw, had an {{inclination}} to assist me; and as he fed me with shaddock (my lips being quite parched with my endeavours {{to bring about a}} change), <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> our wishes to each other by our looks; but this being observed, Martin was instantly removed from me."--A Narrative, etc., 1790, p. 4.] ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>explained</b> to Number Fourteen {{the gravity}} of the case, and also the {{tentative}} character of the operation under lethodyne. At first, she shrank from taking it. [...] "No, no!" [...] she said; [...] "let me die quietly." [...] But Hilda, like the Angel of Mercy that she was, whispered in the girl's ear: [...] "IF it succeeds, you will get quite well, and--you can marry Arthur." ...|$|E
30|$|In this section, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the {{relationship}} between inequalities (1.1)–(1.5) and (2.1).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} partial-order, conformant, {{probabilistic}} planner, Probapop which {{competed in the}} blind track of the Probabilistic Planning Competition in IPC- 4. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> how <b>we</b> adapt distance based heuristics for use with probabilistic domains. Probapop also incorporates heuristics based on probability of success. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> the successes and difficulties encountered during the design and implementation of Probapop. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this {{document}} <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{the concept and}} the structure of the tutorial v 1. This version of the tutorial addresses experts in the PRIME consortium and experts outside PRIME with a comparable knowledge. The main deliverable is the tutorial itself. In chapter 2 <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> how to access the tutorial which is realized on the eLearning system BluES...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the minds}} of those Swedish, Irish, English, Polish, German, or Bohemian dairymaids," [...] we murmured, dreamily, and when our reader roused us from our muse with a sharp [...] "What?" [...] <b>we</b> <b>explained,</b> [...] "Of course they were not American dairymaids, for {{it stands to reason that}} if they were dairymaids they could not be Americans, or if Americans they could not be dairymaids." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are rich}} English from London," [...] said I; {{for that was}} how <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> {{everything}} that was above our comprehension in the border counties. We stood for {{the best part of}} an hour watching the bonny craft, and then, as the sun was lying low on a cloudbank and there was a nip in the evening air, we turned back to West Inch.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> {{that it was}} the {{character}} of monarchs that had changed, and that the one under whom we lived was venerated and beloved by all right-thinking people in her vast realms. Also, we told her that real power in our country rested {{in the hands of the}} people, and that we were in fact ruled by the votes of the lower and least educated classes of the community.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the two Wai-Menyuk models of birefringence in periodically spun fibers, and {{we show that}} the differential group delay differs significantly for the two models when the spin period approaches or exceeds the fiber beat length. When the fiber correlation length is large, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> this difference quantitatively, and <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> it qualitatively for any fiber correlation length...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a written}} {{version of a}} series of lectures aimed at {{graduate}} students in particle theory/string theory/particle experiment familiar with the basics of the Standard Model. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> the many reasons for the interest in flavour physics. We describe flavour physics and the related CP violation within the Standard Model, and explain how the B-factories proved that the Kobayashi- Maskawa mechanism dominates the CP violation that is observed in meson decays. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> the implications of flavour physics for new physics. We emphasize the “new physics flavour puzzle”. As an explicit example, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> how the recent measurements ofD 0 −D 0 mixing constrain the supersymmetric flavour structure. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> how the ATLAS and CMS experiments can solve the new physics flavour puzzle and perhaps shed light on the standard model flavour puzzle. Finally, we describe various interpretations of the neutrino flavour data and their impact on flavour models...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> linear {{secret sharing}} schemes, in {{particular}} multiplicative threshold linear secret sharing schemes, over fields and rings in a compact and concise way. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> two characterisations of linear secret sharing schemes, and in particular, we characterise threshold linear secret sharing schemes. We develop an algorithm to generate all multiplicative $(t+ 1) $-out-of-$n$ threshold linear secret sharing schemes over a field $mathbb{Z}sb{p}$. For the ring $mathbb{Z}sb{ 2 sp{ 32 }}$, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{the generation of}} secret sharing schemes for threshold access structures and prove the non-existence of $(t+ 1) $-out-of-$n$ threshold linear secret sharing schemes with $n > t+ 1 $. </p...|$|R
60|$|We {{appealed to}} the chambermaid. <b>We</b> <b>explained</b> to her {{that we wanted to}} wash--to clean ourselves--not to blow bubbles. Could we not have bigger basins and more water and more {{extensive}} towels? The chambermaid (a staid old lady of about fifty) did not think that anything better could be done for us by the hotel fraternity of Cologne, and seemed to think that the river was more what we wanted.|$|E
60|$|We {{caught him}} one morning {{about two miles}} out from Mountain Valley, {{on his way to}} look after some of his burnt umber farm land. He was an elegant old gentleman, as thin and tall as a trout rod, with frazzled shirt-cuffs and specs on a black string. <b>We</b> <b>explained</b> to him, brief and easy, what we wanted; and Caligula showed him, careless, the handle of his forty-five under his coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Positively, my dear, I don't know. But <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> {{to him at}} {{once that}} it was only an {{accident}} and that the person hadn't known and that of course it wouldn't occur again. After that he was softened a little, but he went off muttering to himself, and that evening he dug up all the new tulips and threw them over the fence. We saw him do it, but we didn't dare say anything." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{this section}} <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{a very simple}} example to show the {{reduction}} process.|$|R
50|$|CMI {{entanglement}} has {{its roots}} in classical (non-quantum) information theory, as <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> next.|$|R
30|$|At first, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the {{empirical}} design before we show {{the results and}} their robustness.|$|R
