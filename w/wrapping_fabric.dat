50|$|CFRP {{can also}} be applied to enhance shear {{strength}} of reinforced concrete by <b>wrapping</b> <b>fabrics</b> or fibers around the section to be strengthened. Wrapping around sections (such as bridge or building columns) can also enhance the ductility of the section, greatly increasing the resistance to collapse under earthquake loading. Such 'seismic retrofit' is the major application in earthquake-prone areas, since {{it is much more}} economic than alternative methods.|$|R

40|$|Carbon FRP has {{recently}} {{being used as}} strengthening elements of reinforced concrete elements such as beams. Two sets of experiments was carried out to study the behaviour beams strengthened with FRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> and beams strengthened with FRP plates. The first set consists of 3 beams; a control beam, a beam reinforced with FRP plates, and a pre-cracked beam reinforced with FRP plates. Observations were made on the ultimate load capacity, load-deflection behaviour, crack pattern and propagation of tested beams. Ultimate load capacity of strengthened beams {{increased by more than}} 20 % when compared to control beam. Strengthened beams also exhibited improved load-deflection behaviour and crack pattern and propagation behaviour. The behaviour of the pre-cracked beam was almost the same as the uncracked beam. The second set of 3 beams was designed with no shear reinforcement so that the beams would fail in shear. Two of the beams were <b>wrapped</b> with FRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> while one acts as control. One of the wrapped beams was wrapped with one layer 90 o to the horizontal while the other was wrapped with two layers; one at 45 o and the other at â€“ 45 o to the horizontal. Load carrying capacity and load-deflection behaviour of all beams tested were observed. From the results of the experiments {{it can be seen that}} the load carrying capacity of the strengthened beams wrapped at 90 o to the horizontal almost doubled when compared while the other wrapped beam more than double its load carrying capacity. From the experiments, it is shown that both FRP plates and <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> strengthened beams that were misdesigned or damaged which should encourage their use it the repair of structural elements amongst practitioners...|$|R

40|$|When Somalia {{became an}} {{independent}} nation in 1960, {{the change in}} power was celebrated with new postage stamps. Departing from the royal portraits and vague images of 2 ̆ 2 natives 2 ̆ 2 favored by their colonizers, Somalis chose to circulate detailed images of local plants, animals, artisanal products, and beautiful young women in <b>wrapped</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In the early 1960 s, these images were fairly accurate representations of contemporary fashions. Over the next twenty years, with a few notable exceptions, these images became more romanticized focusing on the folk dress worn by nomads {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century. Confronting drought, corruption, and economic interference from the West, dictator Siad Barre (who came to power in a military coup in 1969) longed openly for the 2 ̆ 2 good old days 2 ̆ 2 of nomadic life. As the country became increasingly unstable in the 1980 s, leading to the collapse of the national government in 1991, postal depictions of textiles and wrapped clothing became even more divorced from reality: surface patterns unrelated to the drape of the cloth, fabrics that were too thin or wrapped in impossible ways, and styles of dress that were nothing but fantasy. This paper is based on an analysis of postage stamps collected by the author dating from the 1920 s to 2000. As a form of material culture closely tied to national governments, postage stamps provide a fascinating window into the changing political landscape of Somalia...|$|R
