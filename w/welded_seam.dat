40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above. Inadequate fulfilment of these conditions, verified by the FEsimulations, is the cause of inferior <b>weld</b> <b>seams,</b> associated with low values of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator.

40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength. These correlations exist only when top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having non uniform <b>seam</b> boundary. However, <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having uniform seam boundary do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength.

5000|$|PVF film {{lamination}} {{is made up}} of {{polyvinyl fluoride}} (commercially known as Tedlar). It consists of a film layer laminated to the PVC fabric during the manufacturing process. The result is a thicker fabric that can resist weather and chemical agents better than competing fabrics. Its self-cleaning ability repels such things as acid rain, graffiti, and bird droppings. Because of these characteristics it can often be found in use in industrialized areas, desert regions, and coastal zones. The thicker coating has a slow erosion rate, resulting in a life expectancy of approximately 25 years depending upon environmental conditions. This topcoating is flexible, which creates a strong and consistent bond to the PVC. PVF coated fabrics may be manufactured in a variety of colors, but are also subject to minimum manufacture runs. PVF coating also makes the fabric non-weldable.

The definition had previously created an unwanted amount of work for the end user and slowed down the usability of the software. By improving the functionality of the software it was possible to partly improve the process for quality assurance and to minimize human error created in the defining of <b>welding</b> <b>seams.</b> In this thesis the goal was to create an automatic segmentation tool for <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{and at the same time}} lower the amount of manual adjustment required to run the software. Through the implementation of the new functionality we were able to research the sufficiency of the transformation method used on the <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> while considering the requirements of quality assurance. The new functionality was tested by using documented measurement data to avoid the need to use any physical measurement system. Results include examples obtained using the created tool. The used transformation for <b>welding</b> <b>seams</b> was insufficient considering the quality of point data that is available for the current software. To automatically define <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> in the software the quality of data has to be improved or the transformation needs to be performed locally...|$|R

This passage {{develops}} {{a set of}} arithmetic process for {{the image of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> in flanges, which suits the weld process according to the feature of the seam. In terms of the arithmetic process for image, traditional methods are replaced by the opening and closing of mathematical morphology, which effectively smoothes the interferences of weld points, surface scratches, glistens and false edges, thus forming sharp and smooth image of <b>weld</b> <b>seam.</b> The arithmetic process of image proves to be brief and highly effective, which meets the practical need of the construction supported by the image of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam.</b> This passage also, taking <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> as an example, focuses on the discussion of the erosion and dilation of the opening and closing calculations, which are of great value towards administering the process of processing editing the image...|$|R
