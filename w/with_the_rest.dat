40|$|Convulsions were induced in 80 % of CBA mice by {{throwing}} stimulation six from eight weeks after birth, and continued {{for more than}} one year. The procedure for causing a CBA mouse convulsion was as follows: the mouse was rolled over suddenly {{by throwing}} stimulation and set in tonic flexion. After a few seconds of clonic convulsion, tonic extension followed, and opisthotonus was observed in this stage. After a convulsion, the mouse rose, seemed stunned for a few seconds, then recovered to a normal state. This convulsive process took about 10 - 15 seconds for the whole procedure. Urinary incontinence was observed. Bilateral sporadic spikes of about 100 - 150 μV were induced in <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> stage of stimulated CBA mice, but the EEG was not abnormal in normal untreated mice. Dopamine (DA) in the cortex and brainstem of the CBA mouse at the pre-convulsive stage was significantly decreased compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> stage, and these changes recovered during the convulsion stage. DA in the cerebellum was also significantly decreased one hour after convulsion. Norepinephrine (NE) of CBA cortex was significantly decreased before, during, and one hour after, a convulsion, compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> stage. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in the CBA brainstem was significantly decreased compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> stage, and this change recovered to the normal level one hour after a convulsion. DA and 5 HT of the cortex of CBA mice, which convulsions had induced {{for more than one}} year, were significantly decreased compared with untreated CBA mice of the same age.
