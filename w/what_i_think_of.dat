I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before rehearsals {{began in}} January 1951, Rodgers {{had the first}} Tuptim, Doretta Morrow, sing the entire score to Lawrence, {{including}} Lawrence's own songs. [...] Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer's actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies. [...] Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. [...] James Poling, a writer for Collier's who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing [...] "Shall I Tell You <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> You?": ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the divided {{contemporary}} response, Middlemarch gained immediate admirers; in 1873, the poet Emily Dickinson expressed high praise for the novel, exclaiming {{in a letter to}} a friend: [...] "What do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Middlemarch? <b>What</b> do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> glory." ...|$|R
500|$|In her room, Anna replays the {{confrontation}} in her mind, her anger building ("Shall I Tell You <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> You?"). [...] Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged {{to take over}} Siam as a protectorate. [...] Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. [...] Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support ("Something Wonderful"). [...] Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. [...] The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. [...] Anna [...] "guesses" [...] – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion. [...] Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, Uncle Tom's Cabin, that can {{be presented to the}} guests. [...] News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare. [...] The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house [...] "as provided in agreement, etc., etc." ...|$|E

When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: [...] "The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall {{have to wait and see}} what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1908, as the Olympic trials approached, sports {{reporter}} H.V. Valentine wrote, [...] "No {{figure in}} the world of athletics is attracting more attention these days than that of John G. [...] Garrles, the great all around athlete of the University of Michigan." [...] Another reporter noted, [...] "Garrels is undoubtedly the best all around man the middle west has ever produced. [...] He can hurdle, jump and toss the weights and is sure to gather points for America in the many events in which he can make a strong showing." [...] The Pittsburg Press called Garrels [...] "one of the greatest athletes ever developed in the history of manly sports in America." [...] Even Martin Sheridan (a five-time Olympic gold medalist) opined, [...] "He's the greatest all-around athlete in our country -- that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him. [...] Some day I hope to meet him, and, win or lose, that will be the greatest day of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Davout marched from Naumburg {{to glory}} at Auerstedt, Bernadotte refused {{to join his}} fellow marshal despite {{positive}} orders to do so. Instead, he executed an earlier set of orders to march to Dornburg and missed the fighting at both Jena and Auerstedt. Bernadotte found himself in serious trouble with his emperor. In a conversation with General of Division Jean Rapp Napoleon guessed that Bernadotte's behavior was caused by professional jealousy. The emperor remarked to General of Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary, [...] "This business is so hateful that if I send him before a court-martial {{it will be the}} equivalent of ordering him to be shot; it is better for me not to speak to him about it, but I shall take care he shall know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> his behavior. I believe he has enough honor to recognize that he has performed a disgraceful action regarding which I shall not bandy words with him." [...] In the end, Bernadotte's career may have been saved because of Napoleon's fondness for his wife Désirée Clary, whom he almost married.|$|E
2500|$|In 1882 Brahms {{completed}} his Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 83, dedicated to his teacher Marxsen. Brahms was invited by Hans von Bülow {{to undertake a}} premiere of the work with the Meiningen Court Orchestra; this {{was the beginning of}} his collaboration with Meiningen and with von Bülow, who was to rank Brahms as one of the 'Three Bs'; {{in a letter to his}} wife he wrote [...] "You know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Brahms: after Bach and Beethoven the greatest, the most sublime of all composers." [...] The following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony Op. 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony Op. 98 (1885). Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms's music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: [...] "a giant work, great in concept and invention." [...] Another, but cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance; he rated Brahms as superior to Anton Bruckner, but more earth-bound than Wagner and Beethoven.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bicycle on female {{emancipation}} should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation {{in the lives of}} Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, [...] "Let me tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as [...] "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named [...] "Gladys", for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, [...] "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." [...] Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.|$|E
