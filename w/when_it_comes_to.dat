5|$|Today, the eliminativist view is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered to be an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to summarize the difference between the Churchlands's views and Dennett's view is that the Churchlands are eliminativists <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> propositional attitudes, but reductionists concerning qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist with respect to propositional attitudes, and an eliminativist concerning qualia.|$|E

The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> the internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E
5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} major themes of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> the license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E

In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something theNew Scientisthas coinednominative determinism. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> names influencing choice of occupation.

5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> money bills.|$|E
