5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> low.|$|E
5|$|Benedict of Peterborough quotes in his Miracula S. Thome Cantuariensis {{a letter}} to him from Robert, giving an account of his healing from a serious illness, for which he credits the intercession of Thomas Becket.

The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. Dalmatia, {{the southern part of the}} border, <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars.|$|E

5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E

These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|Besides his episcopal appointments, Hugh {{was rewarded}} with two manors in Somerset, {{including}} the Treasurer's House in Martock which he made his primary residence, {{and the right to}} collect taxes and fines in two hundreds in Somerset. He also served as the royal custodian of the diocese of Lincoln while the see was vacant between 1200 and 1203, collecting the revenues of the see, most of which went to the king while a see was without a bishop.

5|$|Davis {{has been}} faulted for poor {{coordination}} {{and management of}} his generals. This includes his reluctance to resolve a dispute between Leonidas Polk, a personal friend, and Braxton Bragg, who was defeated in important battles and distrusted by his subordinates. He <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious Joseph E. Johnston until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col. James Phelan of Mississippi, he replaced him with John Bell Hood.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Gagak Item the Wongs, Saeroen, Roekiah, and Mochtar {{continued}} to work with Tan's Film.

Saeroen, Joshua Wong, and Mochtar left the company in 1940: Wong and Mochtar after payment disputes, and Saeroen to return to journalism. Through 1941 Tan's Film produced fewer movies than its competitors, and was ultimately shut down following the Japanese occupation in early 1942.|$|E
