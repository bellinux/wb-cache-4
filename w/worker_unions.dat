The call for the founding conference had been done by the Christian <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Göteborg (Göteborgs kristliga arbetareförbund). Attendees included the Malmö and Limhamn branches of the an older Christian <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> (Kristna arbetareförbundet), branches of the Swedish <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> and other Christian labour associations.

25|$|FLOC {{continued}} {{to address issues}} related to its collective bargaining agreement in the late 1980s. Midwestern tomato farmers began complaining that the Campbell's Soup pact was not adequate. Campbell's purchased {{only a portion of}} their product, but the higher costs of wages and benefits affected their entire crop. Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete with cheap Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican farm <b>worker</b> <b>unions,</b> then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages. The strategy was successful: The higher Mexican wages and benefits closed the price differential, and Midwestern growers no longer threatened to break their pact with FLOC.|$|E

Wallin and Stone gave recording industry talks at the Paramount's Scoring Studio M in September 1982, describing how the recording business should expand into motion pictures to counteract flagging profit margins. Stone said that, {{in order to be}} recognized by the film <b>worker</b> <b>unions,</b> he formed a separate business entity called Record Plant Scoring, and hired a separate crew of union engineers.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{unions and}} {{collective}} bargaining were outlawed from {{no later than}} {{the middle of the}} 14th century when the Ordinance of Labourers was enacted in the Kingdom of England. As collective bargaining and early <b>worker</b> <b>unions</b> grew with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest {{at the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars. In 1799, the Combination Act was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as Luddism and had been prominent in struggles such as the 1820 Rising in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a general strike, which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the Combination Act 1825 severely restricted their activity.|$|E

25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) had {{attempted}} to organize auto workers since the early 1920s with little success. After {{the passage of the}} National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933, the AFL again spearheaded a major drive in automobile manufacturing, this time organizing workers into federal labor unions. By March, more than 32,000 workers (representing about 17 percent of the total automotive manufacturing workforce) had been organized. On March 4, 1934, auto workers at Buick, Fisher Body, and Hudson voted to strike unless the employers recognized their unions, rehired all workers fired for union activity, and raised wages 20 percent. The AFL had accepted severe restrictions on union organizing in the auto industry code (accepted by the government in early fall 1933), did not do much organizing under the code, utilized craft rather than industrial organizers whose main role appeared to be to suppress worker militancy rather than organize unions, and acquiesced when Hugh S. Johnson reinterpreted Section 7(a) in February 1934 to require proportional rather than exclusive representation. Worried that the auto <b>worker</b> <b>unions</b> might actually strike, the AFL negotiated with the government {{to find a way to}} avoid a strike.|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, both {{entities}} {{participated in}} a march against the measures of the Fortuño administration along groups that fell outside the independence movement, which interrupted the traffic in several routes and converged at Plaza Las Americas (a mall owned by the Fonalledas family, prominent members of the Puerto Rico Republican Party, to which Fortuño is affiliated). The following week the 2009 Cataño oil refinery fire began. The Macheteros felt that expressions made by government functionaries labeling protestors as [...] "terrorists" [...] and the subsequent investigation of the fire as potentially intentional were intended to link separate events and degrade the public perception of the protests. Believing {{that the federal government}} could be executing a plan to [...] "escalate the persecution against students (in reference to animosity between the UPR and the government which eventually led to a strike), <b>worker</b> <b>unions</b> and independentists [...] ", the EPB warned of four possible ways in which such an approach could benefit the government; by misdirecting the attention away from the administration, by trying to create a contrast that would portray Fortuño positively, by intimidating potential protestors and by persecuting them. To justify their statement, the organization cited that immediately after the fire began, Fraticelli, Figueroa Sancha, Rodríguez Ema and Santini held a reunion where they established that [...] "it was a good moment to behead the dissident movements".|$|E

50|$|The {{union was}} founded in {{response}} to an anti-communist purge in the Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Sweden following its March 1921 congress in Norrköping. Around the country, district conferences of the Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Sweden were held in which communists were removed from leadership positions in the union. The communists issued a call for the foundation of a new nationwide agricultural labourers' union. The invitation to the founding congress of the Forest and Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Sweden was sent to all sections of the Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Sweden. The appeal cited the rejection of the declarations of the Norrköping congress by many of its attending delegates (including the leadership of the Forest and Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Central Sweden). However, the Forest and Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Central Sweden had split shortly after the Norrköping congress. The majority of the organization (the sections in Västmanland) had rejoined the Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Sweden. The rump Forest and Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> of Central Sweden (consisting of the Dalarna district organization and a few other section) would serve as the basis of the new nationwide union.|$|R

2500|$|Given its {{industrial}} basis, Scranton {{has had a}} notable labor history; various coal <b>worker</b> <b>unions</b> struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers. [...] The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the Great Railroad Strike, attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the Scranton General Strike. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. William Walker Scranton, from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded Scranton Steel Company.|$|E
2500|$|The Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 (c 26) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The Act {{was introduced to the}} House of Commons by Kevan Jones, MP for North Durham as a Private Member's Bill on 7 January 2004.

Although it was traditional for major retailers to close on 25 December, some retailers, such as Woolworths, began to open some stores in the late 1990s. Both religious groups and shop <b>worker</b> <b>unions</b> were against the idea of Christmas openings, leading to pressure on the Government to pass legislation to prevent the practice. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament debated a similar law that would apply to shops in Scotland.
