5|$|Ryan White {{was born}} at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, the {{bleeding}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop.</b> When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe hemophilia A, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of Factor VIII, a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in the Moroccan Quarter of the Old City. They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them {{to be taken care}} of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May, an {{immediate}} vigil and protest {{was launched in}} light of international reports of the shelling of Tamil civilians in the Sri Lanka Army-declared safe zone in which 378 civilians had been killed, while protesters claimed it to be nearly 3,000. The protest began on Spadina Avenue but abruptly spread past police cordons onto the Gardiner Expressway, a busy freeway in the city, bringing all vehicular traffic to a halt. The protesters, including {{women and children in}} strollers, said they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> blocking the Gardiner Expressway until they met with a representative from Premier Dalton McGuinty's office and got a promise for a clear course of action to stop the civil war in Sri Lanka. Police subsequently shut-down the Gardiner Expressway and Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, causing heavy traffic congestions throughout other Toronto streets and highways.|$|E
5|$|Throughout April {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured {{the whole of the}} Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the FAR forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far northwest. As well as fighting the war, Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly {{to people who}} had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 IP addresses had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' personal data. He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E
25|$|IWF {{filtering}} {{has been}} criticised as interfering with legitimate Internet activity while being ineffective against anyone intending to access objectionable content. One carefully argued discussion, while opposing {{such things as}} child pornography and terrorism, points out that filtering has side effects, as discussed in this section, and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> access to material such as images {{of child sexual abuse}} as it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> email, ftp, https, p2p, usenet, irc, or many other ways to access the same content. As there are simple encryption systems, it never can stop it - at best it just drives it underground and harder to assess and track.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of these}} varied uses, {{it is not}} {{practical}} to ban lasers from airspace.

For this reason, practical laser/aviation safety is based on informed users and informed pilots.|$|E
25|$|This outlook matched {{precisely}} Trotsky's {{theory of}} Permanent Revolution.

25|$|Around {{the time}} of the 35th annual March for Life in 2008, a Guttmacher Institute report was released, which {{revealed}} that the number of abortions performed in the United States dropped to 1.2 million in 2005.

25|$|A {{series of}} {{disasters}} impeded {{the development of}} the city during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: an earthquake, a 1575 smallpox epidemic, in 1590, 1608, and 1618, the Mapocho River floods, and, finally, the earthquake of 13 May 1647, which killed over 600 people and affected more than five thousand others.

25|$|Captain James Alden of Brooklyn was {{apparently}} confused by conflicting orders, {{to stay on}} the port side of the monitors and to stay {{to the right of the}} minefield, so he stopped his ship and signaled Farragut for instructions. Farragut <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the flagship; he ordered Captain Percival Drayton to send Hartford around Brooklyn and into the lead of the column. This took the ship into the torpedoes that had just sunk Tecumseh, but Farragut was confident that most of them had been submerged too long to be effective. His gamble paid off, and the entire column of 14 warships passed through unharmed.|$|E
