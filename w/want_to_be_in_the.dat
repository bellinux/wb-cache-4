Session musicians such as Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones regularly played in Denmark Street studios. In 1964, The Kinks recorded [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] in one of the basement studios.|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard, {{speaking}} {{in the voice of}} the upbuilding discourse at the end, says they are both wrong. They're both trying to find God in a childish way. Whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning. Art, science, dogma and ethics constantly change. We all <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right and never in the wrong. Once we find what we desire we find that it wasn't what we imagined it to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] {{is about}} an abusive romantic {{relationship}} that ends abruptly, with some critics comparing them to the relationship that Rihanna had with Brown. Kot noted that the single's lyrics compare a relationship to a fatal game of choice, while Andy Jill of The Independent wrote that the its title refers to a [...] "state of relationships". Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice described the song as a spare, suspenseful, violent torch song with a literal title. The Los Angeles Times Todd Martens wrote that although the song's lyrics are vague and find people speculating, they [...] "hint at a situation one probably doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of". Sasha Resende of The Michigan Daily wrote [...] "the ballad, which employs reckless gunplay as a not-so-subtle metaphor for a troubled relationship, achieves its seemingly morbid intent." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented {{that he had not}} really liked any of Elaine Stritch's appearances as Jack's mother on the series, writing that [...] "Jack's fear and loathing of his mother just feels claustrophobic and uncomfortable instead of funny, and I'm as eager to see the end of her visits as [...] usually is." [...] Sepinwall said that [...] "very little" [...] of [...] "Christmas Special" [...] worked. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> holiday spirit, but this is two Christmas duds in a row from 30 Rock, and we can't even blame the looming writers strike this time around." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning believed the show could have delivered a Christmas episode, but noted that their attempt at it [...] "was a little less than satisfying. The ideas were there, but the rhythm of the episode was off." [...] Nonetheless, Canning said the episode was not terrible. He enjoyed all the plots except for Liz's, writing that it did not quite fit, and that [...] "the overall result of Liz's plot just wasn't all that funny." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina for Paste found that there was nothing [...] "special" [...] about this episode. In his opinion, Liz should be featured in [...] "new and exciting plot line" [...] rather than helping Jack endure his troubles with his mother.|$|E

500|$|In the 2001–02 season, Evra {{switched}} to the number 17 shirt and was promoted to the first team on a permanent basis. In the team's first league match of the season against Laval, he started in the team's 2–1 win. Towards {{the end of the}} match, reserve left-back Jean-Charles Cirilli, who was starting in place of the regular starter José Cobos, suffered an injury, which required the player to be substituted out. As a consequence, Evra dropped back into the role and played {{out the rest of the}} match in the position. Following the match, due to injuries to both Cobos and Cirilli, Evra was informed by Salvioni he would take over the position. The young player disagreed with the manager's decision, declaring he was a forward, however after Salvioni informed him, [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team you play there," [...] Evra agreed to fill the role. Evra made his debut in the position in the team's following league match against Strasbourg, a 3–0 defeat. He appeared regularly in the campaign and, following the return of Cobos, was even allowed to play in his preferred left wing role. With the club in the midst of a promotion battle, Evra scored his first and only goal for Nice in his last match with the club, a 4–3 win over Laval. The victory placed Nice in third place, which resulted in the club earning promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time since 1997. For his performances, Evra was named to the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Ligue 2 Team of the Year in the left-back position.|$|E
500|$|On {{the balance}} between {{creating}} new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics {{in a way that}} works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, [...] "We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it." [...] About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create [...] "Marvel moments" [...] as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so [...] "If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car with the character having that experience." ...|$|E

The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center (renamed Epcot in 1996), which opened in 1982. While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, it is closer to a world's fair than a [...] "community of tomorrow". Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business.
