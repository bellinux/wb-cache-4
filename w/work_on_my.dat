5|$|In 1987, Studio Ghibli {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} create a film adaptation of Eiko Kadono's novel Kiki's Delivery Service. Miyazaki's <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Neighbor Totoro prevented him from directing the adaptation; Sunao Katabuchi was chosen as director, and Nobuyuki Isshiki was hired as script writer. Miyazaki's dissatisfaction of Isshiki's first draft led him to make changes to the project, ultimately taking the role of director. Kadono was unhappy with {{the differences between the}} book and the screenplay. Miyazaki and Suzuki visited Kadono and invited her to the studio; she allowed the project to continue. The film was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film after Miyazaki completed the storyboards and screenplay. Kiki's Delivery Service premiered on July 29, 1989. It earned ¥2.15 billion at the box office, and was the highest-grossing film in Japan in 1989.|$|E

According to Noah Callahan-Bever, who visited West during the recording sessions, [...] "when he hits a creative wall... he heads to another studio room to make progress on another song". West never slept a full night at the [...] "glass-enclosed mansion" [...] house he had rented, opting instead to take power naps in a studio chair or couch 90 minutes at a time. Engineers worked around the clock, as West bounced from room to room. This assiduous work ethic led to West employing two private chefs, one for hot food, and one for cold food.Before recording in the afternoon, West and most of his crew played games of 21 against locals at the Honolulu YMCA for leisure. Kid Cudi smoked marijuana in preparation and worked out on a treadmill, while RZA worked out in the weight room. West held breakfast each morning at his Diamond Head residence for his crew.|$|E

West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off Watch the Throne, a collaborative record with rapper Jay-Z. Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". Singer Beyoncé Knowles heard of the mixtape through her husband Jay-Z and was a fan of it. She subsequently invited Ocean to co-write [...] "I Miss You" [...] for her album 4. Discussing how she first heard of Ocean and Nostalgia, Ultra, she commented; [...] "Jay-Z had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn.

There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official.

[...] "You Lost Me" [...] was released as the final single from Bionic, and peaked at {{number one on the}} US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and number 28 on the Adult Contemporary.

It was nominated in the category of Award for Best Original Song at the 68th Golden Globe Awards in January 2011.

500|$|By {{the end of}} her Arena Tour 2003–2004, Hamasaki {{had grown}} {{dissatisfied}} with her position in Avex: she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person. Along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums (which she thought had been rushed), this led her to begin <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Story (December 2004) early. In contrast with her previous albums, My Story had no set theme, nor did Hamasaki attempt to write [...] "something good" [...] or even [...] "something that would give people hope"; rather, she simply wrote freely and honestly. As a result, the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career. She approached the composition of the music with the same freedom as the lyrics, with the album's notable rock overtones expressing her liking for rock music. She was so pleased with the result that she declared My Story the first album she felt satisfied with. My Story and its singles, [...] "Moments", [...] "Inspire", and [...] "Carols", all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, My Story became Hamasaki's last million-selling studio album according to Oricon. From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide My Story arena tour, her first album-based tour. Also in January, she began working with Lamoureux Orchestra to create My Story Classical, a classical version of My Story; the album served as an [...] "alter-ego" [...] of the mostly aggressive My Story. The orchestra also created a classical version of [...] "A Song Is Born", which was included on My Story Classical and which Hamasaki performed {{at the opening of the}} Expo 2005.|$|E
500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E
