5|$|A level ends <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> point-scoring {{objects are}} gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or {{absorbed by the}} bubble. At this point, if the bubble {{is large enough to}} have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{migration}} to the peninsula continued into the 16th century, when new settlements such as Kandalaksha and Porya-Guba were established. Kola was first mentioned in 1565.

Monastery votchinas greatly expanded during the 17th century, but were abolished in 1764, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kola Peninsula peasants became state peasants.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 charter reforms {{included}} {{consolidation of}} {{city and county}} offices. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices. The new charter allowed for their consolidation, but litigation ensued about which county offices were actually state offices, and thus immune from the city's jurisdiction. A State Supreme Court case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently elected official.|$|E

5|$|After {{his injury}} healed, Orton joined the Evolution stable, which {{consisted}} of Ric Flair, Triple H, and relative newcomer, Batista.

In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping Triple H overcome challenges for the World Heavyweight Championship. Orton joined Triple H in a six-man Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, involved primarily to secure Triple H's title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed to fulfill its purpose and Triple H went on to eliminate Goldberg and thus retain his title.|$|E

5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required {{the approval of}} a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt {{in the minds of many}} legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E

After {{the release of}} Night Fishing, the band began {{looking for a new}} management company to sign a contract with. Originally, the members did not want to leave Sapporo, especially guitarist Motoharu Iwadera and bassist Ami Kusakari. Of the five management companies they were choosing between, none of them needed the band to relocate, except for Hipland Management. Vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi realized that staying in Sapporo was against the band's goal of making music for a much wider group of listeners, and was surprised <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members agreed with him. In Spring 2008, the band moved to Tokyo from Hokkaido.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{standard}} result by Smale {{states that}} n dimensional strongly cooperative dynamical systems can have arbitrary dynamics when restricted to unordered invariant hyperspaces. In this paper {{this result is}} extended to <b>the</b> case <b>when</b> <b>all</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongly cooperative system are bounded and converge towards {{one of only two}} equilibria outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hyperplane. An application is given in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> strongly cooperative systems of reaction diffusion equations. It is shown that such a system can have a continuum of spatially inhomogeneous steady states, even <b>when</b> <b>all</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying reaction system converge to one of only three equilibria. 1...|$|R

5|$|Formal {{nominations}} {{began the}} following day. Hardin {{felt as though}} he had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy, although some loyal delegates continued to vote for him. Delegate John Stockdale Rhea nominated Stone. Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant, with Hardin's withdrawal, Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone, maintaining a unified party. That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel. Stone was further incensed <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel, as the two men had previously agreed. In retaliation, some Stone supporters began to back Hardin. Seeing the breakdown of the Stone-Goebel alliance, Hardin reversed his withdrawal. After numerous ballots, the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one-third of the votes. No deliberations were held on Sunday, June 25, and when the delegates reconvened on Monday, June 26, the hall was filled with police per Redwine's request. Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. Another delegate appealed Redwine's decision, and, in violation of parliamentary rule, Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. Angered by Redwine's obviously biased rulings, delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns, singing, yelling, and standing on chairs. Although voting was attempted, many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on. When the voting—such as it was—ended, the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast, but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates. Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted, and the meeting adjourned for the day.|$|E
