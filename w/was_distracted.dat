While concentrating on SanFrancisco, Amatsukaze did not notice the approach of Helena, which fired several full broadsides at Amatsukaze from close range and knocked her out of the action. The heavily damaged Amatsukaze escaped under cover of a smoke screen while Helena <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by an attack by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare.|$|E
5|$|Sonjay Dutt fought Jay Lethal in {{the next}} bout on the card. Lethal was {{accompanied}} to the ring by SoCal Val. The contest lasted 8 minutes and 24 seconds. Dutt was the victor in the encounter by using a roll-up pinning maneuver on Lethal while he <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by Val.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} event {{began with}} a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. The champions, La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvain Grenier), defended their titles against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when they executed a 3D on Duprée. As D-Von covered Duprée, Rob Conway, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee <b>was</b> <b>distracted.</b> Duprée then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship.|$|E

5|$|As {{the match}} between Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage {{was about to}} begin, Ted DiBiase {{appeared}} and {{announced that he had}} purchased Sapphire. Rhodes walked down the aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee <b>was</b> <b>distracted.</b> Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not {{to wait until the}} larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E
5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. After {{the first few}} months he found the pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E

The duration of the encounter was eight minutes and six seconds.

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Sting, and the challenger, A.J. Styles. During the 15 minutes the match lasted, Styles {{executed}} his aerial technique the Spiral Tap, in which he jumps {{off one of the}} top padded turnbuckles, spins and flips in mid-air before landing on his opponent. He then ascended the turnbuckle to perform the maneuver once again, but <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by Angle and Booker T. Later, Styles missed a pele kick on Sting, which allowed Sting to counter with a small package pin on Styles to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|The semifinals {{were held}} on the September 2 episode of Impact!. Shelley and Waltman {{defeated}} the team of Hoyt and Konnan in the first semifinal match at 4 minutes and 22 seconds.

Hoyt went to get the referee, giving Waltman the ability to {{hit him in the}} groin and follow-up by slamming him face-first into the mat with his signature X-Factor maneuver.|$|E

5|$|A tribute video played next, {{highlighting}} the wrestlers from ECW that had died between the promotion's end in 2001 and One Night Stand. A three-way dance was next, with Tajiri facing Little Guido Maritato and Super Crazy. Tajiri was accompanied {{to the ring}} by The Sinister Minister and Mikey Whipwreck, and Guido was accompanied by his fellow F.B.I. members. One {{of the highlights of}} the match occurred when Super Crazy deliver a moonsault off the balcony onto {{all the members of the}} F.B.I. Guido was the first eliminated when Whipwreck delivered a Whipper Snapper while the referee <b>was</b> <b>distracted.</b> Tajiri picked up the three count to eliminate Guido. Super Crazy won the match after performing a moonsault off the top rope onto Tajiri, getting the three-count in the process.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E
5|$|Although a British frigate {{squadron}} under Josias Rowley {{was under}} orders {{to eliminate the}} French raiders, Rowley <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by the planned invasion of Île Bonaparte, which began the following week. Combined with limited British resources in the region, this allowed the French frigates significant freedom to attack British interests across the Ocean. The attack on Île Bonaparte was however part of a wider British strategy to seize and capture French raiding bases, {{and the success of}} the operation severely limited future French operations as Hamelin's squadron was required for the defence of Île de France. As a result, this was the last successful attack on a British merchant convoy in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

5|$|Des Roches {{used his}} new {{authority}} to begin stripping his opponents of their estates, circumventing {{the courts and}} legal process. Complaints from powerful barons such as William Marshal's son Richard grew, and they argued that Henry was failing to protect their legal rights {{as described in the}} 1225 charters. A fresh civil war broke out between des Roches and Richard's followers. Des Roches sent armies into Richard's lands in Ireland and South Wales. In response, Richard allied himself with Prince Llywelyn, and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in England. Henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> at home.|$|E
5|$|Habsburg saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, though she was not {{significantly}} engaged during the battle.

The ship's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s, before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola in 1886. She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 18991900.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier {{by letter}} urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then turned}} his sights to Heyman's other client, Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel. On September 15, Punk faced Axel and Heyman in a No Disqualication, Handicap {{elimination}} match at Night of Champions, {{in which he}} made Axel submit, leaving only Heyman left. In the process of attacking Heyman, Ryback attacked Punk and placed Heyman on top of Punk for the pinfall. A month later, at Battleground, Punk defeated Ryback after executing a low blow, while the referee <b>was</b> <b>distracted</b> by Heyman attempting to interfere in the match. On October 14, Punk defeated Axel in a Beat the Clock challenge match to determine the stipulation for his rematch with Ryback at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, which Punk chose to be a two-on-one Handicap match in the Hell in a Cell also involving Heyman. At the event on October 27, Punk defeated Heyman and Ryback.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match of}} the pay-per-view {{was supposed to}} be Ludvig Borga vs. Tatanka. The two were engaged in a feud that began prior to Survivor Series 1993. Tatanka had been undefeated in the WWF since his debut in 1991. Borga ended this streak on the October 30, 1993 edition of WWF Superstars (taped on September 28, 1993), when he hit Tatanka with a steel chair while the referee <b>was</b> <b>distracted.</b> As a results of storyline injuries from this attack and the beating he suffered afterward at the hands of Borga and Yokozuna, Tatanka was forced to miss the main event match at Survivor Series. Although Tatanka defeated Borga by disqualification on the December 20, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw, the bitterness between the two remained.|$|E
