40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of warm rolled high magnesium aluminum-magnesium alloys have shown that excellent tensile properties can be developed in these materials. Several questions raised in these previous efforts regarding recrystallization and precipitation of the intermetallic 3 phase are addressed in this thesis. It is shown that, for temperatures T < T (where T is the solvus temperature) the only microstructural change is the precipitation of the 3 phase and no recrystallization occurs, even with prior cold work. Further studies of microstructures developed during <b>warm</b> <b>working,</b> with and without prior cold work, also indicate that precipitation and recovery dominate the microstructural changes in warm rolling at temperatures below the solvus for the alloy. Recrystallization will occur readily, but only at temperature {{in excess of the}} solvus.

40|$|The {{properties}} of ultrahigh carbon steels (UHCS) are {{strongly influenced by}} aluminum additions. Hardness studies of quenched UHCS-Al alloys reveal that the temperature {{for the start of}} transformation increases with increases in aluminum content. It is shown that this change {{is a function of the}} atomic percent of solute and of the valence state when comparisons are made with UHCSs containing silicon and tin as solutes. The thermal expansion of UHCSs with dilute aluminum additions shows no discontinuity in the vicinity of the ferrite-austenite transformation temperature. This is the result of a three phase region of ferrite, carbides and austenite. The slope of the expansion curve is higher in the austenite range than in the ferrite range as a result of the dissolution of carbon in austenite with temperature.

In order to investigate the <b>warm</b> <b>working</b> behavior of Zr- 1 %Nb alloy, all data were analysed stepwise and the step-bystep procedure was provided. The occurrence of the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) phenomena at different working conditions was analysed by the work hardening rate analysis. The stress-strain curve of many samples was identical to the typical DRX stress-strain curve which consists of a single peak stress followed by a gradual decrement toward the steadystate stress. Microstructural observations showed that at low temperatures and high strain rates the flow curves can be explained by localized deformation as a consequence of shear band formation. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the DRX has taken places through a continuous mechanism. At high Zener-Hollomon (Z) parameter a drop in flow stress was detected as a consequence of adiabatic deformation heating.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} popular {{approaches}} to ultrafine grain formation within bulk samples is severe plastic deformation (SPD).

Subsequent analyses by orientation imaging microscopy revealed that {{the nature and extent of}} refinement depend upon the processing route. In MAC, fragmentation occurs mainly by means of a dense, homogeneous network of low angle boundaries (LAB, 2 ≤ θ ≤ 15 °) delimiting subgrains, and only a few strain-induced high angle boundaries (HAB, θ ≥ 15 °) are observed in localised regions of cold worked samples.

During deformation at this temperature, lamellae of the α phase fragmented via a boundary-grooving mechanism.
