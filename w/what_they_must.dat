25|$|Players {{can find}} loot (such as clothing, weapons, and armor) {{throughout}} the game world and collect it. Players can trade items for currency and better equipment. Trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non-player characters, such as shopkeepers, and often uses a specialized trading screen. Purchased items {{go into the}} player's inventory. Some games turn inventory management into a logistical challenge by limiting {{the size of the}} player's inventory, thus forcing the player to decide <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> carry at the time. This can be done by limiting the maximum weight that a player can carry, by employing a system of arranging items in a virtual space, or by simply limiting the number of items that can be held.|$|E
500|$|The {{court also}} {{evaluated}} {{the constitutionality of}} the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a [...] "violent video game." [...] Generally, [...] "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> say." [...] However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of [...] "purely factual and uncontroversial information" [...] in advertising. However, the labeling requirement of [...] "violent video game" [...] is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information. Consequently, the court found that the Act is unconstitutional.|$|E

They {{instructed}} the Marranos in the tenets and ceremonies of the Jewish religion; held meetings in which they taught them <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> believe and observe according to the Mosaic law; and enabled them to circumcise themselves and their children. They furnished them with prayer-books; explained the fast-days; read with them the history of their people and their Law; announced to them the coming of the Passover; procured unleavened bread for them for that festival, as well as kosher meat throughout the year; encouraged them to live in conformity with the law of Moses, and persuaded them that there was no law and no truth except the Jewish religion." [...] These were the charges brought by the government of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile against the Jews. They constituted the grounds for their expulsion and banishment in 1492, so they could not subvert conversos. Jews {{who did not want to}} leave Spain had to accept baptism as a sign of conversion.|$|E

60|$|And here I would {{note the}} great benefit of party distinctions in saving {{the people at}} large the trouble of thinking. Hesiod divides mankind into three classes--those who think for themselves, those who think as others think, {{and those who do}} not think at all. The second class {{comprises}} the great mass of society; for most people require a set creed and a file-leader. Hence the origin of party, which means a large body of people, some few of whom think, and all the rest talk. The former take the lead and discipline the latter, prescribing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> say, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> approve, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> hoot at, whom they must support, but, above all, whom they must hate; for no one can be a right good partisan who is not a thoroughgoing hater.|$|E

30|$|History is a {{clock that}} people use {{to tell the}} {{political}} and cultural time of the day. It is also a compass that people use to find themselves on the map of human geography.
