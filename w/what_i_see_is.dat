Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence [...] "I like what I see", the clause <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the object of the verb like in the main clause. (An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has zero as its antecedent.) ...|$|E

How fortunate were we who did not own an acre of these shores, who had not renounced our title to the whole. One who knew how to appropriate the true value of this world would be the poorest man in it. The poor rich man! all he has is what he has bought. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> mine.

6000|$|Homely, though, is an ill-chosen word. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> not {{precisely}} homely. A girl of Villette stands there--a girl fresh from her pensionnat. She is very comely, with the beauty indigenous to this country. She looks well-nourished, fair, and fat of flesh. Her cheeks are round, her eyes good; {{her hair is}} abundant. She is handsomely dressed. She is not alone; her escort consists of three persons--two being elderly; these she addresses as [...] "Mon Oncle" [...] and [...] "Ma Tante." [...] She laughs, she chats; good-humoured, buxom, and blooming, she looks, at all points, the bourgeoise belle.|$|E

In other words, that she can't forgive Miss de Barral for being a woman and behaving like a woman. And yet this is not only reasonable and natural, but it is her only chance. A woman against the world has no resources but in herself. Her only means of action is to be what she is. You understand what I mean." ...|$|E

The English are very romantic—the most romantic people in the world, if that’s what you mean. They do the strangest things from the force of passion—even those of whom you would least expect it. They marry their cooks, they marry their coachmen, and their romances always have the most miserable end. I’m sure this one would be wretched. How can you pretend that such a flaming barbarian can be worked into any civilisation? <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> a fine old race—one of the oldest and most honourable in England, people with every {{tradition}} of good conduct and high principle—and a dreadful disreputable vulgar little woman, who hasn’t an idea of what such things are, trying to force her way into it.

And I do hear something coming 'flip-flap' in the dark; {{and then there is}} the awfulest war-whoop ever heard outside of Madison Square Garden at a Buffalo Bill matinée. And up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable Indian. The lamp in the hall shines on him, and I fail to recognize Mr. J. T. Little Bear, alumnus of the class of '91. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> a Cherokee brave, and the warpath is what he has been travelling. Firewater and other things have got him going. His buckskin is hanging in strings, and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen's. The dust of miles is on his moccasins, and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear. But in his arms he brings that kid, his eyes half closed, with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the Indian's collar.|$|E

Then, you know, at home we are always talking about people, and discussing them; but we always talk of each person for what he is in himself, and I always thought a person could refine himself if he tried, and was sincere, and not conceited. But he seems to judge people according to their origin and locality and calling, and to believe that all refinement must come from just such training and circumstances as his own. Without exactly saying so, he puts everything else quite out of the question. He doesn't appear to dream that there can be any different opinion. He tramples upon all that I have been taught to believe; and though I cling the closer to my idols, I can't help, now and then, trying myself by his criterions; and then I find myself wanting in every civilized trait, and my whole life coarse and poor, and all my associations hopelessly degraded. I think his ideas are hard and narrow, and I believe that even my little experience would prove them false; but then, they are his, and I can't reconcile them with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> good in him." ...|$|E

"Young gentlemen," [...] he said, {{when they}} {{presented}} themselves, and had at his request seated themselves on two boxes {{which served as}} chairs, [...] "in what I am {{going to say to}} you, mind, I express no wish even of the slightest. I simply state that I require two officers for a service of extreme danger. I want to send a message into Lucknow. None of the officers of the English regiments can speak the language with any fluency, and those of the Madras Fusiliers speak the dialects of Southern India. Therefore it is among the volunteers, who all belong to the northwest, that I must look. I have no doubt that there are many of them who would undertake the service, and whose knowledge of the language would be nearly perfect, but there are reasons why I ask you whether you will volunteer for the work. In the first place, you have already three times passed, while in disguise, as natives; and in the second, your figures being slight, and still a good deal under the height you will attain, render your disguise far less easy to be detected than that of a full-grown man would be. If you undertake it, you will have a native guide, who last night arrived from Lucknow with a message to me, having passed through the enemy's lines. You understand, young gentlemen, the service is one of great honor and credit if accomplished, but {{it is also one of}} the greatest risk. I cannot so well intrust the mission to the native alone, because I dare not put on paper the tidings I wish conveyed, and it is possible, however faithful he may be, that he might, if taken and threatened with death, reveal the message with which he is charged. I see by your faces what your answer is about to be, but I will not hear it now. Go first to your father. Tell him exactly what I have told you, and then send me the answer if he declines to part with you--bring it me if he consents to your going. Remember that in yielding <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> your own inclination, to his natural anxiety, you will not fall in the very least from the high position in which you stand in my regard.
