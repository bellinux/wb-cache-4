5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E
5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E

50|$|A third route, {{particularly}} difficult and rated TD+, {{runs along the}} south ridge and <b>is</b> very rarely <b>climbed.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>climbed</b> {{the first time on}} the 24 June 1969 by a Yugoslavian party (T. Sbrizaj, S. Semraj and B. Naglic).Other routes have <b>been</b> <b>climbed,</b> but very rarely repeated.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} routes {{typically}} used to climb Mount Mallory. It can <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> from the East via Green Pass from the Meysan Lake Trailhead, {{or it can}} <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> from the west via Arc Pass. The East slopes present the most obvious route, and the mountain <b>is</b> often <b>climbed</b> in conjunction with Mount Irvine.|$|R
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in an Ultimate X match, which {{involved}} A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin, and the champion, Petey Williams, who {{was accompanied by}} Coach D'Amore. D'Amore was banned from ringside in the opening minutes of the contest. Styles at one point <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in mid-air to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in mid-air and land {{on his back in}} the center of the ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both hanging on the ropes, each holding one end of the belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed on the mat, he was declared the official winner.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> the ladder to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get the belts and win.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} no fully {{accepted}} record of the mountain having <b>been</b> <b>climbed</b> since 1935 and this would mean it has never <b>been</b> <b>climbed</b> from the Nepalese side. This is perhaps remarkable because from Everest Base Camp, along with Pumori and Khumbutse (which have both <b>been</b> <b>climbed),</b> the mountain <b>is</b> very noticeable being less than 5 km away. An attempt on Lingtren was made in 2013. In Hoger dan de Dhaulagiri, [...] claimed he had climbed Lingtren in 1993 saying he started in Nepal and then crossed into Tibet. This claim has, however, been discounted.|$|R

It may have <b>been</b> <b>climbed</b> in 1924.|$|R
25|$|Shortly after midnight, a 25-year-old woman {{suffered}} a fractured bone after being {{shot in the}} leg by a live round fired from New Barnsley RUC base. The base {{was the target of}} a gun and grenade attack. At the Larnak Way interface in West Belfast, loyalists tried to enter the nationalist area at 3am. A shot fired from the nationalist side struck a 14-year-old Protestant boy who <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> over the security fence. It hit him in the shoulder and punctured a lung. One source reported that warning shots had been fired, while another said the teenager was wounded when an IRA unit launched a gun and grenade attack on a military base near the interface. Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) gunmen also opened fire on British soldiers in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{stuck the}} zoo twice in 1954, {{first with the}} death of Albert Barnett the zoo foreman. Barnett died after a finger became {{infected}} in what was initially thought to be a minor injury sustained at work. In August, another staff member, 65-year-old Frank Lane, who had also worked at the zoo since its opening like Barnett, was killed in a much publicised accident. Lane had just fed a young elephant, Kassala, and <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> back through the rails between the stalls when Jamuna swung her trunk knocking him into the wall and killing him instantly. Barnett had been Jamuna's regular keeper and it was reported she had been upset since his death. It is believed Lane's death {{was the result of a}} tragic accident rather than a deliberate attack. Jamuna spent the rest of her life without incident.|$|E
25|$|Southwest Airlines Flight 3472 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight operating from New Orleans International Airport, LA to Orlando International Airport, FL.

Debris {{from the engine}} punctured {{the left side of}} the fuselage causing a loss of cabin pressure and damaged the wing and empennage. Oxygen masks were deployed to passengers while the crew initiated an emergency descent to 10,000 feet. The aircraft then diverted to Pensacola International Airport for a safe landing on runway 17 about 20 minutes later without further incident. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, there were no injuries.|$|E

25|$|Johnston {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales in a Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania in March 1999. He opened the bowling with Brett Lee {{who would make}} his debut for Australia later that year. Johnston's first wicket was that of Michael Di Venuto; he took one more wicket that day, but after play ended {{on the second day}} Johnston suffered a broken arm as the team coach drove off while he <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> on. He played his only List A match for them in October that year, against Queensland. He played four Pura Cup matches for them in 2000 before his career took him to Ireland. New South Wales failed to notify Johnston that his contract had not been renewed and he was instead informed by a team-mate. He returned to club cricket where he represented Campbelltown, North Sydney, and Mosman, captaining the last.|$|E
25|$|After a {{backstage}} segment featuring Dorian Roldán, Jeff Jarrett, Karen Jarrett, Konnan and Kurt Angle, {{the fourth}} match {{of the event}} saw Joe Líder and Psicosis face {{each other in a}} Lucha de Apuestas. Despite Psicosis announcing before the event that he would be betting his hair in case of a loss in the Parejas Suicidas match, it was announced that the match would be for Líder's hair and Psicosis' mask. However, before the match began, Líder attacked Psicosis and ripped his mask off, revealing his burned face and forcing the match to be changed to a Hair vs. Hair match. Towards the end of the hardcore brawl, Líder threw a garbage can into Psisocis' face as he <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> to the top rope. However, when Líder went to suplex his opponent back down to the ring, Psicosis countered the move and dropped him with a flip piledriver through a table and a ladder, both propped up against the corner, and then pinned him to win the match. Afterwards, Psicosis continued the assault on his rival, dropping him onto a pile of thumbtacks, before having him shaved bald. After getting backstage, Líder and Psicosis continued brawling in the locker room, before being broken up by security.|$|E
500|$|The CAB {{concluded}} that the accident was due to [...] "the pilot's unwise decision {{to embark on a}} flight" [...] that required instrument flying skills he had not proved to have. A contributing factor was the pilot's unfamiliarity with the old-style attitude gyroscope fitted on board the aircraft, which may have caused him to believe that he <b>was</b> <b>climbing</b> when he was in fact descending (an example of spatial disorientation). Another contributing factor was the [...] "seriously [...] inadequate" [...] weather briefing provided to the pilot, which [...] "failed to even mention adverse flying condition which should have been highlighted".|$|E
