These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add that we need to have our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that this is an issue that we care deeply about. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E

5000|$|In How Everyone Became Depressed: The Rise and Fall of the Nervous Breakdown (2013), Edward Shorter, a {{professor}} of psychiatry {{and the history of}} medicine, argues for a return to the old-fashioned concept of nervous illness: About half of them are depressed. Or at least that is the diagnosis that they got when they were put on antidepressants. ... They go to work but they are unhappy and uncomfortable; they are somewhat anxious; they are tired; they have various physical pains - and they tend to obsess about the whole business. There is a term for what they have, and it is a good old-fashioned term that has gone out of use. They have nerves or a nervous illness. It is an illness not just of mind or brain, but a disorder of the entire body. ... We have a package here of five symptoms-mild depression, some anxiety, fatigue, somatic pains, and obsessive thinking. ... We have had nervous illness for centuries. When you are too nervous to function ... it is a nervous breakdown. But that term has vanished from medicine, although not from the way we speak. ... The nervous patients of yesteryear are the depressives of today. That is the bad news. ... There is a deeper illness that drives depression and the symptoms of mood. We can call this deeper illness something else, or invent a neologism, but <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> discussion off depression and onto this deeper disorder in the brain and body. That is the point. Edward Shorter, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto.|$|E
5000|$|The episodes {{received}} {{criticism for}} inaccuracy. Sue Jacob, {{a teacher at}} the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said EastEnders presented a [...] "poor picture of midwifery practice". During Janets birth, Honey was refused an epidural while in pain, and later she was told that her baby had Downs syndrome alone, without her partner or family there to support her. Jacob commented, [...] "Women are vulnerable after giving birth and they need support systems in place ... The person caring for her is repeatedly referred to as a nurse in the episode but {{there is no way that}} a nurse would be in charge after birth. The midwife would also have been open and honest and said <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> baby checked out and we will get your partner ... What the soaps do is set scenes which prompt people to talk about things which are affecting their lives. We are concerned people will wrongly think this Downs syndrome story shows what really happens, and that if you have a problem there is no one there to support you. Showing something like this is not helpful." [...] Furthermore, Jacob noted that Honey was left alone for a long time to worry about the baby, which appeared rigid, and not floppy, as babies with DS do. In Jacobs opinion, a midwife would have been repeatedly in and out of the room to check on the mother. Additionally, one episode showed a health visitor reprimanding Honey for refusing Downs syndrome screening and Karen Reay, director of the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association called the episode [...] "insensitive and patronising". She added that the episode contained [...] "glaring anomalies", giving new mothers a [...] "fictitious and misleading" [...] view of health visitors, which could [...] "damage relationships with health professionals".|$|E
