5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E

5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal. The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October. It is often {{one of the first}} mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory. The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long-lasting. The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida, and west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it has probably been introduced <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington, where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E

5|$|Yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} {{have been}} reported flocking to Banksia cones ten days after bushfire as the follicles open. <b>With</b> <b>pine</b> trees, they prefer green cones, nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot, then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed. A cockatoo spends about twenty minutes on each pine cone.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria, {{commonly}} known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.|$|E

5|$|Lithium has a {{very low}} density (0.534 g/cm3), {{comparable}} <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) is more than 60% denser. Furthermore, apart from helium and hydrogen, it is less dense than any liquid element, being only two thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium.|$|E
5|$|Pine Island Glacier (PIG) {{is a large}} ice stream, and {{the fastest}} melting glacier in Antarctica, {{responsible}} for about 25% of Antarctica's ice loss. The glacier ice streams flow west-northwest along {{the south side of}} the Hudson Mountains into Pine Island Bay, Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy (USN) air photos, 1960–66, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in association <b>with</b> <b>Pine</b> Island Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river <b>with</b> <b>Pine</b> Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|At {{the western}} end of the tunnel, Highway58 emerges as a divided highway in Thorold. It meets an {{interchange}} <b>with</b> <b>Pine</b> Street; the eastbound on-ramp from Pine Street features a stop sign and no merging lane prior to entering the Thorold Tunnel. West of Pine Street, the route passes beneath a Trillium Railway line and curves slightly southwest. It encounters an interchange with Collier Street, gradually curving to the northwest and passing beneath Richmond Street. Highway58 ends at a complicated interchange with both St. Davids Road as well as Highway406 {{on the edge of the}} Niagara Escarpment.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where {{it is likely to}} have been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have been}} introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E

50|$|Hygrophorus latitabundus {{is found}} in {{coniferous}} forests, forming ectomycorrhizal relationships exclusively <b>with</b> <b>pines</b> (Pinus). The fungus fruits in autumn and shows a preference for calcareous soils. Its occurrence is rare, though it is abundant there where it is established.|$|R
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore}} be located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the {{committee}} met with Lutyens in January 1919 to discuss options for the memorial. Lutyens argued against {{the committee}}'s initial proposed location on Asylum Green in favour of Watts Park, which the committee agreed to. Lutyen's initial design consisted of a large ceremonial pillar with a substantial archway on either side, each archway supporting a soldier lying on a sarcophagus. This was rejected due to the likely cost and instead Lutyens suggested a single empty sarcophagus or cenotaph, supported by a plinth {{on top of a}} pillar, <b>with</b> <b>pine</b> cones mounted on urns standing on each side. This was agreed to at a public meeting in September and detailed work on the project began. The London firm of Holloway Brothers were selected as the contractor for the memorial; the project was completed to time at a total cost of £9,845.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing <b>with</b> <b>pine.</b> It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E
50|$|Ilex ambigua, {{grows in}} {{many types of}} sandy habitat, such as sand scrub and hammocks and {{hardwood}} forests and woodlands. It may grow <b>with</b> <b>pines</b> such as loblolly, slash, and shortleaf pine, and oak species. It sometimes grows with its relative, American holly.|$|R
