50|$|An {{abundance}} of plants have taken root in Newport Bay. Each {{of the plants}} has adapted to the saltwater-marsh habitat, known as a saltmarsh. These plants are known as halophytes, and have adapted to grow submerged in saltwater. Common halophytes found in the Back Bay include: saltmarsh bird's beak (Cordylanthus maritimus), fleshy jaumea, sea lavender, brewer's salt brush, sea blite, and alkali heath. There are also coastal plant communities scattered throughout the land surrounding the Back Bay. This includes grassland and coastal sage scrub. Native sage scrub varieties include California sagebrush and buckwheat. However, recently the Back Bay {{has been known to}} be home to various plant invaders. These non-native species include <b>wild</b> <b>mustards</b> and pampas grass.|$|R

In North America, {{these include the}} shoots of common milkweed, Solomon's seal, wood sorrel (usually eaten with the leaves), {{blackberry}} and raspberry (peeled), chickweeds, galinsoga, common purslane, Japanese knotweed, saxifrage, cleavers, wild leeks, wild onion, nodding onion, field garlic, wild garlic, winter cress and other <b>wild</b> <b>mustards,</b> thistles (de-thorned), stinging nettles and wood nettles (cooked), burdock, bellworts, jewelweed, spiderwort, violets, carrion flower, twisted-stalk, amaranth, pine and slippery elm, among many others. Also, some wild plants with edible rhizomes (underground, horizontal stems) can be found, such as cattail, ground nut, Solomon's seal and false Solomon's seal. Wild edible tubers include arrowhead, and many more. Wild edible stems, like their domestic relatives, are usually only good when young and growing. Many of these also require preparation (as do many domestic plants, such as the potato), so {{it is wise to}} read up on the plant before experimenting with eating it.|$|R
60|$|A {{friendly}} {{visit from}} Ebenezer Clarkson of Selkirk, a medical gentleman in whose experience and ingenuity I have much confidence, {{as well as}} his personal regard for myself. He is quite sensible of the hesitation of speech of which I complain, and thinks it arises from the stomach. Recommends the <b>wild</b> <b>mustard</b> as an aperient. But the brightest ray of hope is the chance that I may get some mechanical aid made by Fortune at Broughton Street, which may enable me to mount a pony with ease, and to walk without torture. This would, indeed, be almost a restoration of my youth, at least of a green old age full of enjoyment. The shutting one out from the face of living nature is almost worse than sudden death.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} open spaces {{covered with a}} {{vegetation}} almost as interesting as the canes and the trees: this was where what were called [...] "weeds" [...] were allowed to flourish. Here were the thorn-apple, chenopodium, sow-thistle, <b>wild</b> <b>mustard,</b> redweed, viper's bugloss, and others, both native and introduced, in dense thickets five or six feet high. It was difficult to push one's way through these thickets, and one was always in dread of treading on a snake. At another spot fennel flourished by itself, {{as if it had}} some mysterious power, perhaps its peculiar smell, of keeping other plants at a proper distance. It formed quite a thicket, and grew to a height of ten or twelve feet. This spot was a favourite haunt of mine, as it was in a waste place at the furthest point from the house, a wild solitary spot where I could spend long hours by myself watching the birds. But I also loved the fennel for itself, its beautiful green feathery foliage and the smell of it, also the taste, so that whenever I visited that secluded spot I would rub the crushed leaves in my palms and chew the small twigs for their peculiar fennel flavour.|$|E
60|$|But what a {{contrast}} was there! For an instant she could scarcely {{believe that she}} had left the ridge with her husband's savage outcry in her ears, and in her eyes the swift vision of his furious cavalcade. The boundary meadow was hidden by the soft lines of graceful willows in whose dim recesses the figures of the passionate horsemen seemed to have melted forever. There was nothing now to interrupt the long vista of peaceful beauty that stretched before her through this lonely hollow to the distant sleeping hills. The bursting barn in the foreground, heaped with grain that fringed its eaves and bristled from its windows and doors until its unlovely bulk was hidden in trailing feathery outlines; the gentle flutter of wings and soothing twitter of swallows and jays around its open rafters, and the drifting shadows of a few circling crows above it; the drowsy song of bees on the <b>wild</b> <b>mustard</b> that half hid its walls with yellow bloom; the sound of faintly-trickling water in one of those old Indian-haunted springs that had given its name to the locality; all these for an instant touched the senses of this hard, fierce woman as she had not been touched since she was a girl. For one brief moment the joys of peace and that matured repose that never had been hers flashed upon her; but with it came the savage consciousness that even now it was being wrested away, and the thought fired her blood again. She listened eagerly for a second {{in the direction of the}} meadow; there was no report of fire-arms--there was yet time to prepare the barn for defence. She ran to the front of the building and seized the latch of the half-closed door. A little feminine cry that was half a laugh came from within, with the rapid rustle of a skirt and as the door swung open a light figure vanished through the rear window. The slanting sunlight falling in the shadowed interior disclosed only the single erect figure of the school-master John Ford.|$|E

6000|$|The {{next morning}} saw the Expedition afoot at six a.m., {{determined}} {{to make up for}} a half by the whole day's work so long intended. The track struck eastward, and issued from the dull hollow, Majrá el-Ruways, by a made road about {{a mile and a half}} long, a cornice cut in the stony flanks of a hill whose head projected southwards into the broad Wady Hujayl ("the Little Partridge"). This line seems to drain inland; presently it bends round by the east and feeds the Wady Dámah. Rain must lately have fallen, for the earth is [...] "purfled flowers," [...] pink, white, and yellow. The latter is the tint prevailing in Midian, often suggesting the careless European wheat-field, in which [...] "shillock" [...] or <b>wild</b> <b>mustard</b> rears its gamboge head above the green. Midian wants not only the charming oleander and the rugged terebinth, typical of the Desert; but also the [...] "blood of Adonis," [...] the lovely anemone which lights up the Syrian landscape like the fisherman's scarlet cap in a sea-piece. This stage introduced us to the Hargul (Harjal, Rhazya stricta), whose perfume filled the valley with the clean smell of the henna-bloom, the Eastern privet--Mr. Clarke said [...] "wallflowers." [...] Our mules ate it greedily, whilst the country animals, they say, refuse it: the flowers, dried and pounded, cure by fumigation [...] "pains in the bones." [...] Here also we saw for the first time the quaint distaff-shape of the purple red Masrúr (Cynomorium coccineum, Linn.), from which the Bedawi [...] "cook bread." [...] It is eaten simply peeled and sun-dried, when it has a vegetable taste slightly astringent as if by tannin, something between a potato and a turnip; or its rudely pounded flour is made into balls with soured milk. This styptic, I am told by Mr. R. B. Sharpe, of the British Museum, was long supposed to be peculiar to Malta; hence its pre-Linnaean name (Fungus Melitensis).[EN#2] Now it is known to occur through the Mediterranean to India. Let me here warn future collectors of botany in Midian that throughout the land the vegetable kingdom follows the rule of the mineral: every march shows something new; and he who neglects to gather specimens, especially of the smaller flowers, in one valley, will perhaps find none of them in those adjoining.|$|E

40|$|Oilseeds {{are very}} popular edibles {{that are often}} used to enhance the fibre content of baked goods, and {{specific}} types are used for preserving and seasoning. Polyphenol-related researches have been receiving growing attention in the last 20 years, especially the ones concentrating on stilbenoids. In previous studies, resveratrol concentrations have been determined from oilseeds such as peanut. The aim of our research was to define the composition of oilseeds {{with a focus on}} the bioactive compounds, more specifically the resveratrol. Research took place in 2010 – 2011 at the University of Pécs, Medical School, using non-random, convenience sampling. Oilseeds studied in the research were: sunflower seed, roasted peanut, un-roasted peanut, sesame seed, pumpkin seed, almond, linseed, bio white mustard seed, bio black mustard seed, mustard seed of foreign provenance, and <b>wild</b> black <b>mustard</b> seed. All of these oilseeds can be purchased from trade. Samples used in the research were obtained from the producers and collectors. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used for the measurements. Summarising our results, it can be stated that each type of oilseed analysed in our research can be regarded as good sources of resveratrol. The highest level of resveratrol was detected in the sunflower seeds (0. 00398 ± 0. 0001 mg g − 1), almonds (0. 00176 ± 0. 00021 mg g − 1), roasted peanut (0. 00206 ± 0. 00013 mg g − 1), and <b>wild</b> black <b>mustard</b> seeds (0. 0023 ± 0. 0007 mg g − 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{adaptive}} mechanisms {{that allow them}} to tolerate a continuous range of abiotic and biotic stressors. Tropospheric ozone (O 3), a global anthropogenic pollutant, directly affects living organisms and ecosystems, including plant-herbivore interactions. In this study, we investigate the stress responses of Brassica nigra (<b>wild</b> black <b>mustard)</b> exposed consecutively to O 3 and the specialist herbivore Pieris brassicae Transcriptomics and metabolomics data were evaluated using multivariate, correlation, and network analyses for the O 3 and herbivory responses. O 3 stress symptoms resembled those of senescence and phosphate starvation, while a sequential shift from O 3 to herbivory induced characteristic plant defense responses, including a decrease in central metabolism, induction of the jasmonic acid/ethylene pathways, and emission of volatiles. Omics network and pathway analyses predicted a link between glycerol and central energy metabolism that influences the osmotic stress response and stomatal closure. Further physiological measurements confirmed that while O 3 stress inhibited photosynthesis and carbon assimilation, sequential herbivory counteracted the initial responses induced by O 3, resulting in a phenotype similar to that observed after herbivory alone. This study clarifies the consequences of multiple stress interactions on a plant metabolic system and also illustrates how omics data can be integrated to generate new hypotheses in ecology and plant physiology...|$|R

40|$|Plants show {{phenotypic}} changes when challenged with herbivorous insects. The mechanisms underlying {{these changes}} include the activation of transcriptional responses, which {{are dependent on}} the attacking insect. Most transcriptomic studies on crucifer–insect interactions {{have focused on the}} model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a species that faces low herbivore pressure in nature. Here, we study the transcriptional responses of plants from a <b>wild</b> black <b>mustard</b> (Brassica nigra) population to herbivores of different feeding guilds using an A. thaliana-based whole-genome microarray that has previously been shown to be suitable for transcriptomic analyses in Brassica. Transcriptional responses of B. nigra after infestation with either Pieris rapae caterpillars or Brevicoryne brassicae aphids are analyzed and compared. Additionally, the insect-induced expression changes of some individual genes are analyzed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results show that feeding by both insect species results in the accumulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species, defensive proteins and glucosinolates and this is correlated with experimental evidence in the literature on such biochemical effects. Although genes encoding proteins involved in similar processes are regulated by both insects, there was little overlap in the induction or repression of individual genes. Furthermore, P. rapae and B. brassicae seem to affect different phytohormone signaling pathways. In conclusion, our results indicate that B. nigra activates several defense-related genes in response to P. rapae or B. brassicae feeding, but that the response is dependent on the attacking insect species...|$|R
60|$|She {{reached the}} ridge of the cottonwoods and sycamores, {{and a few}} hundred yards further brought her to the edge of that gentle {{southern}} slope which at last sank into the broad meadow of the debatable ground. In spite of Stacey's invidious criticism of its intrinsic value, this theatre of savage dissension, violence, and bloodshed was by some irony of nature a pastoral landscape of singular and peaceful repose. The soft glacis stretching before her was in spring cerulean with lupins, and later starred with mariposas. The meadow was transversely crossed by a curving line of alders that indicated a rare water-course, of which in the dry season only a single pool remained to flash back the unvarying sky. There had been no attempt at cultivation of this broad expanse; <b>wild</b> oats, <b>mustard,</b> and rank grasses left it a tossing sea of turbulent and variegated color whose waves rode high enough to engulf horse and rider in their choking depths. Even the traces of human struggle, the uprooted stakes, scattered fence-rails, and empty post-holes were forever hidden under these billows of verdure. Midway of the field and near the water-course arose McKinstry's barn--the solitary human structure whose rude, misshapen, bulging sides and swallow-haunted eaves bursting with hay from the neighboring pasture, seemed however only an extravagant growth of the prolific soil. Mrs. McKinstry gazed at it anxiously. There was no sign of life or movement near or around it; it stood as it had always stood, deserted and solitary. But turning her eyes to the right, beyond the water-course, she could see a slight regular undulation of the grassy sea and {{what appeared to be the}} drifting on its surface of half a dozen slouched hats in the direction of the alders. There was no longer any doubt; a party from the other side was approaching the border.|$|R
