5|$|As the Laws were {{formulated}} in England, and were initially administered solely {{by the four}} British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.|$|E

50|$|Kleptomania is {{frequently}} {{thought of as}} {{being a part of}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), since the irresistible and uncontrollable actions are similar to the frequently excessive, unnecessary, and unwanted rituals of OCD. Some individuals with kleptomania demonstrate hoarding symptoms that resemble those with OCD.Prevalence rates between the two disorders do not demonstrate a strong relationship. Studies examining the comorbidity of OCD in subjects with kleptomania have inconsistent results, <b>with</b> some showing <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high co-occurrence (45%-60%) while others demonstrate low rates (0%-6.5%). Similarly, when rates of kleptomania have been examined in subjects <b>with</b> OCD, <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> low co-occurrence was found (2.2%-5.9%).|$|R
5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a {{survival}} horror video game developed by Headfirst Productions {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks with 2K Games and Ubisoft for the PC and Xbox systems. The game was published for the Xbox in 2005 and the PC in 2006. Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth combines an action-adventure game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> realistic first-person shooter and elements of a stealth game.|$|E

Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style serif letter design, letters <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with a slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E

5|$|Housing {{the main}} {{armament}} in triple turrets {{was new to}} the Royal Navy though British companies {{had been involved in}} the production of triple gun turret designs for other navies. The choice of a high muzzle velocity <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> lighter shell was taken from the German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the BL 15-inch Mark I gun of 42-calibre length which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} disk {{responsible}} for these phase changes was formed in 1972. What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's long-term polarimetric observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed, providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of the disk axis. Because Pleione has a stellar companion <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> close orbit, the shift in the polarization angle {{has been attributed to}} the companion causing a precession (wobble) of the disk, with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E

5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea {{to be viewed as}} a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5|$|Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high {{melting point}} and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is {{paramagnetic}} at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, {{but there is no}} evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes cancer.|$|E
5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In {{the late}} Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, {{and only one}} in eight qualified barristers {{was able to make}} a living from the law. While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> substantial income {{on the basis of his}} costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E

5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E
5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian horse has {{a rather}} short, high-set {{head with a}} broad forehead. The neck is arched and graceful, and the chest, back and loins broad and {{strongly}} muscled. The shoulders and croup are sloping, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> high-set tail. Overall, the breed gives the impression of strength and agility. Their heavy and wavy mane and tail, arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry. Their trot is described as flashy. They are hardy horses and easy keepers. Today, most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses, and {{are known for their}} jumping ability. They are seen in competition in almost every discipline, as well as for leisure riding. They can also be found in light draft work, trail riding, and working as a stock horse.|$|E
