5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who had few other employment options or they <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was unlawful for black men {{to serve in the}} Navy, but the shortage of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E

5|$|The {{writers of}} Saturday Night Live clashed with Henson's {{vision for the}} program. Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches.

Frank Oz eventually agreed the partnership between Henson's team and the show's writers was imperfect, and was thankful they moved on to The Muppet Show.|$|E

They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were to become President. Obama was elected President in November.

5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes.

The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P.

He added that he deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E

About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned back this attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH.

The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad.|$|E

He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall.

As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E
