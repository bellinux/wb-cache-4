500|$|Despite {{some heavy}} {{promotion}} the black comedy approach {{was not what}} audiences wanted to see, especially with Paul Lynde. As a result, the ratings for the series fell well below the levels of the previous season. The last of The New Temperatures Rising Shows thirteen episodes aired on January 8, 1974. The following Tuesday, January 15, ABC premiered Happy Days in its place. According to co-producer Mitchell, [...] "...the audience didn't buy that at all. They just didn't get it. It was funny if you like black comedy, but if you don't it would disturb you. So the show failed miserably and <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> job and the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Celtic's attacking style {{play against}} Internazionale's catenaccio was heralded as a win for football. Internazionale manager Helenio Herrera said that [...] "We {{can have no}} complaints. Celtic {{deserved}} their victory. We were beaten by Celtic's force. Although <b>we</b> <b>lost,</b> <b>the</b> match was a victory for sport." [...] while one Portuguese official said [...] "This attacking play, {{this is the real}} meaning of football. This is the true game.". The Portuguese newspaper, Mundo Desportivo, said [...] "It was inevitable. Sooner or later the Inter of Herrera, the Inter of catenaccio, of negative football, of marginal victories, had to pay for their refusal to play entertaining football." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Patrick Duffy {{announced}} his intentions {{to leave the}} show which left Pamela and Bobby permanently disconnected from each other. When Duffy initially left Dallas in 1985, {{it was assumed that}} Pamela and Bobby's relationship had finally ended after a brief reconciliation during that season. However, the actor returned to the show the following season after the ratings began to fall. Leonard Katzman said, [...] "Without Bobby <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> white knight to J.R. and the Romeo to Victoria Principal's Juliet. With Patrick back we can return to the family drama that made the show." [...] The entire previous season was written off as a dream, with Pamela waking up and finding Bobby alive in the shower.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{incendiary}} exchange between Roosevelt and MacArthur occurred over an administration proposal to cut 51% of the Army's budget. [...] In response, MacArthur lectured Roosevelt that [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> next war, and an American boy, {{lying in the}} mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, spat out his last curse, I wanted the name not to be MacArthur, but Roosevelt." [...] In response, Roosevelt yelled [...] "you must not talk that way to the President!" [...] MacArthur offered to resign, but Roosevelt refused his request, and MacArthur then staggered out of the White House and vomited on the front steps.|$|E
500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|Goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme retired at age 39. Arriving in 1994, he made nearly 200 {{appearances}} {{over five}} seasons {{and became a}} fan favourite. Benfica hired two replacements: Argentine Carlos Bossio and German Robert Enke. Heynckes described Bossio as the [...] "more experienced" [...] goalkeeper, with [...] "a great talent", but also defining Enke as a [...] "good, young goalkeeper; a promise". The Argentine had appearances on his national team {{and was the first}} choice at Estudiantes, while the German had its breakthrough at Borussia Mönchengladbach only a few months earlier. However, in a pre-season game against Bayern Munich Bossio conceded two goals: [...] "I am calm, although <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> game and my performance led to some 'scolding'." [...] Enke confidently stepped into the position: [...] "If I do not make mistakes, there will be no reason to change goalkeepers." ...|$|E

Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a GI Mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, [...] "I guess <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> kiddie market." [...] In the meantime, Kubrick dropped A.I. {{to work on a}} film adaptation of Wartime Lies, feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the David character. However, after the release of Spielberg's Jurassic Park (with its innovative use of computer-generated imagery), it was announced in November 1993 that production would begin in 1994. Dennis Muren and Ned Gorman, who worked on Jurassic Park, became visual effects supervisors, but Kubrick was displeased with their previsualization, and with the expense of hiring Industrial Light & Magic.|$|E
500|$|Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave {{presented}} Cambridge {{with the}} Beefeater Trophy and both crews with their medals. [...] Oxford's coach Mijnders said [...] "After the big bend, Cambridge were actually flying ... the further the race went on, the better Cambridge rowed". Cambridge coach Williams noted [...] "Some of our boys took some {{stick in the}} press, but they responded to the pressure and were brilliant." [...] Oxford's stroke and Olympic bronze medallist Tim Foster told his crew [...] "We'll always remember <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> Boat Race, but don't forget we are still good rowers." [...] Cadoux-Hudson stated {{in an interview that}} there were two occasions where the blades clashed: [...] "Cambridge were being warned on one occasion and Oxford on the other, so I think it equalled out at the end.

500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{revealed}} {{before the}} Charity Shield game {{that he was}} not overly concerned with Anelka leaving, rather the injuries that were depleting his squad: [...] "I cannot forget that it was because of a poor start to last season that <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> championship to Manchester United." [...] He refused to categorise the match as a [...] "friendly" [...] much like it is traditionally viewed as: [...] "There is a trophy and medals at stake. We won it last season and our players want to win it again." [...] Ferguson described the 3–0 defeat in the previous season's Shield as a [...] "humiliation", before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead: [...] "I have reminded the players {{how hard it is to}} lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy." [...] Indeed, United only lost five matches of the whole of last season, with their last defeat coming at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998.|$|E

500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> World Series, because it means that I still have a friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E

In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Sheeran for their second studio album. In June 2012, Sheeran disclosed that One Direction would be recording two of his songs. In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit {{in an interview with}} British radio network Capital FM: [...] "The great thing about it is I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I do remember that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'. It's got one of my favourite lines that I've ever written in a song." [...] On 15 October 2012, Louis Tomlinson confirmed via social networking website Twitter that [...] "Little Things" [...] would serve as the second single of their second studio album Take Me Home.|$|E
500|$|She {{has played}} with Robyn Maher, Michelle Timms and Shelley Gorman. [...] Jackson admires them. [...] They all won bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Jackson had a rivalry with American {{basketball}} player Lisa Leslie. [...] Both women dislike each other, a dislike {{that goes back}} to when Jackson was on tour in the United States with the Opals as a 16-year-old. The rivalry intensified in 2000 at the Olympics in the gold medal match when Jackson accidentally pulled off Leslie's hair extension when Jackson was trying to grab a rebound. [...] Jackson treated the incident as a joke, saying [...] "It was something to joke about even though <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> gold medal." [...] Leslie did not {{feel the same way about}} the extension pulling incident. [...] The rivalry continued when Jackson transitioned to the WNBA and her Seattle Storm team played Leslie's Los Angeles Sparks, who at the time were the best team in the league. [...] The rivalry was so intense that their coaches had to coach around it, sometimes choosing to keep one off the floor when the other was on. [...] The coaches feared if they left the players on the floor together, their own player would foul out in an attempt to get the best of the other player. [...] Leslie and Jackson have played together as team members in the WNBA's All-Star game. [...] Their relationship thawed some by 2007 but they did not become friends.|$|E

2500|$|It's {{not really}} revenge, I think, if anything, it's redemption. But it's more about us, it's {{not so much}} about Tennessee. We didn't play very well last year when we went there and {{probably}} got caught a little too much focusing on them and the environment and that type of thing. So at practice this year, we're really just focusing on ourselves if we go out and play to our potential then we'll have a chance to be successful. Last year we didn't come close to our potential so we had no chance. Of course it's a big game like it was last year, two ranked teams, so there's a lot of people watching it to see what's going on.
