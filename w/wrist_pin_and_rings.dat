5000|$|As <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> pistons rely for {{lubrication}} {{and cooling}} respectively, {{on the oil}} being splashed around in the crankcase, these parts might have inadequate oiling if too much oil is pulled away by the pump. Installing piston oilers can circumvent this issue, but do so with additional cost and complexity for the engine.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} the dynamics of a piston in a reciprocating engine was conducted. The equation of Reynolds and moving of piston are derived. The analysis, which incorporates a hydrodynamic lubrication model, was applied to M 501 diesel engine. The results {{of this study indicate that}} piston dynamics were found to be sensitive to piston-cylinder bore clearance, location of the <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> lubricant viscosity, underscoring their importance in engine design...|$|R
50|$|The {{unique design}} of this bikes piston makes {{cylinder}} maintenance difficult, as aftermarket companies (as of 2016) do not manufacture replacements and new old stock (NOS) parts are not widely available. Due to this, {{it is common}} practice to install the nearly identical 88-04 pistons in these bikes, which share both <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> piston diameter measurements. Doing so will lower the compression ratio, but still function. Cylinders from later bikes are not compatible.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{graduation}} theses is geometrical and {{thermodynamic calculation}} of determined five-cylinder diesel engine and calculation of operation parameters of cylindrical unit and then to compare them with real motor and strike the balance. Other step {{is to work out}} thermodynamic cycle and draw the result in p-V diagram. Then to calculate power, effecting on piston which includes proposal of basic proportion of piston <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> <b>and</b> it follows weigh of piston group and maximal quickening and inertial force of piston group, calculation of specific pressure <b>and</b> pressure in <b>wrist</b> <b>pin.</b> Other purpose is to determine basic proportion for piston rod and to focus on material qualities of con rod eye and bronze case, determination of maximal pressure due to inertial forces comming from gas pressure and security against possible slip and tiredness. At the beginning is described diesel engine from its foundation, its activity to its use in company. At the close are reviewed the results of the calculations...|$|R
50|$|Under ideal {{engineering}} conditions, {{force is}} applied directly {{in the line of}} travel of the assembly. The sinusoidal motion, cosinusoidal velocity, and sinusoidal acceleration (assuming constant angular velocity) result in smoother operation. The higher percentage of time spent at top dead centre (dwell) improves theoretical engine efficiency of constant volume combustion cycles. It allows the elimination of joints typically served by a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> <b>and</b> near elimination of piston skirts and cylinder scuffing, as side loading of piston due to sine of connecting rod angle is mitigated. The longer the distance between the piston and the yoke, the less wear that occurs, but greater the inertia, making such increases in the piston rod length realistically only suitable for lower RPM (but higher torque) applications.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} the plasma nitrided AISI 316 LN type austenitic stainless steel specimens (both <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>rings)</b> have been analyzed. The experiments have been conducted in high vacuum and in air atmosphere using Vacuum based high temperature Pin-on-disc tribometer. The tribological parameters such as friction coefficient and wear resistance have been analyzed by Origin graphs. The wear mechanisms involved have been identified by recording surface morphology on the wear track <b>and</b> <b>pin</b> surface through scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Optical profilometer. The self mating of AISI 316 LN type stainless steel (316 LN) exhibits strong adhesion between the contact surfaces and severe surface damage both in air and in vacuum atmosphere. But, the self mating of Plasma Nitrided 316 LN (CrN/CrN) reveals mild wear till the CrN coating peeled off from the pin surface.

40|$|There is a {{research}} knowledge gap for the dry wear data of nitride treated Stainless Steel in high temperature and high vacuum environment. In order to fill this gap, plasma nitriding was done on austenitic Stainless Steel type AISI 316 LN (316 LN SS) and dry sliding wear tests have been conducted at 25 degrees C, 200 degrees C and 400 degrees C in high vacuum of 1. 6 x 10 (- 4) bar. The two different slider material (316 LN SS and Colmonoy) and two different sliding speeds (0. 0576 m/s and 0. 167 m/s) have been used. The tribological parameters such as friction coefficient, wear mechanism and volume of metal loss have been evaluated. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to study the surface morphology of the worn <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>rings.</b> Electronic balancing machine was used to record the mass of metal loss during wear tests. The 2 D optical profilometer {{was used to measure}} the depth of the wear track. The Plasma Nitride treated 316 LN SS rings (PN rings) exhibit excellent wear resistance against 316 LN SS <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> Colmonoy <b>pin</b> at all temperatures. However, PN ring vs. Colmonoy pin Pair shows better wear resistance than PN ring vs. 316 LN SS pin Pair at higher temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abrasives {{are used}} in various forms to produce fine {{finishes}} on metal surfaces. Previously, grinding and abrasive processes have been studied in isolation; the present work however has shown that grinding can be usefully interpreted in abrasive wear terms. Wear experiments using small grinding wheels on a <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> machine {{have been able to}} reproduce many of the effects observed not only in grinding but also in such specialised processes as super-finishing. Abrasive wear theory has been re-examined, especially the parameters making up the K factor, and then applied to the grinding process. In order to test theoretical predictions a grinding dynamomoter was constructed to measure forces in surface grinding. Idealised indentors having simple geometrical shapes, similar to those assumed in abrasive wear theory, were tracked across smooth metal surfaces. Measurements of the seratches produced were then compared with theory. Scratch tests on a range of heat-treated steels using both idealised indentors and abrasive grits showed that pile-up at the edge of scratches is a highly significant factor in determining wear rate in abrasion and cutting forces in grinding. Finally a wide range of techniques for examining abrasives has been studied, the most notable of which involved the use of a scanning electron microscope...|$|R

40|$|Compressors {{are being}} {{required}} to operate at increasingly severe conditions {{in order to increase}} efficiency, and with the transition from CFC to HFC and natural refrigerants, natural ferrous chloride layers on iron surfaces have been eliminated. To recover lost wear resistance with the transition to oil-less operation, greater protection is sought through the application of hard coatings with enhanced tribological properties. Controlled shoe-on-disk experiments simulating the interface in a swashplate compressor were performed using a High Pressure Tribometer under unlubricated conditions. Specimens used for these experiments included 52100 steel shoes and coated aluminum A 390 -T 6 disks. Coatings were provided by two leading manufacturers and consisted of two different single layer WC/C coatings (one from each manufacturer), multi-layer WC/C + DLC and multi-layer TiAlN + WC/C. To help increase load bearing ability on the relatively soft aluminum, a CrN underlayer was deposited on half of the disks. The performance of the coatings was evaluated using surface profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. In some cases, the CrN underlayer increased friction due to increased roughness, while it also significantly increased the load bearing capability in most applications. One of the CrN + WC/C multilayered coatings exhibited friction coefficients similar to lubricated experiments with scuffing loads roughly ten times larger than uncoated, unlubricated tests. Controlled, reciprocating pin-on-disk experiments imitating the wrist pin-connecting rod interface were also performed under unlubricated conditions. Specimens used for these experiments included coated, cylindrical 52100 steel <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> uncoated cast iron disks. Coatings used were the same as those for the swashplate simulation tests but without the CrN underlayer. Analysis of experiments investigating temperature effects, frequency variation, and performance in various refrigerants including R 134 a, R 410 a, and R 600 a, was completed using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis, and surface profilometry. It was found that steady-state friction coefficients decreased with increasing temperature while friction coefficients increased during the running-in period. Also, wear decreased from testing in room temperature up to 80 ??C and beyond that, increased due to unstable running-in. Tests conducted in R 410 a produced the lowest wear, while those in R 600 a had the lowest friction coefficients. Tests in R 134 a performed the worst, but better than tests conducted in dry nitrogen. Based on the research presented in this work, hard coatings have the potential to replace oil in future compressors. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 17...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{microwell}} chip {{is developed}} {{that can be}} used to detect protein binding in a liquid environment, together with a liquid handling system that allows the performance of assays with picoliter volumes. A PDMS well structure is cast on a planar optical waveguide, providing reaction containers combined with a high-sensitivity fluorescence readout system. Individual wells of the array can be addressed, filled, and rinsed using a contact-mode <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> spotter. This allows for immunoassays in a heavily multiplexed way, as all steps of the assay can be individually chosen per well. An array density of over 1000 wells cm(- 2) is used for the current experiments. The wells provide a protected liquid environment in which the handling of proteins in their natural state is possible, thus maintaining their activity. The membrane protein annexin V is chosen as a model protein to demonstrate the current possibilities. Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine (PS) head groups of lipids in a Ca(2 +) -dependent manner and is often chosen as a marker for cell apoptosis. Lipid vesicles with and without PS are spotted in individual wells and spontaneously formed a planar lipid bilayer on the bottom of the buffer-filled wells. Annexin V can be used to distinguish between wells containing PS groups previously incorporated in the membrane patches and reference wells without PS head groups. Also, the dependence on the calcium concentration can be shown. Fluorescence readout of the assays is performed using a highly sensitive system based on a planar optical waveguide...|$|R

Technical errors may result in damage at the anastomosis due to an inadequate eversion of the vessel walls, the introduction of unequal bite distances or endothelial injury at the suture sites, causing increased thrombotic potential. Since the introduction of microvascular free-tissue transfer, surgical technique modifications and new devices have become highly sought after as a means for improving overall outcome. Vessel couplers are one such device, with <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> coupling <b>rings</b> providing an alternative to traditional hand-sewn anastomoses.
