5|$|Dodd {{wanted the}} SEC {{to limit the}} amount of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to be taken by the presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd made it clear that Tech would leave the SEC unless the rule was changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6-6. Tech's president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Butler {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} computer tomography scans {{of the juvenile}} skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, replacement teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth replacement must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals – this morphology <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|E
5|$|One of history's great Chiefs of Staff {{and a key}} {{member of}} the Imperial Staff, Schmitt was the most {{experienced}} Austrian leader, called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the Austro-Russian retreat. He had wide experience as a leader: From the summer of 1796 {{until his retirement in}} 1800, he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, of the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany, and a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. Consequently, he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans under different terrain. The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt, an experienced officer and sound tactician, would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz, at least more effective than his replacement, Franz von Weyrother, as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. After Schmitt's death, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz. In the long run, it was unlikely that Schmitt's plan <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> the overall outcome—Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest battles—but his battle plan would no doubt have been an improvement over the one the Allies used.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the terminal was opposed by {{the residents of the}} Turtle Bay neighborhood, where it was planned to be located in, as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> the character of their neighborhood. Turtle Bay residents wanted the terminal moved to Grand Central. They also disliked the proposed traffic congestion the new terminal would bring. The MTA contended that its studies had shown that Third Avenue was the only feasible place to put the terminal, and there would have been too great of a concentration of rail lines at Grand Central. It concluded that having the LIRR going to Grand Central would further strain the Lexington Avenue Line. If it were on Third Avenue, passengers would have been more inclined to use the Second Avenue Subway, which was partially under construction at the time. On April 16, 1973, a Federal directive directed New York State to consider expanding and modernizing Grand Central before building the new terminal under Third Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Physiological {{noise is}} from head and brain {{movement}} in the scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting, tensing, or making physical responses such as button presses. Head movements cause the voxel-to-neurons mapping to change while scanning is in progress. Since fMRI is acquired in slices, after movement, a voxel continues {{to refer to the}} same absolute location in space while the neurons underneath it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed.</b> Another source of physiological noise is the change in the rate of blood flow, blood volume, and use of oxygen over time. This last component contributes to two-thirds of physiological noise, which, in turn, is the main contributor to total noise.|$|E
25|$|Rapfogel and Silver {{were accused}} of {{promoting}} specific plans for favored developers, which would maintain the area's Jewish identity, {{at the expense of}} other communities. They opposed a 1970s plan for affordable housing, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> the demographics of the neighborhood and brought in more Chinese and Hispanic residents. Silver instead proposed a shopping center with no housing for the site in the 1980s. In the 1990s, they proposed a “big box” store, like Costco, to be built by Bruce Ratner, a developer. Ratner hired Rapfogel's eldest son in 2007, and Silver employed Rapfogel's wife as his chief of staff. Ratner also helped raise $1 million for the Met Council.|$|E

25|$|The decimalisation {{movement}} even entered fiction. In Anthony Trollope's Palliser novels (and {{more so in}} {{the television}} series based on them), Plantagenet Palliser is a passionate advocate of decimalisation, a cause the other characters seem to find intensely boring. Palliser's scheme would have divided the shilling into ten (presumably revalued) pennies. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> the threepence into 2.5 new pence, the sixpence into fivepence and the half crown into a two shilling, five pence piece. It would also have required the withdrawal and reissuance of the existing copper coinage. At {{the end of the}} fifth book in the series, The Prime Minister, Palliser (now Duke of Omnium) muses that the reform will not be accomplished, since it can only be done by a Chancellor of the Exchequer sitting in the House of Commons, and the Duke now sits in the House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|The Canal Street Portal (also Haymarket Portal, North Station Portal or Causeway Street Portal, often {{referred}} to in revenue service as the Canal Street Loop) {{was part of the}} transition between subway and elevated railway on the Green Line, as it transitioned from the Tremont Street Subway to the Causeway Street Elevated towards the Lechmere Viaduct until 2004, when the Green Line north of North Station was closed for building of a new tunnel and portal. Certain trains turned at Canal Street, while others emerged from the subway to a viaduct to Lechmere. It was, however, possible for a passenger to alight from a train at Canal Street and proceed up a series of stairways to the Lechmere Viaduct. However, most passengers desiring to continue to Science Park or Lechmere <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> to a Lechmere signed car from a North Station signed car prior to the emergence from the central subway.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare {{wrote the}} role of Lear for his company's chief tragedian, Richard Burbage, for whom Shakespeare was writing {{incrementally}} older characters as their careers progressed. It has been speculated either that {{the role of}} the Fool was written for the company's clown Robert Armin, or that it was written for performance by one of the company's boys, doubling the role of Cordelia. Only one specific performance of the play during Shakespeare's lifetime is known: before the court of King James I at Whitehall on 26 December 1606. Its original performances would have been at The Globe, where there were no sets in the modern sense, and characters would have signified their roles visually with props and costumes: Lear's costume, for example, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> {{in the course of the}} play as his status diminished: commencing in crown and regalia; then as a huntsman; raging bareheaded in the storm scene; and finally crowned with flowers in parody of his original status.|$|E
