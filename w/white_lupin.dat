50|$|According to Kurlovich's data, {{the center}} of {{formation}} of wild <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus albus L.) and the primary center of origin (diversity) of its initial cultivated forms is the Balkans where an exceptionally wide diversity of wild and local forms {{as well as those}} that turned wild is concentrated. All three subspecies of <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> (subsp. graecus Franko et Silva, subsp. termis Ponert., subsp. albus) occur on the Balkans, and it is mainly in this region that wild forms with dotted dark-brown seeds and dark-blue flowers are found (subsp. graecus). Additional confirmation is the Greek name of white lupin: “thermos” (hot). The centers of diversity of cultivated <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> also include the Apennines and Egypt where cultivated forms of <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> originated in the ancient times. Moreover, in the ancient Egypt forms with pink-and-blue or light-pink flowers were spread (subsp. termis), and on the Apennines forms with grayish-and-light-blue or white flowers were distributed (subsp. albus.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the feeding value of <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) and triticale for Nicholas Large White turkeys using a corn-soybean meal type diet as a control. Diets were formulated to have equal amounts of specified nutrients per unit of meta-bolizable energy. Growth of male turkeys 0 to 3 weeks of age {{was similar to the}} control group when 15 % <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> were included in the diet. When <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> were included at 30, 45, or 60 % of the diet, growth was significantly depressed to 94, 89, or 85 % of control, respectively. When triticale replaced corn there was a 6 % increase in growth, which was nearly significant. Growth of female turkeys 8 to 12 weeks of age fed diets where <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> supplied 20 % of supplemental (soybean) protein was similar to turkeys fed control diets. When <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> pro-vided 30, 40, or 100 % of supplemental protein, gains were 94, 95, or 85 % of control, respectively (significant depressions). True metabolizable energy values for <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> and triticale were 2641 and 3306 kcal/kg, respectively. Amino acid profiles for <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> and triticale are given.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{influence}} of extrusion on the composition and nutritive value of <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus L.) was evaluated. The extrudate was produced by the extrusion cooking of <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> at 22 % moisture level and 140 °C. Three treatment diets consisting of a corn-soy basal diet and two test diets containing raw and extruded lupin meals were formulated and, assayed in digestibility and balance trials using 4 -week old broiler chickens. The test diets were formulated by substituting the raw and extruded lupin meals for 25 % (w/w) of the basal diet. Apparent ileal nutrient digestibility was calculated using titanium oxide as the indigestible indicator and the Apparent Metabolizable Energy (AME) was determined using the classical total excreta collection method. Extrusion of <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> had no effect (p 0. 05) on the ileal digestibility of protein and amino acids. Overall, under the extrusion conditions employed in the present study, extrusion cooking adversely affected the AME but {{had no effect on}} the ileal digestibility of protein and amino acids in <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> for broilers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the inclusion of faba beans (Vicia faba), <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) and peas (Pisum sativum) in two different basal diets on the performance, digestive tract development and carcass characteristics of broilers housed in floor pens over a 35 d grow-out period. The experimental design was a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement of treatments which evaluated two basal wheat-soy diets (with or without meat meal) and legume grains (no legume grain, or faba beans, <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> and peas at 200 g/kg inclusion). All diets were formulated to contain similar levels of metabolizable energy and digestible amino acids. A 3 -phase feeding programme (starter, grower and finisher) was employed. The starter, grower and finisher diets were offered from day 1 - 7, 8 - 21 and 22 - 35, respectively. During the starter period, legume x meat meal interaction was significant (p 0. 05) on the performance and carcass recovery of broilers and the litter score. Weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were better (p< 0. 05) than those with meat meal. The main effect of legumes was significant (p< 0. 01 to 0. 05) for the relative weight of liver and gizzard and the relative digesta weight of the crop and proventriculus. Birds fed meat meal diets had lower (p< 0. 05) relative weights of liver, pancreas and small intestine and relative digesta weight of small intestine than those fed diets with no meat meal diets. It was concluded that, when balanced for metabolizable energy and digestible amino acids, dietary inclusion of faba beans, <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> and peas at 200 g/kg either in wheat-soybean meal or wheat-soybean meal-meat meal basal diets could support a good performance of birds over the 35 -day grow-out period...|$|R

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of faba beans (Vicia faba), Australian sweet <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus angustifolius), <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) and peas (Pisum sativum) grown in New Zealand for broilers were evaluated {{in terms of}} their nutritional characteristics, protein quality (protein efficiency ratio), apparent metabolisable energy, apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids and the effects on bird performance. The effects of dehulling and extrusion cooking on the nutritive value of legumes were also investigated. The first experiment discussed in Chapter 3 evaluated the effect of cultivars on the nutrient profile and protein quality of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), Australian sweet lupins, peas and soybeans (Glycine max). With the exception of <b>white</b> <b>lupins,</b> cultivars had no effect on the proximate and fibre composition of grain legumes. Starch was the primary carbohydrate component of chickpeas and peas, whilst non-starch polysaccharides were the major carbohydrates in lupins. The legume proteins were deficient in lysine, methionine, cystine and threonine. No differences were found in protein quality between cultivars of the different grain legume species. The lowest weight gain and protein efficiency ratio, in addition to the highest relative pancreatic weight and mortality rate was found in raw soybeans, suggesting that soybeans contained high a concentration of anti-nutritional factors, such as protease inhibitors. Birds fed chickpeas, lupins and peas had a low mortality rate and relative pancreatic weight, confirming that the level of anti-nutrients in these legume seeds was low. The apparent metabolisable energy and apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of faba beans, Australian sweet <b>lupins,</b> <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> and peas were determined in the second experiment (Chapter 4). Cultivar effect on the apparent metabolisable energy values was observed only for faba beans and <b>white</b> <b>lupins.</b> Faba beans, <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> and peas had comparable apparent metabolisable energy values, but these values were higher than those of Australian sweet lupins, and lower than that of soybean meal. No cultivar differences were found in the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of grain legumes. The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of both lupin species was found to be comparable to that of soybean meal. The effects of feeding diets containing 200 g/kg faba beans, lupins or peas on the performance, digestive tract development and litter quality of broilers were investigated in the third and fourth trials. In the cage trial (Chapter 5), the results showed that the weight gain of birds fed diets containing grain legumes was similar to that of control diet. Feed intake and feed per gain of birds fed diets containing the majority of grain legume cultivars did not differ from those fed the maize-soy diet. Birds fed diets containing faba beans had more dry and friable excreta compared to other treatment diets. The performance of birds fed diets containing 200 g/kg grain legumes during the 35 d grow-out period, in the floor pen trial (Chapter 6), confirmed the results of the cage trial. In this trial, weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were superior to those with meat meal. In cage trials, the modification of some segments of digestive tract development was probably due to the dietary NSP. Whilst in floor pen trial, digestive tract development was not influenced by the inclusion of grain legumes. The effect of methodology of determination (direct vs. difference method) on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of wheat, maize, Australian sweet lupins, peas and soybean meal for broilers was evaluated in the fifth study (Chapter 7). The influence of methodology on apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids was found to vary amongst the feed ingredients. In general, the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of test ingredients determined by the difference method was higher than those determined by the direct method, suggesting that the use of the direct method may underestimate the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids in low and medium protein ingredients. Data reported in Chapter 8 shows that dehulling increased the apparent metabolisable energy values of faba beans and Australian sweet lupins, but it had no beneficial effect on peas. The increase of apparent metabolisable energy values may be attributed to the decrease in non-starch polysaccharides of these legume seeds after dehulling. The removal of hulls increased the amino acid concentrations, but it had no effect on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of most amino acids. These results suggest that dehulling of grain legumes would be nutritionally beneficial and, likely to be economical in view of the improved amino acid concentrations and energy values. The final experiment (Chapter 9) demonstrated that extrusion of peas markedly influenced the content of crude protein, non-starch polysaccharides, starch, and trypsin inhibitors. The soluble non-starch polysaccharides and trypsin inhibitor contents of the majority of extruded pea samples were higher than those of raw peas, but insoluble and total non-starch polysaccharides decreased with extrusion. Extrusion had no effect on the apparent ileal protein digestibility and the apparent metabolisable energy of peas, but it increased ileal starch digestibility...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> is annual, {{more or less}} {{pubescent}} plant, 30 to 120 cm high, has a {{wide distribution}} in the Mediterranean region. White lupine is widely spread as wild plants throughout the southern Balkans, Puglia, the islands of Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia, and the Aegean Sea, {{as well as in}} Israel, Palestine and western Turkey. Occurs in meadows, pastures, and grassy slopes, predominantly on sandy and acid soils. It is cultivated over all the Mediterranean region and also in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Syria, Central and Western Europe, USA and South America, Tropical and Southern Africa, Russia, and Ukraine. The ancient culture of <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> under the local name [...] "hanchcoly" [...] was practiced until recently in Western Georgia. [...] <b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> is distinct within the vast and polymorphous genus Lupinus L. for small variation of morphological characters.

50|$|The {{beginning}} {{of the history of}} lupin cultivation in the Old World is often associated with the times of the ancient Egyptian civilization (Zhukovsky, 1929). It is, however, more likely (Kurlovich, 2002) that originally <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> was introduced into cultivation in ancient Greece where its greatest biodiversity was concentrated and wild-growing forms have been preserved until nowadays (ssp. graecus). On the Balkan Peninsula representatives of another subspecies of <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> (ssp. termis and ssp. albus) turned wild and grows now in natural environments. Besides, the Grecian genesis of cultivated lupin is testified by lupin’s Greek name termis, that may be translated as “ardent”. Until today, in many countries of the world water-soaked and boiled lupin seeds are sold on markets and in bars as snacks (much like sunflower seeds). <b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> dispersed step-by-step from Greece to adjacent countries, in particular, to Egypt and Ancient Rome. The forms with white seeds and pink-and-blue or light-pink flowers (L. termis) spread mainly towards the south (Egypt, Libya and Palestine), while the forms with white seeds and grayish-blue or white flowers (L. albus) moved to the west (Apennine Peninsula and farther).|$|E

Currently, it is not re-commended for cultivation in Bavaria. In field trials, different varieties of blue lupins proved to be worth cultivating on organically managed sandy loam and loamy sand on three sites in Bavaria. Boregine and Probor were tested for four years, Mirabor and Boruta for one year.

40|$|Dehydrins (DHNs) are {{proteins}} that accumulate abundantly in various plant tissues {{in response to}} environmental stresses and during seed maturation, possibly assisting cells in tolerating dehydration. <b>White</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus L.) are able to withstand periods of severe water deﬁcit (WD) and previous work suggested that the stem plays a central role as a survival structure. To investigate DHNs involvement in this strategy, we studied tissue speciﬁc protein accumulation of a RAB 16 -like DHN in lupin during a progressive WD and early recovery. Differences were found between leaves, stems and roots. In leaves and roots, the accumulation of the RAB 16 -like DHN was independent of the water status whereas in the stem (cortex and stele), DHNs were only detected under severe plant WD (stele relative water content, RWC, reduction of 6 – 7 % and cortex RWC reduction of 20 %).

40|$|Sweet <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) and a {{high protein}} variety of soyabeans, AC Proteus (HPSB), were roasted in an {{electric}} roaster at 300 degrees C for 1, 2, 3 or 4 min. Raw and roasted samples were analysed for total nitrogen, acid detergent insoluble N and protease insoluble N, and available rumen by-pass protein (RBP) was determined. In situ degradability of DM and N was determined using Dacron bags in the rumen of 3 ruminally cannulated dry cows. Soyabean meal {{was used as a}} control treatment. Roasting did not affect the total N content of lupins (4. 9 %) and HPSB (7. 3 %), but increased linearly (P< 0. 02) the protease insoluble N content of both. As roasting time increased the acid detergent insoluble N content of lupins (4. 7, 5. 1, 6. 7 and 7. 9 % at 1, 2, 3 and 4 min roasting, respectively) and HPSB (4. 9, 6. 3, 6. 6 and 7. 2 % at 1, 2, 3 and 4 min roasting, respectively) increased. Available RBP in roasted HPSB increased as roasting time increased (27. 6, 33. 8, 41. 2 and 43. 3 % at 1, 2, 3 and 4 min roasting, respectively); however, roasting time did not affect RBP of roasted lupins (20. 6 %). Soyabean meal had a lower RBP percentage than roasted lupins or HPSB. Roasting reduced (P< 0. 01) effective degradation of DM and N in roasted lupins and HPSB at a calculated outflow rate in the rumen of 0. 06 h/day.

40|$|Background and Aims Dynamic {{processes}} {{occurring at}} the soil-root interface crucially influence soil physical, {{chemical and biological}} properties at a local scale around the roots, and are technically challenging to capture in situ. This study presents a novel multi-imaging approach combining fluorescence and neutron radiography that is able to simultaneously monitor root growth, water content distribution, root respiration and root exudation. Methods Germinated seeds of <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) were planted in boron-free glass rhizotrons. After 11 d, the rhizotrons were wetted from the bottom and time series of fluorescence and neutron images were taken during the subsequent day and night cycles for 13 d. The following day (i. e. 25 d after planting) the rhizotrons were again wetted from the bottom and the measurements were repeated. Fluorescence sensor foils were attached to the inner sides of the glass and measurements of oxygen and pH were {{made on the basis}} of fluorescence intensity. The experimental set-up allowed for simultaneous fluorescence imaging and neutron radiography. Key Results The interrelated patterns of root growth and distribution in the soil, root respiration, exudation and water uptake could all be studied non-destructively and at high temporal and spatial resolution. The older parts of the root system with greater root-length density were associated with fast decreases of water content and rapid changes in oxygen concentration. pH values around the roots located in areas with low soil water content were significantly lower than the rest of the root system. Conclusions The results suggest that the combined imaging set-up developed here, incorporating fluorescence intensity measurements, is able to map important biogeochemical parameters in the soil around living plants with a spatial resolution that is sufficiently high enough to relate the patterns observed to the root syste...|$|R
40|$|Layers diets {{typically}} contain 15 – 20 % soya due to {{its high}} crude protein content (ca. 36 %). Reliance on soya for protein can result in large increases in cost of feed due {{to the law of}} supply and demand as a global commodity. Lupin grains have high protein content (35 – 40 %) but previous experience with <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> has shown toxic effects in poultry due to high levels alkaloids and poor performance due to anti-nutritional Non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). Here blue lupins either processed or whole were trialled for their potential as a protein source. Point of lay chickens (64) at 16 weeks of age were weighed and allocated to 16 coops of four hens. Coops, as the experimental unit, were randomly allocated to four treatments: layers mash with soya (Control); or layers mash with 150  g of lupin/kg diet with the lupin either: whole (Whole); dehulled (Dehulled) or dehulled + a solid state fermentation enzyme extract (SSF; 150  g/tonne DM). All diets were ground and formulated to be balanced for energy, crude protein and essential amino acids using NIRS. No difference in growth rate, final hen weight, DM and water intake, eggs per day, mean egg weight, yellowness of yolk or chroma was found between treatments. There was a trend (P< 0. 1) for the SSF treatment to produce less heavy shells and a significant effect for the lupin treatments to have redder yolks (P< 0. 001). Fecal DM and bacterial counts were not different and {{there was no sign of}} enteritis or intestinal tissue hyperplasia from hen autopsies.

40|$|Nine {{multiparous}} cows {{in early}} lactation were fed alfalfa silage ad libitum twice daily, a grain-based concentrate five times daily, {{and one of}} three protein sources five times daily. Supplemental proteins were soya-bean meal, raw coarse-ground sweet <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> or roasted coarse-ground sweet <b>white</b> <b>lupins.</b> Roasting of lupins increased the calculated undegraded intake protein (UIP) proportion from 7. 2 to 33. 3 % of total nitrogen. Intake of dry matter and organic matter was lower for lupin-supplemented cows, but intake of neutral detergent fibre was similar for all cows. Production of milk, and milk components, was similar among treatments although milk protein concentration was lower, and milk protein yield tended to be lower, for lupin-supplemented cows. Cows on all diets used dietary protein much more efficiently than calculations based upon National Research Council recommendations would suggest. Although lupin oil only comprised 1. 1 - 1. 2 % of dry matter intake, changes in milk composition were typical of those associated with fat feeding as de novo synthesis of C- 10 to C- 16 fatty acids was suppressed, transfer of long-chain fatty acids was increased and protein percentage was decreased in milk from lupin-supplemented cows. Roasting appeared to increase protection of lupin oil from ruminal hydrogenation, as evidenced by increased concentrations of long-chain fatty acids in milk from cows supplemented with roasted lupins. The changes in fat composition are positive for the public perception of a more hypocholesterolemic milk fat, but the decrease in protein percentage is a concern both for the manufacture of milk products and with respect to changes in milk pricing formulae that assign a higher value to milk protein than to milk fat.

30|$|The {{ability to}} use {{phosphorus}} from phosphate rock sources differ from crop to crop mainly because the mobilizing capacity of P from various phosphate rocks varies with crop species (Van Straaten 2002). The best known plants with relatively high P-mobilizing capacities are buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), white sweet clover (Melilotus albus), kale, or rape (Brassica napus), <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus), cabbage (Brassica oleraced), Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan). Legumes are especially suited for the utilization of PRs. They are compelling in dissolving PR and in engrossing its disintegration items in view of their interest for Ca and the acidifying impact of nitrogen (N) fixation in the soil close to the root framework (rhizosphere). This effect can be utilized to improve the P nutrition of a companion crop (intercropping) or that of the subsequent crop in a rotation (Perrott 2001). Some plant species (e.g., rapeseed, lupines, and pigeon pea) have been studied because {{of their ability to}} secrete organic acids that result in an enhanced dissolution of PR (Montenegro and Zapata 2002). Reactive PRs may have potential applications even in alkaline soils with organic acid-secreting crops such as rapeseed (canola). The influence of P source, rate, and frequency on dry matter yield of maize and cowpea grown sequentially in three soil types studied by Akande et al. (2010). Phosphate application significantly enhanced dry matter yields of maize and cowpea. Single superphosphate (SSP) gave a higher total biomass than the phosphate rocks (PR). In the regular application frequency in the first cropping, maize total biomass was increased by single superphosphate from 4.23  g/plant to 8.20, 9.25, and 9.72 with 20, 40, and 60  kg P/ha while it was increased to 6.78, 6.26, and 6.34  g with OPR but to 6.88, 7.60, and 7.15  g with CS. Cowpea yield were increased from 2.12  g/plant to 3.28, 4.04, and 3.36  g with single superphosphate to 3.34, 3.27, and 2.61 with CS and to 2.59, 2.78, and 2.39 g with OPR.|$|R

40|$|Wild white lupins {{have high}} levels of alkaloids, which cause a bitter taste, whereas domesticated <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> {{varieties}} have a very low content of alkaloids in seeds. Genes for bitterness from wild white lupins are a contamination threat to domesticated <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> via cross-pollination. The gene(s) for alkaloid synthesis have not been clearly identified, and the associated molecular background among wild <b>white</b> <b>lupin,</b> domesticated and contaminated domesticated plant materials is unknown.

However, there has been limited research effort to characterize the Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> landraces. Fifteen polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of 212 Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus albus) landraces and two genotypes from different species (Lupinus angustifolius and Lupinus mutabilis) were used as out-group. The SSR markers revealed 108 different alleles, 98 of them from 212 landraces and 10 from out-group genotypes, with an average of 6. 5 alleles per locus. The average gene diversity was 0. 31. Twenty eight landraces harbored one or more private alleles from the total of 28 private alleles identified in the 212 <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> accessions. Seventy-seven rare alleles with a frequency of less than 5 % were identified and accounted for 78. 6 % of the total alleles detected. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 92 % of allelic diversity was attributed to individual accessions within populations while only 8 % was distributed among populations. At 70 % similarity level, the UPGMA dendrogram resulted in the formation of 13 clusters comprised of 2 to 136 landraces, with the out-group genotypes and five landraces remaining distinct and ungrouped. Population differentiation and genetic distance were relatively high between Gondar and Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> populations collected by Australians. A model-based population structure analysis divided the <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> landraces into two populations. All Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> landrace populations, except most of the landraces collected by Australians (77 %) and about 44 % from Awi, were grouped together with significant admixtures. The study also suggested that 34 accessions, as core collections, were sufficient to retain 100 % of SSR diversity.

40|$|A {{procedure}} that mimics washing {{in the in}} situ incubation technique, combined with an in vitro gas and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production technique, was used to verify the assumption that rumen degradation behaviour of material washed out of nylon bags is instantaneous and complete. In a 6 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments with three replicates, fractions of maize, barley, milo, yellow peas, lupins (a mixture of <b>white</b> and spotted <b>lupins)</b> and round-seeded brown faba beans were subjected to an in vitro incubation technique. Fractions were whole (WHO), non-washable (NWF), insoluble washable (ISWF) and soluble washable (SWF). In a manually operated in vitro fermentation system, another 24 samples of the same substrates were fermented for VFA and ammonia analysis. Except in lupins, ISWF in the concentrate ingredients was very rich in starch. SWF was relatively rich in ash, crude protein, soluble sugars, and a residual unknown fraction but contained only a negligible quantity of starch. Thus, the fermentation characteristics of ISWF were more like WHO and NWF than SWF. Total gas production of SWF was considerably lower than the other fractions. A very rapidly degradable fraction {{was seen in the}} first phase of degradation of SWF. The pattern of fermentation end-product formation for SWF differed from that of the other fractions.

40|$|Flavonoids are {{a diverse}} group of plant {{secondary}} metabolites that accumulate in a variety of plant tissues and play many roles in important processes including stress protection, defence and seed dispersal. To accomplish many of these functions, flavonoids accumulate at high concentrations. However, the denaturing properties of these phenolic substances make them toxic to the cytosol. Therefore, flavonoids undergo secretion into the extracellular space or accumulate in the vacuole. The knowledge of transport mechanisms involved in the accumulation of flavonoids is limited, even though the biosynthetic pathway is well known. Recent reports suggest that MATE proteins are involved in flavonoid transport and act as cation H+/Na+-antiporters. However, the identification of conserved amino acid residues or domains essential to a transport function remains poorly characterised, with no reports for plant MATEs. TT 12 is a vacuolar flavonoid/H+-antiporter expressed exclusively in the seed coat endothelium actively involved in the transport of glucosylated anthocyanins (Marinova et al, 2007). In this work we describe strategies to (i) functionally identify important amino acid residues using TT 12 as a model for plant MATE family, (ii) functionally characterise two novel MATE transporters in Lupinus albus implicated in citrate and isoflavonoids transport and (iii) identify novel flavonoid transporters within the 56 members of the Arabidopsis MATE family. (i) Since TT 12 gene was well characterised in our laboratory and due to its easily scorable seed phenotype, we decided to use TT 12 as a model to investigate which amino acids are crucial for proper functioning of plant MATE transporters. Given that transport critical residues for NorM from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and hMATE 1 from Homo sapiens were identified and we found an amino acid residue homologous to them in TT 12 (E 290), we performed site-directed mutagenesis on E 290 and nine others amino acid residues. In the range of experiments we searched specially for the mutated versions of TT 12 which were unable to functionally complement the PA deficient seed phenotype of tt 12 mutant. We describe that only a single amino acid (E 290) failed to complement the tt 12 seed phenotype and further show that this mutated version completely lacks transport activity on cyanidin 3 -glucoside (the substrate for the native TT 12). (ii) <b>White</b> <b>lupins</b> characteristically produce cluster roots under phosphate starvation. These cluster roots are known to excrete both citrate and isoflavonoids into the rhizosphere. Previous work within the group identified two full length cDNAs expressed in cluster roots. These were designated LaMATE 1 and - 2. We investigated if these cDNAs, when heterogously expressed in yeast, were able to transport either citrate or the isoflavonoid, genistein. We describe that LaMATE 1 was unable to transport citrate but LaMATE 2 transported genistein, when uptake experiments were conducted with microsomes. (iii) Using previously published data and in silico sequence analyses, we selected three candidate genes for novel flavonoid transporters. AtDTX 35 (At 4 g 25640) has been reported to be homologous to a tomato MATE which is upregulated in the tomato mutant, ANT 1 encoding proteins involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis (Mathews et al, 2003). We started our approach with downregulation of DTX 35 gene with RNAi in PAP 1 overexpressing line, which due to hyperaccumulation of anthocyanin exhibits purple pigmentation. Interestingly, numerous lines carrying the RNAi construct reverted from purple color to green. We describe that DTX 35 was unable to complement tt 12 seed phenotype and its promoter tissue activity is not specific in young seedlings. AtDTX 31 (At 1 g 12950) {{has been shown to be}} transcriptionally upregulated in Arabidopsis roots under salt treatment and displayed a similarity to proteins predominantly expressed in tomato fruits (Maathuis, 2006). To investigate if DTX 31 is expressed in salt stress conditions, we performed sqPCR analyses and examined if DTX 31 promoter activity is also tissue specific. We describe that DTX 31 is highly expressed in the roots of Arabidopsis subjected to salt stress and its promoter‘s spatial activity in response to high concentration of salt. AtDTX 28 (At 5 g 44050) has been reported to be induced after UV-B treatment, which is a main reason for increase in the transcript abundance of genes, including MYB 12 (the transcription factor) which are involved in the flavonol biosynthesis. We investigated if DTX 28 expression in MYB 12 overexpressing line, myb 12 knock-out line and triple knock-out line myb 11 -myb 12 -myb 111 is different in comparison to the wild-type line by sqPCR and HPLC analyses. We describe that DTX 28 does not show higher transcript level in MYB 12 overexpressing lines compared to the wild-type and no differences were observed in metabolic profiles between mutants and a wild-type...|$|R
