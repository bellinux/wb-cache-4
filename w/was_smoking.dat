The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{was a heavy}} smoker. In a December 1977 {{interview}} with Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Burton admitted he <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> 60–100 cigarettes per day. According to his younger brother, as stated in Graham Jenkins's 1988 book Richard Burton: My Brother, he smoked {{at least a hundred}} cigarettes a day. His father, also a heavy drinker, refused to acknowledge his son's talents, achievements and acclaim. In turn, Burton declined to attend the funeral, after his father died from a cerebral haemorrhage in January 1957 at age 81.|$|E

25|$|Marlin A. Gray (September 29, 1967– October 26, 2005) {{was convicted}} of aiding and abetting and {{executed}} by the U.S. state of Missouri by lethal injection. His conviction was for {{being part of a}} group of four men who, on April 5, 1991, sexually assaulted and then murdered two sisters, and attempted to murder the sisters' cousin on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Missouri. Gray continued to protest his innocence saying that although he was at the bridge at the time, he <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> cannabis in a nearby car. On December 9, 1992, Gray {{was convicted of}} two counts of first-degree murder and was executed on October 26, 2005. He maintained his innocence to the end.|$|E

He had also talked of experiencing a shipwreck and <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> a briar pipe which carried the initials [...] "R.C.T."

The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E

Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time.

She voluntarily turned herself in and was held overnight. Police said, at her arrival she was [...] "in no fit state" [...] to be interviewed. Ten days later, Winehouse was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs after a video of her apparently smoking crack cocaine was passed to the police in January, but was released on bail {{a few hours later}} because they could not confirm, from the video, what she <b>was</b> <b>smoking.</b> The Crown Prosecution Service considered charging her, but cleared her when it could not establish that the substance in the video was a controlled drug. Some members of Parliament reacted negatively. Two London residents were subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine and ecstasy to Winehouse. One of the pair was sentenced to two years in prison on 13 December 2008, while the other received a two-year community order.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the flight}} spotted no Chinese, at 14:40 Koenig radioed that Brown {{appeared}} to be trailing fuel. The damage had likely come by small arms fire from Chinese infantry, who were known {{to hide in the}} snow and to ambush passing aircraft by firing in unison. At least one bullet had ruptured a fuel line. Brown, losing fuel pressure and increasingly unable to control the aircraft, dropped his external fuel tanks and rockets and attempted to land the craft in a snow-covered clearing {{on the side of a}} mountain. Brown crashed into a bowl-shaped valley at approximately [...] The aircraft broke up violently upon impact and was destroyed. In the crash, Brown's leg was pinned beneath the fuselage of the aircraft, and he stripped off his helmet and gloves in an attempt to free himself, before waving to the other pilots, who were circling close overhead. The other pilots had thought he had died in the crash. Brown had crash-landed near Somong-ni, [...] behind Chinese lines in [...] weather, and the other pilots began a Mayday radio to any heavy transport aircraft in the area as they canvassed the mountain for any sign of Chinese ground forces who might threaten Brown. They received a signal that a rescue helicopter would come as soon as possible, but Brown's aircraft <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> and a fire had started near its internal fuel tanks.|$|E
500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life.

500|$|In Washington, D.C., both Blaine and Sherman were {{disappointed}} by their first-ballot vote totals. Blaine {{had been told}} that he should expect around 300 first-ballot votes, but his actual total fell sixteen short, and it was also one vote fewer than the total he received on the first ballot at the 1876 Convention. Sherman was told to expect 110 votes, which was significantly lower than the expected totals for Blaine and Grant. However, Sherman felt his chance would come later, when the Grant vote split apart. After Sherman heard his first-ballot vote totals, he grew visibly angry that [...] "some of them [...] were taken away from him before the ballot began." [...] He was upset that nine Ohio delegates bolted from Sherman and voted instead for his opponent, James G. Blaine. Sherman blamed Blaine for causing the delegates to bolt from Ohio [...] "by [...] falsehood, ridicule and treachery." [...] In Galena, Illinois, Grant did not express any emotions after being told about the first-ballot vote totals. As one newsman reported, [...] "he silent soldier <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> his cigar with all his usual serenity." [...] Grant's wife, Julia, expected a deadlock, and suggested to her husband that he surprise the delegates in Chicago with a visit. Grant thought this was unwise because it gave an appearance of bad luck and bad manners. Despite his wife's attempts to change his mind, Grant remained adamant.|$|E

2500|$|The club <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> hot at {{the plate}} on April 15, with a new Busch III record of six home runs in a 14-3 {{thrashing}} of Cincinnati. Matt Holliday hit his first two home runs of the season, Aledmys Díaz and Randal Grichuk both also hit their second on the year, and Brandon Moss and Matt Adams homered off the bench. [...] Moss' and Adams' home runs were the fifth and sixth off the bench in 2016. The club had only four in the entire 2015 season. [...] The six home runs gave the team 17 in its first 10 games.

2500|$|The name [...] "Grateful Dead" [...] {{was chosen}} from a dictionary. According to Phil Lesh, in his {{autobiography}} (pp.62), [...] "... picked up an old Britannica World Language Dictionary ..... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'" [...] The definition there was [...] "the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, {{as an act of}} charity, arranged their burial." [...] According to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the Funk & Wagnalls Folklore Dictionary, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of Fictionary. In the Garcia biography, Captain Trips, author Sandy Troy states that the band <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> the psychedelic DMT at the time. The term [...] "grateful dead" [...] appears in folktales of a variety of cultures. In mid-1969, Phil Lesh told another version of the story to Carol Maw, a young Texan visiting with the band in Marin County who also ended up going on the road with them to the Fillmore East and Woodstock. In this version, Phil said, [...] "Jerry found the name spontaneously when he picked up a dictionary and the pages fell open. The words 'grateful' and 'dead' appeared straight opposite each other across the crack between the pages in unrelated text." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 1974, García {{was visiting}} {{with some friends}} in her apartment. Medrano also had a guest, with whom he <b>was</b> <b>smoking</b> marijuana. Louie Castillo and Miguel Jimenez, Soledad locals and acquaintances of Medrano, arrived {{in a state of}} {{inebriation}} to purchase heroin from Medrano. They began harassing García and her friends, who left García and the others at the apartment. Soon an argument arose between Medrano and Castillo, who was envious of Medrano's status as the primary drug connection in Soledad and was resentful that an [...] "outsider" [...] had become so successful. The argument became physical, and Medrano was winning the fight (Castillo was a wiry seventeen-year-old) until the 300-pound Jimenez intervened, beating Medrano and threatening him with a knife. Jimenez and Castillo took García to an alley behind the building where Jimenez restrained and Castillo raped her, according to García's testimony, [...] "to show me what a hometown boy was." [...] The two men left the scene for a neighbor's house. Shortly after arriving, they (or someone else) called the García-Medrano residence, laughing, taunting, and threatening García's life if she did not leave town. García armed herself with her son's [...]22 rifle and she and Medrano drove the six blocks to the residence where Castillo and Jimenez were located. Accounts vary as to precisely what occurred next, but by most of them, Jimenez again brandished his knife and García shot him. Castillo, meanwhile, escaped into a nearby park. Medrano and García continued to the home of the two friends that had visited her earlier, and when police arrived, she surrendered to them without incident.|$|E
