5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> market every afternoon, {{not so much for}} buying things, but to interact with the people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{opened the}} 2010 season {{at home against}} the Connecticut Huskies, the first ever meeting between the two schools. Michigan celebrated the re-dedication of Michigan Stadium with a special flyover by a World War II era B-25 bomber from the nearby Yankee Air Museum in Ypsilanti Township, and then another flyover {{immediately}} following the national anthem by two A-10 aircraft. Brock Mealer—the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer—led the team onto the field by <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> banner and touching it, which sparked a standing ovation from the crowd. Elliot Mealer had only recently regained the ability to walk following injuries in a car crash.|$|E

Near the end, Booker T began to bash Roode's leg against the ringpost. Afterwards, Roode began <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> backstage area as Booker T followed continuing the fight as the referee counted out both men, ending the contest in a draw. Booker T and Roode fought throughout the backstage area into the parking lot, where Roode pulled Banks from the driver's seat of a car before making his own get away leaving Booker T and Banks behind.|$|E

25|$|The Trail of Tears is {{the name}} given to the forced {{movement}} of {{the peoples of the}} Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations out of their home, <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indian Territory under President Andrew Jackson to make their homelands available to white settlers. This was a comparable experience of rejection from long time homelands, with the difference that these tribes never returned home, but were given reservations, ever-shrinking, in a place and climate unlike their historic lands.|$|E
25|$|The Super Bowl was {{considered}} a level one national security event. To that end, the New Jersey State Police and the NFL host committee installed a 2.5-mile chain-link perimeter fence around the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which {{is located at the}} intersection of a number of highways. Security planners stated that access to the area would be strictly limited and regulated. To that end, parking spaces were greatly reduced, tailgate parties restricted and <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> venue strictly prohibited. Taxis and limousines were not permitted to drop off passengers. Passengers for trains to the stadium were limited in what they carry and were screened before boarding.|$|E

25|$|On January 30, 1900, Governor William Goebel, {{flanked by}} two bodyguards, was mortally wounded by an assassin while <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> State Capitol in {{downtown}} Frankfort. Goebel was contesting the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899, which William S. Taylor was initially believed to have won. For several months, J. C. W. Beckham, Goebel's running mate, and Taylor fought over who was the legal governor, until the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in May in favor of Beckham. After fleeing to Indiana, Taylor was indicted as a co-conspirator in Goebel's assassination. Goebel is the only governor of a U.S. state to have been assassinated while in office.|$|E
25|$|Spencer and his {{new chief}} secretary, Gladstone's nephew and Hartington's brother Lord Frederick Cavendish, crossed to Ireland on 5 May, but Cavendish and the {{permanent}} under-secretary, Thomas Henry Burke, were murdered by extremist Irish nationalists {{the next day in}} Phoenix Park, Dublin, while <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Viceregal Lodge where Spencer was staying. Spencer, assisted by George Trevelyan, his new secretary, was now faced with the difficult task of pacifying Ireland. Spencer acted quickly to reform the Irish police forces and destroy the secret societies which had been responsible for the murders. He attracted some criticism for his handling of a group of murders in Maamtrasna - one of the supposed criminals, Myles Joyce, had been hanged while still proclaiming his innocence, leading to a great deal of condemnation of Spencer from Irish Nationalist sources. The end of Spencer's second tenure as viceroy saw the successful visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Ireland, but Spencer's efforts to get the Queen to agree {{to the creation of a}} royal residence in Ireland were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E

25|$|On November 23, {{during the}} main event of Survivor Series, Sting made his first-ever {{appearance}} in a WWE ring by attacking Triple H with a Scorpion Death Drop and also costing Team Authority the match. On January 19, 2015, Sting made his live Raw debut by appearing backstage during {{the main event}}, then <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage, causing a distraction and costing Authority members Big Show, Kane and Seth Rollins their handicap match against John Cena; this win gave the recently fired Dolph Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan their jobs back. Triple H challenged Sting to a face-to-face confrontation on the January 26 episode of Raw. Sting accepted this challenge on the February 16 episode of Raw by sending a Sting doppelganger into the ring to scare Triple H, after airing a vignette {{on the big screen}} accepting Triple H's challenge. Sting and Triple H had a confrontation at Fastlane on February 22. Following physicality between the two, Sting pointed to the WrestleMania 31 sign with his baseball bat, issuing a challenge for the event that was accepted by Triple H. On the March 16 episode of Raw, Sting made a surprise appearance and helped Randy Orton fight off the Authority. Immediately following on the WWE Network, Sting spoke for the first time in-ring. He lost at WrestleMania 31 in a match involving interference from D-Generation X and New World Order members, but shook hands with Triple H afterward.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} simple but {{effective}} method for recovering 3 D human body <b>walking</b> parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> image plane from monocular video sequences based on 3 D human body model, using robust image matching and specific search strategy. Monocular 3 D body tracking is challenging, because {{of a large number}} of free parameters. These parameters are reduced to 12 in this paper under the assumption of <b>walking</b> parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> image plane. <b>To</b> effectively measure <b>the</b> matching error, a pose evaluation function combining both boundary and region information is provided. Simultaneously, we calculate the physical forces that are used as heuristic information in subsequent search. Experiments with both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate that our approach has an encouraging performance. ...|$|R
