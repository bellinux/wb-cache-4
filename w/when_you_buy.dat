500|$|Professor David Nutt, former {{chair of}} the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in the UK has said, [...] "people are better off taking ecstasy or amphetamines than those [...] we know nothing about" [...] and [...] "Who knows what's in [...] <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> it? We don't have a testing system. It could be very dangerous, we just don't know. These {{chemicals}} have never been put into animals, let alone humans." [...] Les King, {{a former member of}} the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts. He also told the BBC, [...] "all we can say is [...] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and wait until we have some better scientific evidence to support that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} {{version of the}} album contains ten tracks and the deluxe edition adds three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Editions of the album sold at Walmart stores in North America feature a censored version of [...] "The Devil Beneath My Feet". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as [...] "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." [...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, {{and you get a}} free record with it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> a gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{said the}} film [...] "works and it {{delivers}} just {{about what you}} expect <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> your ticket" [...] but felt that it [...] "lacks the mordant humor of the Romero version" [...] and the [...] "plot flatlines compared to the 1979 version, which was trickier, wittier and smarter." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety described it as an unnecessary remake that will appeal mostly to young adult audiences who {{have not seen the}} original film. [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film [...] "has no patience for such subtleties" [...] as Romero's thematic concerns or suspense-building. [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Snyder's blood feast is strictly by the numbers: this second-rater could be the world's most expensive Troma film." [...] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Good zombie fun, the remake of George A. Romero's [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] is the best proof in ages that cannibalizing old material sometimes works fiendishly well." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Instead, the new [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] satirizes itself and satirizes its genre, and, on its own unambitious terms, the movie succeeds. It's silly, witty and good-natured, not scary so much as icky, and not horrifying or horrible but consistently amusing." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated it [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "Commercial director Zack Snyder, making a killer feature debut, trades homemade cheesiness for knowing style, revels in the sophistication of modern special effects, and stomps off with the best remake – er, ”re-envisioning” – of a horror classic in memory." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that the remake streamlines the original film [...] "by discarding everything special about it in favor of pure visceral effect".|$|E

6000|$|The road lay {{through the}} middle of an empty space which {{seemed to me to be}} a hundred yards wide between the fences.

I think it is best to put up with {{information}} the way you get it; and seem satisfied with it, and surprised at it, and grateful for it, and say, [...] "My word!" [...] and never let on. It was a wide space; I could tell you how wide, in chains and perches and furlongs and things, but that would not help you any.

40|$|Wh {{questions}} with multiple wh elements pose a special problem within the overall analysis of wh-type constructions. In a language like English, which only allows one wh element {{to be in}} the fronted discourse-prominent position, any additional wh element occupies an “in situ ” position; i. e. the position of the clause-internal grammatical function. 1 As noted at least since Kuno and Robinson (1972), the choice of which wh element is fronted is not free. They cite examples such as the following: (1) a. Who did what? b. Who went where? c. What happened to whom? d. What did you give to whom? (2) a. *What did who do? b. *Where did who go? c. *To whom did what happen? d. *To whom did you give what? / *Who did you give what to? A similar effect obtains in (a subset of) languages which front multiple wh elements, as seen in the following examples from Bulgarian (Bošković 2002 : 354). (3) a. Koj kogo običa? who whom loves ‘Who loves whom?’ b. *Kogo koj običa? whom who loves Expressing the constraint in movement terms, Kuno and Robinson state that a wh element cannot cross over another wh element. Stated this way, the constraint seems rather arbitrary. It becomes even more arbitrary when compared with cases such as the following: (4) a. Where did <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What did <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> where? b. <b>When</b> did <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What did <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>when...</b>|$|R
