25|$|Tinamous are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} skyward allowing the rain to <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe often enough to tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.|$|E
25|$|M. a. athi of the Kenyan {{highlands}} {{is typically}} coloured, but like other tropical races, lacks the rufous nape. Most accepted races are distinguished {{based on the}} colour of the back or underpart plumage, or the amount of streaking on the ear coverts and flanks. High altitude races M. a. nyikae and M. a. nigrescens, which occur above 2,000 meters, have very dark upper part plumages and increased flank streaking. M. a. tropicalis which is found above 1,000 meters has a solid rufous <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> the underparts. Of the southern African races, those in the southeast are the largest and darkest (cf. M. a. africana and M. a. rostrata), with a cline towards lightly streaked and pale pinkish plumages in the northwest.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{underground}} dams: a sub-surface and a sand-storage dam. A sub-surface dam is built across an aquifer or drainage route from an impervious layer (such as solid bedrock) up to just below the surface. They can be constructed of a variety of materials to include bricks, stones, concrete, steel or PVC. Once built, the water stored behind the dam raises the water table and is then extracted with wells. A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or wadi. It must be strong, as floods will <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> its crest. Over time, sand accumulates in layers behind the dam, which helps store water and, most importantly, prevent evaporation. The stored water can be extracted with a well, through the dam body, or by means of a drain pipe.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the mixing}} {{engineers}} {{were aware of}} Timbaland and Furtado's rock influences, the songs were mixed on a mixing board in the studio instead of [...] "the fancy mixer at the end". Furtado said she preferred the louder volume that process gave to the album because she wanted it to sound like her demo tapes, which she prefers to her finished albums. She said, [...] "It didn't have that final <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> it; it didn't have the final pressing at the end, save for a couple sounds".|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the smaller}} islets that {{surround}} those in the main list are obscure and none have ever been permanently inhabited in modern times. Nonetheless, some have a degree of historical significance. Castle Mestag off Stroma is {{the ruins of a}} once fortified stack accessible only via a drawbridge. Some islets are identified as [...] "storm washed" [...] meaning that, although a proportion of their bulk remains above mean sea level, large waves <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> the top of them during storms, rendering them uninhabitable.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{vignette}} that presented the video as [...] "visual 1". Sporting black lingerie, Grande is seen posing and singing {{in front of a}} curtain and on a bed. Shades of blue, purple and pink <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> her {{over the course of the}} video, which is just the singer on her own. Though she keeps a fairly stoic expression for the majority of the video, she is seen laughing towards the end as the screen fills with static. The video surpassed 100 million views on May 18, 2016, making it Grande's tenth VEVO-certified music video after [...] "Right There" [...] (2013).|$|E

500|$|In steeply banked beaches off Península Valdés, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands, {{killer whales}} feed on South American sea lions and {{southern}} elephant seals in shallow water, even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling {{back to the}} sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behaviour, and can require years of practice for the young. Killer whales can then release the animal near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. [...] "Wave-hunting" [...] killer whales spy-hop to locate Weddell seals, crabeater seals, leopard seals, and penguins resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other killer whales lie in wait.|$|E
500|$|Hearing cries, Bourke {{entered the}} harbour {{but could not}} {{identify}} the lost men. Despite heavy machine gun and artillery fire, Bourke returned {{to the scene of}} the wreck four times before they discovered two sailors and Vindictives badly wounded navigation officer Sir John Alleyne clinging to an upturned boat. Hauling the men aboard, Bourke turned for the safety of the open sea, but as he did, two [...] shells struck the launch, smashing the lifeboat and destroying the compressed air tanks. This stalled the engines and caused a wave of highly corrosive acid to <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> the deck, causing severe damage to the launch's hull and almost suffocating the unconscious Alleyne. Under heavy fire, the boat staggered out of the harbour and was taken under tow by another late-arriving motor launch. After the operation, Bourke's launch was discovered to have 55bullet and shrapnel holes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{freshwater}} lens of each atoll is {{a fragile}} system. Tropical cyclones and other storm events also result in wave <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> and extreme high water also occurs during spring tides. These events {{can result in}} salt water contamination of the fresh groundwater lens. [...] Periods of low rainfall can also result in contraction of the freshwater lens as the coconut trees and other vegetation draw up the water at a greater than recharge than it can be recharged. The over extraction of ground water to supply human needs has a similar result as drought conditions.|$|E
2500|$|This third {{novel of}} Port William begins with Jack Beechum {{as a very}} old man in 1952 and {{continues}} back into his youth and maturity to uncover his life and work as a dedicated farmer, conflicted husband, and living link to past generations. The story ranges from the Civil War to just past World War II. Josh Hurst comments on Berry's ability to avoid certain narrative pitfalls, [...] "Jack's story could be presented us either as heroic ballad or as cautionary —and there is much in his life to support both admiration and gentle tisk-tisking—but the gift of this book is how it allows a man's memories to <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> us as though unshaped by narrative or conscious editorializing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once a tin-bearing valley {{had been}} identified, the stream-workers would arrange {{a stream of}} water, {{probably}} carried by a leat from higher up the valley, and starting at the lowest end of the deposit they would dig a trench (known as the [...] "tye") as deep as possible to allow the finer gangue to be washed away. From there they would start working up the valley, using the stream of water to <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> the debris they had loosened from the bed with picks. This method of working leaves characteristic evidence in the valleys - a series of ridges of the larger gangue material, sometimes roughly perpendicular to, sometimes coaxial with {{the line of the}} valley, sometimes apparently haphazard, all bounded by a scarp which marked the edge of the worked ground and whose height relates to the depth of the deposits.|$|E
2500|$|Executed in the [...] or {{carefully}} delineated (as {{opposed to}} [...] or hatsuboku, [...] "splashed ink") style, {{the landscape is}} thought {{to be one of the}} artist's final works. The vertical accent of two pine trees takes the place of a central mountain peak, while the distant shore has a [...] "modern" [...] horizon line unusual for the period. The zigzag path leading to a pavilion on a lookout point contributes to the painting's considerable [...] "spatial depth". Journeying along the path are an old wanderer accompanied by a young attendant, recurrent figures in Sesshū's landscapes. The contrast between the dilute ink of the sea and sky and the more concentrated rocks and vegetation, and the expressive use of the background tone of the paper, helps give the painting its [...] "impression of extreme intensity". Touches of colour include green <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> the pine needles and of orange in the buildings; ink added to the pale yellow wash on the path almost gives the effect of shadows cast by the rocks.|$|E

60|$|This {{was what}} had happened. Just about {{the centre of}} the reef is a large flat-topped rock--it may be twenty feet in the square--known to the Bryngelly {{fishermen}} as Table Rock. In ordinary weather, even at high tide, the waters scarcely cover this rock, but when there is any sea they <b>wash</b> <b>over</b> it with great violence. On to this rock Geoffrey and Beatrice had been hurled by the breaker. Fortunately for them it was thickly overgrown with seaweed, which to some slight extent broke the violence of their fall. As it chanced, Geoffrey was knocked senseless by the shock; but Beatrice, whose hand he still held, fell on to him and, {{with the exception of a}} few bruises and a shake, escaped unhurt.|$|E
