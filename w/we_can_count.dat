[...] Both Runyon and Zaladonis believe, but are not completely certain, that the skimmer received return hostile fire; Runyon commented, [...] "It was the scariest night of my life." [...] Runyon also stated that he is [...] "100 percent certain" [...] that no one on the boat fired a grenade launcher. Zaladonis has noted that Schachte went on [...] "a bunch of" [...] other skimmer missions and speculated that Schachte might have inadvertently mixed up his dates.|$|E
