40|$|Firewood is {{commonly}} used around the world, but {{little is known about}} the work involved in its production and associated accidents. The objectives were to identify relationships between accidents and time exposure, workers’ age and sex, equipment used and work activities in family forestry's firewood production. Data from a postal survey in Northern Sweden were compared to a database of injuries in the same region. Most accidents occurred to 50 – 69 year old men, who also worked most hours. No significant differences in sex and age were found between expected and recorded accident frequencies when calculated from total work hours; however, when calculated using numbers of active persons significant differences were found for both age and sex. Frequency of accidents per unit worked time was higher for machine involving activities than for other activities. Accidents that occurred when using <b>wedge</b> <b>splitter</b> machines were responsible for most of this overrepresentation. Fingers were the most commonly injured body parts. Mean accident rate for the equipment used was 87 accidents per million work hours, and the rate was highest for wedge splitters (122 accidents per million work hours). Exposure to elevated risks due to violation of safety procedures is discussed, as well as possible preventative measures...|$|E
40|$|Self-employed family {{forestry}} {{refers to}} forestry work {{conducted by the}} owners themselves, either alone or with assistants, on their forest holdings. Despite the term self-employed, most persons are not economically dependent on the work, which is mainly conducted in their leisure time. In Sweden, half of all work time conducted {{and most of the}} lethal accidents in forestry occur in self-employed family forestry. Nevertheless, knowledge about the sector is limited. The objective of this thesis was to examine efficiency and safety in self-employed family forestry. Self-employment in family forestry was found to be common and there were no signs that it is likely to decline in the near future. Two thirds of the forest owners were to some extent self-employed in cutting, extraction, planting and pre-commercial thinning. Self-employed owners differed in a number of demographic factors (e. g. age and sex) compared to other forest owners. Extensive sales of suitable equipment indicated no decline in the near future. Firewood-processing was also found to be common in family forestry, as were related accidents. Exposure in terms of work time explained more of the accident occurrence than numbers of active persons, age or sex, and <b>wedge</b> <b>splitter</b> machines were associated with a disproportionably large number of accidents in terms of hours used. Since manual tree felling causes the majority of lethal accidents in forestry, a method was developed to enable evaluation of felling tools’ capacity to force trees to fall after cuts {{have been made in the}} stem. The method proved to be suitable for the intended purpose, and its practical utility was theoretically demonstrated in the assessment of a tools’ capacity to deal with trees with an unfavourable inclination. In addition, the impact of increased mechanisation of small-scale firewood-processing was analysed in an experimental study and was found to improve efficiency by 25 - 33 %. It is argued that self-employment is important for Swedish forestry, especially for the future voluntary supply of raw material from family forests. Hence, self-employed family forestry deserves encouragement and further attention should be paid to the activity and the conditions that affect it in order to increase efficiency and safety...|$|E

40|$|Abstract　To find optimum {{parameters}} of a bistable wall attachment amplifier having higher recovery pressure, an experimental research {{is performed using}} devices with {{two different types of}} splitter. Devices with a wedge type splitter(1),(3) are not so good for obtaining higher recovery pressure because of mixing reattached flow with surrounding fluid in the output duct. For avoiding this phenomenon and getting higher recovery pressure, devices with a pentagonal splitter(2),(4) was originated so as to obtain the optimum output duct width free from the position of the splitter tip. As compared with devices with the <b>wedge</b> type <b>splitter,</b> the remarkable merits of devices with the pentagonal splitter are observed. The recovery pressure gaind by closing the output duct is in most cases less 45 % of the supply for devices with the <b>wedge</b> type <b>splitter,</b> but over 45 % for devices with the pentagonal splitter. 　　側壁付着型２安定素子の設計には数多くの変数があって，その設計基準を定めるのは非常に困難である。本報では高い回復圧を得ることを目的として，スプリッタの形を楔形と駒形の 2 通りに変え，その各々に対してベント位置，スプリッタ角を変えて実験を行なった。　　楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，出力端で再付着流とまわりの流休とが混り合うために一般的に高い回復圧が得られ難い。ところが駒形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子が起す上記のような現象はなく，下記に示すような著しい利点がみられた。　(1) スプリッタの位置に関係なく出カダクト巾を一定にできるので，統一的な実験が行なえる。　(2) 回復圧が非常に高い（楔形の場合は 45 %以下,駒形の場合ほ 45 %以上）。　(3) メモリタイプの素子が多く得られる。　　又，ベントに関しては， 3 次元方向にベントを開けた場合には，製作が容易であるいう利点があるが，積重ねて使用することができない，回復圧が低くメモリタイプの素子が少ないなどの欠点が多いことから，ペントは 2 次元方向に開けるのが望ましいということがわかった...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study on hand injury from powered wood {{splitters}} was to describe injury epidemiology and anatomy, to rate injury severity, to evaluate the outcome after injury and to describe factors of possible importance for the occurrence of injury. By searching a computerized patient registry, 131 patients injured by wood splitters from 1995 to 2001 were identified. Information was obtained from hospital records and radiographs, a written questionnaire and a structured telephone interview. Injury severity was rated according to the Hand Injury Severity Scoring System (HISS system) and the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Outcome was evaluated with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand outcome questionnaire (DASH) and, in 26 of the most severely injured patients, with the Sollerman test. Forty-six percent of the injuries occurred during April or May. Wedge splitters caused 82 % of all injuries and most often injured the index finger, while screw splitters caused 18 % of all injuries and most often injured the metacarpus. Screw splitters caused palmar perforation and thumb avulsion. Sixty-three percent of all patients had an amputation or devascularising injury. The reliability of HISS rating was good. The mean Hand Injury Severity Score (HISS) was 63 which is equivalent to a severe hand injury. The mean ISS was 3. 7. Nineteen percent of patients had minor, 31 % had moderate, 23 % had severe and 27 % had major injury according to the HISS system. Children had more severe injuries than adults. There was no significant difference regarding HISS or DASH scores between wedge and screw splitter injuries. The mean DASH score was 15, indicating moderate residual sequelae, but patients without sequelae and patients with grave sequelae were found in all HISS severity grades. There was a weak but significant correlation between the HISS and DASH scores. The mean Sollerman score in the injured hand was 66, indicating significantly impaired hand function. Twenty-nine percent of splitters were home-made. Very few machines had the safety measures required by European Standards. Children were present during splitting in at least 15 % of cases. Not being alone at the machine was one cause of <b>wedge</b> <b>splitter</b> injury. Glove use was one cause of screw splitter injury. Hand injury from powered wood splitters is a significant problem. Many of the injuries are severe, and cause long term sequels and impairment of hand function. Prevention is essential and should focus on unsafe machines and dangerous patterns of use...|$|E

40|$|To {{validate}} the increasingly used numerical models for optimization and verification of the designs subjected to bird strike, initial (calibration) tests are a necessity prior to full scale testing. Bird strike calibration tests on rigid targets specifically, give a valuable insight {{in the complex}} behaviour of a bird. This paper {{presents the results of}} a series of bird strike tests and simulations on three rigid targets (a plate, a <b>wedge</b> and a <b>splitter)</b> to quantify the forces originating from the change of momentum and splitting of the bird. In this study, momentum transfer is the key parameter to compare birds with different masses, materials, speeds, etc., as proposed in the reference works from the 20 th century. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} fourfold: (i) to introduce another way to measure Momentum transfer on these kinds of structures and therefore get more consistent results, (ii) to show that gelatine generates similar impact forces. as real birds, (iii) to point out that apart from the change of direction of the momentum, the deviatoric and/or dissipating constitutive behaviour of the bird also plays an important role and (iv) to show that a simple plate structure can be used to measure the residual energy of the bird remainders after an impact event. In a series of numerical simulations, the performance of a SPH bird with an EOS material model is used to {{validate the}} analytical models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
