5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> {{participate}} in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2012, Edge (with {{his usual}} long hair cut short) was {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian, during WrestleMania XXVIII weekend. Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be on the show that night, also declaring that he would no longer be under contract with WWE in a couple of days. After this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E

5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} immortality. The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve immortality, one <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in this world, and be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E
5|$|Vijender competed at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, in the welterweight division, {{but lost}} to Mustafa Karagollu of Turkey by {{a score of}} 20–25. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, he {{defeated}} England's Neil Perkins in the semifinal but lost to South Africa's Bongani Mwelase in the final, thus leaving with a bronze medal. He decided to move up in weight and Vijender {{took part in the}} middleweight (75kg) division at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, where he won the bronze medal in a lost semifinal bout against Kazakhstan's Bakhtiyar Artayev with the final score of 24–29. Initially Vijender <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> compete because of a back injury, but he recovered in time to win the tournament and qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E
5|$|As Lydia recovers in hospital, Zoe {{is charged}} with Sarah's murder. Realising she has escaped arrest for accidentally killing Sarah, Lydia lies to Charlotte, telling her how she and Sarah planned to travel and even adopt. Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard) confronts Lydia over the day of Sarah's death and is shocked when Lydia claims she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> die. Archie goes to the police, however they do not do anything. During Sarah's funeral, Archie arrives at her wake and announces Lydia caused her death. When no one {{believes}} him, he is removed. Before Zoe's court case, Mike goes to visit her. Lydia tries to tell Mike that she will try to appear innocent. When he returns, and claims he knows {{she could not have}} killed Sarah, Lydia manipulates him into believing that she was just trying to get him on side. At this time, Charlotte and Lydia get back together. At the court case, Lydia lies whilst giving a statement. Charlotte accompanies Lydia to the case, agreeing to keep their new relationship quiet.

5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer is in {{bed with}} a young woman, Jessica (Kristin Richardson). After he {{declares}} his love for her, she realizes he is late for a meeting. As he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing thousands of dollars in cash he claims she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone to get money for an investment that will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas) emerge from another room. He suddenly calls off the con, drops his briefcase of money, and rushes out of their house.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{earliest}} days of the team, the number 31 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be issued to any other player. The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' In the first three decades of the team's existence, the number 31 was only seen once: in 1969, when reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice James (J.D.) Williams wore it for his first two seasons.|$|E

Intra-specific competition is taken into account. Under additional technical assumptions, we establish that the model admits a globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium point. This ensures persistence of the species. Our proof relies on a Lyapunov function. 1...|$|R

25|$|An Estonian oil {{syndicate}} {{became a}} joint Estonian-Soviet enterprise in 1928 and Päts {{was hired by}} it as a legal consultant in 1930.

Its actions, almost entirely confined to the Gaza–Majdal corridor, were meant to create a naval blockade of the Egyptian expeditionary force in Palestine (considering ground actions in the operation, this would translate into complete encirclement). This would be achieved by preventing any Egyptian naval actions in the area, including naval supply, reinforcement or seaborne evacuation of forces. In addition, the naval service would draw major Egyptian forces to the theater, preventing them from fighting in other areas where ground and air attacks would take place.|$|E
