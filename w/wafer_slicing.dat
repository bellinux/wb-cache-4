Analysis of add-on slicing cost indicated that machine productivity seems to be a major limiting factor for ID saw, while expendible material costs are a major factor for both MBS and MWS saw. Slicing experience indicated that the most important factors controling final wafer cost are: (1) silicon cost (wafer thickness + kerf loss); (2) add-on slicing cost, and (3) mechanical yield.

40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of {{vibration}} control of a silicon <b>wafer</b> <b>slicing</b> blade cutting a crystal ingot. Transverse vibration is detrimental to the cutting performance of the slicing ID sawblade. A feedback control scheme is introduced to suppress the vibration of the blade under lateral dynamic disturbance. The rotating sawblade is clamped at the outer boundary and stressed initially in the radial direction, while the inner periphery is subjected to both stationary in-plane and dynamic lateral slicing loads from the workpiece. Furthermore, the normal pneumatic forces controlled by the PD algorithm are applied to the blade to control the vibration. Numerical results are presented for an actual SUS 301 blade cutting a 6 "-diameter silicon ingot at 1550 rpm.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand of silicon solar cells in PV industry calls for minimizing the material loses (kerf) during Si <b>wafer</b> <b>slicing.</b> The currently employed abrasive slicing methods {{are capable of}} slicing similar to 350 mu m thick wafers. Recent research efforts have put forward wire-EDM as a potential method. This work presents an extensive experimentation to understand the parametric effects that give ultra thin wafer while minimizing the kerf-loss and maximizing the slicing rate. Ultra thin wafers of size 130 - 150 mu m were fabricated using wire-EDM while controlling the input energy by avoiding wire or wafer breakage. The kerf-loss was reduced by similar to 50 % (121 mu m) while maintaining a high slicing rate of 1. 05 mm/min. A typical wafer and associated kerf profiles showed a wider thickness at the entry and exit than {{the middle of the}} wafer. An increase in open voltage and a decrease in servo voltage increase the slicing rate in frontal direction and cause a decrease in slicing rate in the lateral direction, consequently decreasing the kerf-loss.

40|$|The {{existing}} silicon ingot slicing methods adopt contact {{forces in}} slicing {{that could easily}} cause higher kerf loss and a larger variation in {{the thickness of the}} sliced wafers. Wire-EDM is a potential process for slicing of silicon ingots into wafers. This work therefore demonstrates capability of wire-EDM in silicon <b>wafer</b> <b>slicing</b> through a RSM based experimentation involving use of molybdenum wires of 40 - 120 mu m in diameter. During the experiments wafers of various height ranging from 50 to 150 mm were fabricated and capability of the process was assessed in minimizing the kerf width. It was evident that the kerf width reduces from 250 mu m to 50 mu m, when sliced by a 40 mu m diameter wire, which amounts to a reduction in kerf loss by 300 %. The slicing speed on the other hand could be increased by 40 - 50 % to 2. 5 mm/min over the conventional abrasive slicing. A multi-objective optimization methodology adopted gives parametric conditions that give minimum kerf width at the highest slicing speed and the lowest surface roughness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentration of VInH 4 is found much lower in <b>wafers</b> <b>sliced</b> from the ingot tail. The concentration of VInH 4 in Fe-doped InP is {{higher than that of}} the undoped InP. The concentration change of VInH 4 in an InP ingot is qualitatively in agreement with the mass action law expectation based on defect reactions. The influence of this complex on the electrical properties of n-type LEC undoped and Fe-doped InP is discussed. The high concentration of VInH 4 in the seed-end of an InP ingot correlates with two facts. The first is the high threshold concentrations of Fe and Zn required to get semi-insulating and p-type material, respectively. The second {{is that there is a}} large thermally induced reduction of carrier concentration in seed-end InP wafers than that of wafers from the ingot tail. The results reveal the influence of VInH 4 on the thermal stability of InP material due to the fact that the bond of hydrogen complex is weak and dissociates easily upon annealing. This dissociation has a relationship with the defects formed in high-temperature annealed InP, which are involved in the electrical compensation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to achieve high-efficiency, low-cost, commercial-ready, screen-printed Silicon (Si) solar cells by reducing material costs and raising cell efficiencies. Two specific solutions to material cost reduction are implemented in this thesis. The first one is low to medium concentrator (2 - 20 suns) Si solar cells. By using some optics to concentrate sunlight, the same amount of output power can be achieved with cell area reduced by a factor equal to the concentration ratio. Since the cost of optics is less than the semiconductor material, electricity price from the concentrator photovoltaics (PV) system is therefore reduced. The second solution is the use of epitaxially grown Si (epi-Si) wafers. This epi-Si technology bypasses three costly process steps (the need for polycrystalline silicon feedstock, ingot growth, and <b>wafer</b> <b>slicing)</b> compared to the traditional Si wafer technology and therefore reduces the material cost by up to 50 % in a finished PV module. In addition, high efficiency Si solar cells with reduced metal contact recombination are studied and modeled by implementation of passivated contacts composed of tunnel oxide, n+ polycrystalline Si and metal on top of n-type Si absorber to reduce the cost ($/Wp) of PV module.

40|$|Abstract: Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAcM) {{has been}} widely used for {{non-destructive}} evaluation (NDE) in various fields including general material characterization, electronics, and biomedicine. SAcM uses high-frequency acoustic waves (60 MHz to 2. 0 GHz) to reveal surface topography, subsurface features, and elastic properties of materials. With two unique advantages over other forms of material characterization, SAcM provides non-destructive subsurface imaging and offers the ability to visualize variations in elastic properties. These attributes make SAcM a valuable tool for near-surface material property characterization and flaw detection. The resolution of a SAcM can be as fine as 0. 5 mm, much {{higher than that of}} conventional ultrasonic NDE, which is typically about 500 mm. Consequently, SAcM is more suitable for microstructural characterization and fine-scale flaw detection.
