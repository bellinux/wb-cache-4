2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time I met him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> often and became friends.|$|E

I mean c'mon Red Hot Chili Peppers were vaguely interesting in the late 80s, but Christ they fucking suck, they suck. Don't talk about it anymore". Patton was asked in 2010 about the festivals and his relationship with Kiedis. Patton said [...] "It’s not worth talking about. I’ve {{no idea what it}} was about then and I don’t know now.

However, Trevor Dunn disputes this, and wrote, [...] "I was way more into Fishbone and Bad Manners back in the day." ...|$|E

60|$|Before I could {{knock at}} the door it was {{suddenly}} opened, and a man came running out with a lighted lantern in his hand. He stopped and held it up at the sight of me.

That was love as I know it; not Seth's sneaking rages, and Uncle Ben's sneaking fooleries, and Masters's sneaking conceit, but only love. And knowing that, I let Seth rage, and Uncle Ben dawdle, and Masters trifle--and for what? To keep them from me and my boy. They were satisfied, and we were happy." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{burst of}} passionate feeling over, with calmed {{thoughts}} we sat together, talking {{of the past}} and present. I alluded to the coldness of her letters; but the few minutes we had spent together sufficiently explained the origin of this. New feelings had arisen within her, which she was unable to express in writing to one whom she had only known in childhood; but <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again, and our intimacy was renewed as if nothing had intervened to check it. I detailed the incidents of my sojourn abroad, and then questioned her as to the changes that had taken place at home, the causes of Adrian's absence, and her secluded life.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} one old gentleman, with whom I really made friends. He was a bachelor, and {{was not only the}} author of numbers of books, but {{when he was a little}} boy had been {{presented}} by Charles Dickens himself with a copy of David Copperfield, and had actually sat on the young novelist's knee. No matter who it was he might be talking to, he used to snap his fingers at me in the most exciting fashion whenever <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the distance, and we often shared a quiet little talk together (I standing on a highish chair, perhaps, and he squatting beside me, his hands on his knees) in some corner of Mrs Monnerie's enormous drawing-room, well out of the mob.|$|E

After four months at a convalescent hospital in Warwick, England, he was reassigned to an engineering outfit and became part of the occupation forces in Germany. He recalled in 1970 that [...] "after Al Avison left, I started pencilling America stories from then on until the Army decided it could use my services to help win World War II. It seemed they needed a lot of men for the infantry at the time. I was called up, and so my artistic eye was used to qualify me as an expert marksman in an infantry regiment.

Besides, he spoke under the influence of a mad superstition that has got possession of him again. There is every excuse for him--there is no excuse for me. If I can't help being fond of him through it all, I must take the consequences and suffer. I deserve to suffer; I deserve neither love nor pity from anybody.--Good heavens, what a fool I am! And how unnatural all this would be, if it was written in a book! ...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{came to an}} ignominious end. [...] "There {{were some}} pretty horrid gigs", Stewart later recalled. [...] "One night we were booked to appear at a working men's club in Cardiff and when we arrived there {{we found that the}} posters outside the club said that {{starring}} that night was some Welsh tenor 'plus support group' - which meant us. That really choked me, the fact that we'd reached the stage where they didn't even bother to put our names up on the posters." [...] The band accepted a booking playing cabaret shows for a week, wearing white suits and red silk shirts and telling jokes between the songs. After one particularly disastrous gig the band argued and Stewart angrily declared the Mindbenders were finished. He dropped the other members off at their homes after the gig and said, [...] "That {{was the end of the}} Mindbenders. <b>We</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again after that." ...|$|R
6000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for {{the first}} time, my {{stepmother}} and I met necessarily as strangers. We were elaborately polite, and we each made a meritorious effort to appear at our ease. On her side, she found herself confronted by a young man, the new master of the house, who {{looked more like a}} foreigner than an Englishman--who, when he was congratulated (in view of the approaching season) on the admirable preservation of his partridges and pheasants, betrayed an utter want of interest in the subject; and who showed no sense of shame in acknowledging that his principal amusements were derived from reading books, and collecting insects. How I must have disappointed Mrs. Roylake! and how considerately she hid from me the effect that I had produced! ...|$|E

60|$|Misery loves company. Now {{and then}} at night, in out-of-the way, dimly lighted places, I found myself {{happening}} on another child of misfortune. He looked so seedy and forlorn, so homeless and friendless and forsaken, that I yearned toward him as a brother. I wanted to claim kinship with him and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together. The drawing toward each other must have been mutual; at any rate we got to falling together oftener, though still seemingly by accident; and although we did not speak or evince any recognition, I think the dull anxiety passed out of both of us when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and then for several hours we would idle along contentedly, wide apart, and glancing furtively in at home lights and fireside gatherings, out of the night shadows, and very much enjoying our dumb companionship.|$|E
60|$|That {{same day}} of our {{farewell}} I rode with my father to Yarmouth. My brother Geoffrey did not come with us, but we parted with kindly words, and of this I am glad, for <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again. No more was said between us as to Lily Bozard and our wooing of her, though I knew well enough that so soon as my back was turned {{he would try to}} take my place at her side, as indeed happened. I forgive it to him; in truth I cannot blame him much, for what man is there that would not have desired to wed Lily who knew her? Once we were dear friends, Geoffrey and I, but when we ripened towards manhood, our love of Lily came between us, and we grew more and more apart. It is a common case enough. Well, as it chanced he failed, so why should I think unkindly of him? Let me rather remember the affection of our childhood and forget the rest. God rest his soul.|$|R
6000|$|You {{see how far}} my {{imagination}} had gone towards readjustment when Mary returned into my life. You see how strange and distant it was to meet her again, changed completely into the great lady she had intended to be, speaking to me with the restrained and practised charm {{of a woman who}} is young and beautiful and prominent and powerful and secure. There was no immediate sense of shock in that resumption of our broken intercourse, {{it seemed to me that}} night simply that something odd and curious had occurred. I do not remember how we parted that evening or whether <b>we</b> even <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> after dinner was over, but from that hour forth Mary by insensible degrees resumed her old predominance in my mind. I woke up in the night and thought about her, and next day I found myself thinking of her, remembering things out of the past and recalling and examining every detail of the overnight encounter. How cold and ineffective we had been, both of us! We had been like people resuming a disused and partially forgotten language. Had she changed towards me? Did she indeed want to see me again or was that invitation a mere demonstration of how entirely unimportant seeing me or not seeing me had become? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ada Cameron! She must be Ada Frame's daughter, then," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Knowles in excitement. Then, seeing Pauline's puzzled face, she explained: [...] "Years ago, when I was a child, I always {{spent my}} summers {{on the farm}} of my uncle, John Frame. My cousin, Ada Frame, was the dearest friend I ever had, but after we grew up <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> nothing of <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> for I went with my parents to Europe for several years, and Ada married a neighbour's son, Alec Cameron, and went out west. Her father, who was my only living {{relative}} other than my parents, died, and I never heard anything more of Ada until about eight years ago, when somebody {{told me she was}} dead and had left no family. That part of the report cannot have been true if this girl is her daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Athalbrand {{comes to}} meet us!" [...] cried one, {{and in a}} minute every man was looking to his arms. There {{was no time for}} plans, since in that low light and mist the vessels were almost bow to bow before <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> My father's ship ran in between two of Athalbrand's that were sailing abreast, while mine and that of Ragnar found {{themselves}} almost alongside of the others. On both sides the sails were let down, for none had any thought of flight. Some rushed to the oars and got enough of them out to work the ships. Others ran to the grappling irons, and the rest began to shoot with their bows. Before one could count two hundred from the time of sighting, the war cry of [...] "Valhalla! Valhalla! Victory or Valhalla!" [...] broke upon the silence of the night and the battle had begun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Hi's all right," [...] {{answered}} Miss Lowery. [...] "Yes, I {{could get}} along with him fine. He's promised me an automobile and a motor-boat. But somehow, when it got {{so close to the}} time I was to marry him, I couldn't help wishing--well, just thinking about George. Something must have happened to him or he'd have written. On the day he left, he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces. I took one piece and he took the other, and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again.

Ever since I noticed, ten days ago, that little alteration in your manner, I have been afraid you had something on your mind that you were unwilling to confide to me. The very last time <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> I thought you had been crying; and I am sure you looked away uneasily, whenever our eyes met. What is it? Do relieve my anxiety by telling me what it is in your first letter! The moment I get {{to the other side of}} the Channel, I will send you word, where to direct to. I will write constantly--mind you write constantly too. Love me, and remember me always, till I return, never, I hope, to leave you again.--A. C." ...|$|E
6000|$|Though more {{ready to}} listen than to speak, his conversation, {{when he did}} talk, had no trace of {{anything}} the least like insanity about it. He had evidently read, not generally only, but deeply as well, and could apply his reading with singular felicity to the illustration of almost any subject under discussion, neither obtruding his knowledge absurdly, nor concealing it affectedly. His manner was in itself a standing protest against such a nickname as [...] "Mad Monkton." [...] He was so shy, so quiet, so composed and gentle in all his actions, that at times I should have been almost inclined to call him effeminate. We had a long talk together on the first evening of our meeting; <b>we</b> often <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> afterward, and never lost a single opportunity of bettering our acquaintance. I {{felt that he had}} taken a liking to me, and, in spite of what I had heard about his behavior to Miss Elmslie, in spite of the suspicions which the history of his family and his own conduct had arrayed against him, I began to like [...] "Mad Monkton" [...] as much as he liked me. We took many a quiet ride together in the country, and sailed often along the shores of the Bay on either side. But for two eccentricities in his conduct, which I could not at all understand, I should soon have felt as much at my ease in his society {{as if he had been}} my own brother.|$|R
5000|$|At the precinct, detective Hallum {{questions}} a man (Paul Smith), [...] "Don't {{get yourself}} in an uproar, Mr. Cutter, we really don't care why you went there". Cutter {{turns to his}} lawyer (Gary Vinson) and asks, [...] "Do I answer that?" [...] and the lawyer replies, [...] "If you think you can…safely". The exasperated Hallum says to the lawyer, [...] "For crying out loud, Mr. Jonas, you're making this guy sound as guilty as sin. Stop with the cagey act, will you, and explain to your client that unless the coroner declares Brenda Bauer hit herself {{on the head with}} that candlestick five times, we've got a murder case here. He's not a prime suspect. His fingerprints don't match the prints on that candlestick. Now tell him to start talking to me and you stop dancing and maybe we can go home. I'm tired." [...] The diffident Jonas replies, [...] "Well, seems reasonable, but I must insist on protecting my client's best interests". Hallum retorts, [...] "then go out and hire him a lawyer who knows what he's doing. Like I said, I don't care why you went there. I just want to know when you made the appointment and if she said anything to you at all about what she expected to be doing before she met you. Now is that so hard to answer?" [...] Cutter then says, [...] "Well, as a matter of fact, we... we had a standing appointment...uh... every Tuesday at 6:30. <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> any other time, or even talked on the phone.

My dear girl, I have been occupied, since <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> in slightly modifying my old professional habits. I have shifted from Moral Agriculture to Medical Agriculture. Formerly I preyed on the public sympathy, now I prey on the public stomach. Stomach and sympathy, sympathy and stomach--look them both fairly in the face when you reach the wrong side of fifty, and you will agree with me that they come to much the same thing. However that may be, here I am--incredible as it may appear--a man with an income, at last. The founders of my fortune are three in number. Their names are Aloes, Scammony, and Gamboge. In plainer words, I am now living--on a Pill. I made a little money (if you remember) by my friendly connection with you. I made a little more by the happy decease (Requiescat in Pace!) of that female relative of Mrs. Wragge's from whom, as I told you, my wife had expectations. Very good. What do you think I did? I invested the whole of my capital, at one fell swoop, in advertisements, and purchased my drugs and my pill-boxes on credit. The result is now before you. Here I am, a Grand Financial Fact. Here I am, with my clothes positively paid for; with a balance at my banker's; with my servant in livery, and my gig at the door; solvent, flourishing, popular--and all on a Pill." ...|$|R
60|$|Marx {{was much}} more {{advanced}} than I was, as he remains to-day not more advanced but incomparably more learned than I am. I knew then nothing of political economy. I had not yet rid myself of metaphysical abstractions, and my Socialism was only instinctive. He, though younger than I, was already an atheist, an instructed materialist, a well-considered Socialist. It was just {{at this time that}} he elaborated the first foundations of his present system. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> fairly often, for I respected him much for his learning and his passionate and serious devotion (always mixed, however, with personal vanity) to the cause of the proletariat, and I sought eagerly his conversation, which was always instructive and clever, when it was not inspired by a paltry hate, which, alas! happened only too often. But there was never any frank intimacy between as. Our temperaments would not suffer it. He called me a sentimental idealist, and he was right; I called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.|$|E
60|$|There {{was not a}} ship in {{the offing}} save a few small {{coasters}} and little thousand-ton steamers, which were beneath my notice. For several hours I lay submerged with a blank periscope. Then I had an inspiration. Orders had been marconied to every foodship to lie in French waters and dash across after dark. I was as sure of it {{as if they had}} been recorded in our own receiver. Well, if they were there, that was where I should be also. I blew out the tanks and rose, for there was no sign of any warship near. They had some good system of signalling from the shore, however, for I had not got to the North Foreland before three destroyers came foaming after me, all converging from different directions. They had about as good a chance of catching me as three spaniels would have of overtaking a porpoise. Out of pure bravado--I know it was very wrong--I waited until they were actually within gunshot. Then I sank and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> no more.|$|E
60|$|This removal gave Grace and me much pleasure, {{for she was}} as fond of Lucy as I was of Rupert, and, to {{tell the}} truth, so was I, too. Four happier young people {{were not to be}} found in the State than we thus became, each and all of us finding in the {{arrangement}} exactly the association which was most agreeable to our feelings. Previously, we only saw each other every day; now, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> all day. At night we separated at an early hour, it is true, each having his or her room; but it was to meet at a still earlier hour the next morning, and to resume our amusements in company. From study, all of us were relieved for a month or two, and we wandered through the fields; nutted, gathered fruit, or saw others gather it as well as the crops, taking as much exercise as possible in the open air, equally for the good of our bodies, and the lightening of our spirits.|$|E
6000|$|To make a {{long story}} as short as may be, I should say that Allen and I had been acquainted when we were undergraduates; that, when fellows of our {{respective}} colleges, our acquaintance had become intimate; that we had once shared a little bit of fishing on the Test; and that we were both book-collectors. I was a comparatively sane bibliomaniac, but to Allen the time came when he grudged every penny that he did not spend on rare books, and when he actually gave up his share of the water we used to take together, that his contribution to the rent might go for rare editions and bindings. After this deplorable change of character <b>we</b> naturally <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> less, but <b>we</b> were still friendly. I went up to town to scribble; Allen stayed on at Oxford. One day I chanced to go into Blocksby's rooms; it was a Friday, I remember--there was to be a great sale on the Monday. There I met Allen in ecstasies over one of the books displayed in the little side room on the right hand of the sale- room. He had taken out of a glass case and was gloating over a book which, it seems, had long been the Blue Rose of his fancy as a collector. He was crazed about Longepierre, the old French amateur, whose volumes, you may remember, were always bound in blue morocco, and tooled, on the centre and at the corners, with his badge, the Golden Fleece. Now the tome which so fascinated Allen was a Theocritus, published at Rome by Caliergus--a Theocritus on blue paper, if you please, bound in Longepierre's morocco livery, double with red morocco, and, oh ecstasy! with a copy of Longepierre's version of one Idyll on the flyleaf, signed with the translator's initials, and headed [...] "a Mon Roy." [...] It is known to the curious that Louis XIV. particularly admired and praised this little poem, calling it [...] "a model of honourable gallantry." [...] Clearly the grateful author had presented his own copy to the king; and here it was, when king and crown had gone down into dust.|$|R
6000|$|We {{removed to}} Winchester for the {{convenience}} of a library, and find it an exceeding pleasant town, enriched with a beautiful Cathedral, and surrounded by a fresh-looking country. We are in tolerably good and cheap lodgings--Within these two months I have written 1500 lines, most of which, besides many more of prior composition, you will probably see by next winter. I have written 2 tales, one from Boccaccio, called the Pot of Basil, and another called St. Agnes's Eve, on a popular Superstition, and a 3{rd} called Lamia (half finished). I have also been writing parts of my [...] "Hyperion," [...] and completed 4 Acts of a tragedy. It was the opinion of most of my friends that I should never be able to write a scene. I will endeavour to wipe away the prejudice--I sincerely hope you will be pleased when my labours, since <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> shall reach you. One of my Ambitions is to make as great a revolution in modern dramatic writing as Kean has done in acting. Another to upset the drawling of the blue-stocking literary world--if in the Course of a few years I do these two things, I ought to die content, and my friends should drink a dozen of claret on my tomb. I am convinced more and more every day that (excepting the human friend philosopher), a fine writer is the most genuine being in the world. Shakspeare and the Paradise lost every day become greater wonders to me. I look upon fine phrases like a lover. I was glad to see by a passage of one of Brown's letters, some time ago, from the North that you were in such good spirits. Since that you have been married, and in congratulating you I wish you every continuance of them. Present my respects to Mrs. Bailey. This sounds oddly to me, and I daresay I do it awkwardly enough: but I suppose by this time it is nothing new to you. Brown's remembrances to you. As far as I know, we shall remain at Winchester for a goodish while.|$|R
60|$|All {{through that}} summer <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> much of <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> I {{was up at}} the House perhaps every other day; we young people were {{supposed}} to be all in a company together down by the tennis lawns, but indeed we dispersed and came and went by a kind of tacit understanding, Guy and Philip each with one of the Fawney girls and I with Mary. I put all sorts of constructions upon the freedom I was given with her, but I perceive now that we still seemed scarcely more than children to Lady Ladislaw, and that the idea of our marriage was as inconceivable to her as if we had been brother and sister. Matrimonially I was as impossible as one of the stable boys. All the money I could hope to earn for years to come would not have sufficed even to buy Mary clothes. But as yet we thought little of matters so remote, glad in our wonderful new discovery of love, and when at last I went off to Oxford, albeit the parting moved us to much tenderness and vows and embraces, I had no suspicion that never more in all our lives would Mary and I meet freely and gladly without restriction. Yet so it was. From that day came restraints and difficulties; the shadow of furtiveness fell between us; our correspondence had to be concealed.|$|R
