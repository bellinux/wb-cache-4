5000|$|The Enron scandal, {{revealed}} in October 2001, {{eventually led to}} the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, its audit firm. Enron is considered to be the largest bankruptcy reorganization in U.S. history, as well as the biggest audit failure. Executives at Enron used accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and misleading financial reporting to hide billions in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues. The Enron story demonstrated many common features of failed tone at the top, including inappropriate hostility to critics and a misunderstanding of public expectations. In a conference call on April 17, 2001, after Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman complained that Enron wasn't releasing a balance sheet along with its financial statements, then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling responded [...] "Well, thank you very much, <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> ... asshole," [...] a phrase that was met with dismay and astonishment by the media and public, but which became an inside joke among many Enron employees.|$|E

Once again we are sorry that you did not enjoy these episodes."

Enron {{president and chief operating}} officer Jeffrey Skilling began advocating a novel idea: the company didn't really need any [...] "assets". By promoting the company's aggressive investment strategy, he helped make Enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, trading over $27 billion per quarter. The corporation's financial claims, however, had to be accepted at face value. Under Skilling, Enron adopted mark to market accounting, in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if currently real. Thus, Enron could record gains from what over time might turn out to be losses, as the company's fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price on Wall Street during the so-called Tech boom. But when a company's success is measured by undocumented financial statements, actual balance sheets are inconvenient. Indeed, Enron's unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so increase the stock price. An advancing price meant a continued infusion of investor capital on which debt-ridden Enron in large part subsisted (much like a financial [...] "pyramid" [...] or [...] "Ponzi scheme"). Attempting to maintain the illusion, Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street Analyst Richard Grubman, who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference telephone call.
