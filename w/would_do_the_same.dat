5|$|Edwin and Eadbald of Kent were allies at this time, and Edwin {{arranged}} to marry Eadbald's sister Æthelburg. Bede notes that Eadbald {{would agree to}} marry his sister to Edwin only if he converted to Christianity. The marriage of Eadbald's Merovingian mother Bertha had resulted in the conversion of Kent and Æthelburg's <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Using touch controls, {{the player}} would aim {{with one of}} their {{characters}} and shoot them towards enemies like billiards, with the character bouncing off upon contact with enemies or walls until it ran out of momentum. After the player's turn was over, the enemies <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, and attack the player's characters. With {{a certain number of}} turns passed, the player could choose to activate their characters' individual special attacks.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E

5|$|Some {{time after}} his return, and before 293, Diocletian {{transferred}} {{command of the}} war against Carausius from Maximian to Flavius Constantius, a former Governor of Dalmatia and a man of military experience stretching back to Aurelian's campaigns against Zenobia (272–73). He was Maximian's praetorian prefect in Gaul, and the husband to Maximian's daughter, Theodora. On 1 March 293 at Milan, Maximian gave Constantius the office of caesar. In the spring of 293, in either Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) or Sirmium, Diocletian <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for Galerius, husband to Diocletian's daughter Valeria, and perhaps Diocletian's Praetorian Prefect. Constantius was assigned Gaul and Britain. Galerius was initially assigned Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and responsibility for the eastern borderlands.|$|E
5|$|With {{no other}} choices left, Feige {{drew up a}} plan for another offensive. The thinly {{stretched}} forces of the 169th division had to split up {{to take over the}} defense line along the entire frontline between Kayrala and its adjacent lakes. The Finnish 6th Division would then be freed to undertake another massive flanking operation. Coming from the very south, they would circumvent the Soviet positions at Kayrala and thrust to a position east of it behind the Soviet lines at Lake Nurmi. The 169th Division <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but from the north, resulting in a large pincer movement to trap the Soviets. At the beginning of August 1941 this plan was launched with the Finnish 6th Division heading the renewed drive of the XXXVI Corps with the 169th Division following. The plan met with unexpected success. The attack completely surprised the Soviets and a large firefight developed around Kayraly. The German-Finnish force was able to encircle large parts of the Soviet 42nd Rifle Corps and its 104th Division. Although some units escaped, large Soviet formations were subsequently destroyed and the Soviets had to leave most of their equipment behind. In the face of the new German thrust, the Soviets retreated to the Tuutsa River. They tried to establish a new defensive line around Alakurtti, but were unable to hold out against the pursuing Finnish-German units. After the Soviets lost Alakurtti they withdrew to the Voyta River where the old 1939 Soviet border fortifications were situated.|$|E
25|$|As a {{dramatic}} last act, Governor Rockefeller, a longtime death penalty opponent, commuted the sentences of every prisoner on Arkansas's Death Row and urged {{the governors of}} other states to do likewise. Thirty-three years later, in January 2003, Illinois' lame duck governor, George Ryan, <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> granting blanket commutations to the 167 inmates then sentenced to death in that state.|$|E

25|$|In {{his older}} age Pissarro {{suffered}} from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather. As {{a result of this}} disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms. He often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. He moved around northern France and painted from hotels in Rouen, Paris, Le Havre and Dieppe. On his visits to London, he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
25|$|And it is {{occasionally}} visionary, as when Ludlow, {{decades before}} Albert Einstein <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> abandons {{the idea of}} the æther and muses that “e might be allowed to... assert that because our only cognitions of matter are cognitions of force, matter in the scientific sense is force.” He does not elaborate, and evidently the article was altered and cut for publication substantially, so we are left to wonder how far he pursued this idea of the equivalency of matter and energy.|$|E
25|$|FIFA {{reviewed}} {{the possibility of}} increasing Suárez's ban but decided against punishing him for 'unsportsmanlike conduct'. This opened up a discussion on gamesmanship, asking {{the question of whether}} players in that situation should be condemned as a cheat, or applauded for their resourcefulness. One pundit, Paul Fletcher of the BBC, implied that most players <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing in the 'heat of the moment' in order to avoid defeat. Ghana's sports minister, Akua Sena Dansua, called for changes to the rules in such circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Despite her situation, Marie {{wrote letters}} to her school friends pretending {{that she was having}} a happy {{domestic}} life. She also tried to help her husband by writing letters of recommendation for Charles to Paris, where he hoped to raise money. Before he left on a business trip, in December 1839, she made a will bequeathing to her husband her entire inheritance, with the proviso that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for her. This he did, but without her knowledge, he made another will soon after, leaving the Le Glandier property to his mother instead.|$|E

At the news conference announcing Roy's jersey retirement, Roy stated {{that it was time}} for him to move on in regards to what happened in 1995, and that he hoped the Canadiens <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Roy was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2006, his first year of eligibility.|$|E
25|$|On March 7, 1979, the American Film Institute honored Hitchcock {{with its}} Life Achievement Award.

A few years later {{he gave it to}} Bergman, saying that it had given him luck and hoped it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for her.

25|$|Rebel leaders feared mass desertions {{might result}} because of Hamilcar’s policy towards prisoners. To {{forestall}} any such event, rebels committed {{an act of}} cruelty unpardonable by Carthage. Autaritus spread the rumor that Carthaginian prisoners led by Gisco were plotting to escape. Rebels opposing this were stoned and Gisco and his fellow prisoners were tortured to death. Autaritus announced that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> with all Punic prisoners that fell into rebel hands in future. Hamilcar killed his prisoners and announced a policy of equal measure toward future rebel prisoners, thus ending any chance of desertion from the rebel army and the truceless war began in earnest.|$|E
25|$|In 1988–89, Philadelphia {{returned}} to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but was swept {{in the first round}} by the New York Knicks. In 1989–90, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the Sixers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53–29 record. After defeating Cleveland {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In the 1991–92 season, the 76ers went 35–47 and missed the playoffs for the just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1845, he {{accepted}} the presidency of Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. The school had recently been opened by anti-slavery social reformers who sought a Christian utopia. The school was deeply in debt but, thanks to donations by Charles E. Phelps and J. P. Williston, Blanchard was able to secure financial stability. The Old Main building, now recognized as a National Historic Landmark, was constructed during his tenure. When Senator Stephen A. Douglas assisted {{with the passage of}} the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Blanchard harshly criticized him in a newspaper article. He <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> after Douglas' support for the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The two met in Knoxville, Illinois on October 13, 1854 to publicly debate the issues. In 1855, Blanchard went on a lecture circuit of Kentucky with fellow abolitionists Cassius Marcellus Clay and John Gregg Fee.|$|E
