The General Court first authorized colony-wide funding for formal public schooling in 1673, but only the town of Plymouth made use of these funds at that time. By 1683, though, five additional towns had received this funding.|$|E
5|$|Cubes, {{cylinders}} and pimples {{were deployed}} in long rows, often several rows deep, to form anti-tank barriers at beaches and inland.

5|$|Through the 18thand19thcenturies, {{chestnut}} {{in various}} shades was the prevailing colour of Finnish horses, making up about 40-50percent of the breed, and bays, blacks and greys existed in much greater numbers than today: 34percent were bay, 16percent black, {{and the remaining}} 3percent were grey, palomino or spotted. Wide blazes and high leg markings <b>were</b> <b>rare,</b> unlike today; bold markings became common only in the 20thcentury.|$|E
50|$|As a {{quantitative}} example, suppose a collector has 1000 postage stamps, of which 300 are pretty and 100 <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> with 30 being both pretty and rare. 10% {{of all his}} stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> and 10% of his pretty stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> so prettiness tells nothing about rarity. He puts the 370 stamps which <b>are</b> pretty or <b>rare</b> on display. Just over 27% of the stamps on display <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> (100/370), but still only 10% of the pretty stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> (and 100% of the 70 not-pretty stamps on display <b>are</b> <b>rare).</b> If an observer only considers stamps on display, she will observe a spurious negative relationship between prettiness and rarity {{as a result of}} the selection bias (that is, not-prettiness strongly indicates rarity in the display, but not in the total collection).|$|R

5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events <b>were</b> <b>rare,</b> though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, kings {{from all}} the four castes had {{occupied}} the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India. Admitting Kshatriyas to Vedic schools along with Brahmins was customary, but {{the children of the}} Vaishya and Shudra castes were not allowed. Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys, but was relatively frequent among other castes. Intercaste functions <b>were</b> <b>rare</b> and dining together between people of various castes was avoided.|$|E
5|$|Caron and Jackson {{found that}} about 25% of the 172 known species were {{abundant}} and widespread throughout the time {{range of the}} GPB, {{while the majority of}} species <b>were</b> <b>rare,</b> and occurred in a small area {{for a short period of}} time. In most layers the five most abundant species accounted for 50% to 75% of individual animals. The species that had wide ranges in time and space may have been generalists, while the rest were specialists in particular types of environment. Alternatively some wide-ranging species may have been opportunists that were quick to recolonize the area after each burial event. The 6 species that appeared in all layers were very probably generalists.|$|E

5|$|Continuous U.S. {{air support}} for Barrel Roll {{operations}} {{was provided by}} the aircraft of the 602nd and 606th Special Operations Squadrons, elements of the 56th Air Commando Wing (as of 8 April 1967 the 56th Special Operations Wing), based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. On 25 October 1967, they were joined by the 22nd Special Operations Squadron. Pre-planned airstrikes in the Barrel Roll area <b>were</b> <b>rare.</b> Until 1968, most U.S. jet fighter-bomber sorties only occurred when aircraft were returning to Thailand from Rolling Thunder missions carrying unexpended ordnance loads. They would then be directed to targets in northeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts <b>were</b> <b>rare,</b> even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Blamey was transferred to the War Office, where he worked in the Intelligence Branch preparing daily summaries for the King and the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener. Fully trained staff officers <b>were</b> <b>rare</b> and valuable in the Australian Army, and while still in Britain, Blamey was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as general staff officer, Grade 3 (Intelligence), on the staff of Major General William Bridges's 1st Division. As such, he reported to the 1st Division's GSO1, Lieutenant Colonel Brudenell White. In November 1914 he sailed for Egypt with Colonel Harry Chauvel, to join the Australian contingent there.|$|E

5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases <b>were</b> <b>rare.</b> Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|IGN {{said that}} the {{difference}} between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class. IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting rather than their quality, while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and <b>were</b> <b>rare</b> enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers said that many of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.|$|E
5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and {{much of their time}} was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books <b>were</b> <b>rare</b> and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E

5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions <b>were</b> <b>rare</b> because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E

An unusual mass escape occurred in September 1964 when 14East Germans, including 11 children, were smuggled across the border in a refrigerated truck. They were able to escape detection by being concealed under the carcasses of slaughtered pigs being transported to the West.|$|E
5|$|The Arthurian legends contain {{numerous}} {{instances of}} red knights, black knights or green knights challenging {{the knights of}} the Round Table.
