40|$|This study {{addresses}} the research question: ‘What are the diffusion determinants for extreme weather-proofing {{technology in the}} Australian built environment?’ In order to effectively identify diffusion determinants, a synthesis of literature in both technical and management fields was conducted from a system-wide perspective. Review results where then interpreted through an innovation system framework, drawn from innovation systems literature, in order to map {{the current state of}} extreme weather-proofing technology diffusion in the Australian built environment industry. Drivers and obstacles to optimal diffusion are presented. Results show the important role to be played by Australian governments in facilitating improved <b>weather</b> <b>proofing</b> technology diffusion. This applies to governments in their various roles, but particularly as regulators, clients/owners and investors in research & development and education. In the role as regulators, findings suggest Australian governments should be encouraging the application of innovative finance options and positive end-user incentives to promote the uptake of <b>weather</b> <b>proofing</b> technology. Additionally, in their role as clients/owners, diffusion can be improved by adjusting building and infrastructure specifications to encourage designers and constructors to incorporate extreme <b>weather</b> <b>proofing</b> technology in new and redeveloped built assets. Finally, results suggest greater investment is required in research and development and improved knowledge sharing across the construction supply chain to further mitigate risks associated with greater incidences of extreme weather events. ...|$|R

60|$|The policy (as {{who should}} say the park) was of some extent, but very ill reclaimed; heather and moor-fowl {{had crossed the}} {{boundary}} wall and spread and roosted within; {{and it would have}} tasked a landscape gardener to say where policy ended and unpolicied nature began. My lord had been led by the influence of Mr. Sheriff Scott into a considerable design of planting; many acres were accordingly set out with fir, and the little feathery besoms gave a false scale and lent a strange air of a toy-shop to the moors. A great, rooty sweetness of bogs was in the air, and at all seasons an infinite melancholy piping of hill birds. Standing so high and with so little shelter, it was a cold, exposed house, splashed by showers, drenched by continuous rains that made the gutters to spout, beaten upon and buffeted by all the winds of heaven; and the prospect would be often black with tempest, and often white with the snows of winter. But the house was wind and <b>weather</b> <b>proof,</b> the hearths were kept bright, and the rooms pleasant with live fires of peat; and Archie might sit of an evening and hear the squalls bugle on the moorland, and watch the fire prosper in the earthy fuel, and the smoke winding up the chimney, and drink deep of the pleasures of shelter.|$|E
60|$|There is, let us say, {{a certain}} filthy rookery in Hoxton, {{dripping}} with disease and honeycombed with crime and promiscuity. There are, let us say, two noble and courageous young men, of pure intentions and (if you prefer it) noble birth; let us call them Hudge and Gudge. Hudge, let us say, is of a bustling sort; {{he points out}} that the people must at all costs be got out of this den; he subscribes and collects money, but he finds (despite the large financial interests of the Hudges) that the thing will have to be done on the cheap {{if it is to be}} done on the spot. He therefore, runs up a row of tall bare tenements like beehives; and soon has all the poor people bundled into their little brick cells, which are certainly better than their old quarters, in so far as they are <b>weather</b> <b>proof,</b> well ventilated and supplied with clean water. But Gudge has a more delicate nature. He feels a nameless something lacking in the little brick boxes; he raises numberless objections; he even assails the celebrated Hudge Report, with the Gudge Minority Report; and by the end of a year or so has come to telling Hudge heatedly that the people were much happier where they were before. As the people preserve in both places precisely the same air of dazed amiability, it is very difficult to find out which is right. But at least one might safely say that no people ever liked stench or starvation as such, but only some peculiar pleasures en tangled with them. Not so feels the sensitive Gudge. Long before the final quarrel (Hudge v. Gudge and Another), Gudge has succeeded in persuading himself that slums and stinks are really very nice things; that the habit of sleeping fourteen in a room is what has made our England great; and that the smell of open drains is absolutely essential to the rearing of a viking breed.|$|E

40|$|This report {{recommends}} {{the federal government}} implements a national energy efficiency program for 3. 5 million low-income households {{over the next seven}} years. Although the government has committed to CPI indexation and cash assistance, cash assistant alone does not represent the best long-term solution for low-income households and government. The program would involve a home visit that would determine the most appropriate package of energy efficiency measures for each household. Each household would receive energy efficiency improvements up to the value of $ 2, 000 (including the cost of the visit). The energy efficiency improvements may include, compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) light bulbs, efficient shower roses, <b>weather</b> <b>proofing,</b> curtains, ceiling insulation and efficient refrigerators. Some households with special circumstances that need energy efficient water heating or air-conditioning may receive a grant of up to $ 6, 000. This report finds that the costs of energy will rise substantially even without the introduction of the CPRS. An improvement in energy efficiency provides an opportunity for an effective demand side response by households that can shield households from the impact of rising energy costs through a reduction of energy consumption...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} five years caravan {{manufacturers}} have dramatically changed their approach to the design, construction and manufacture of their products. What was a very traditional cottage industry has now become a hi-tech and extremely competitive sector driven by lean manufacturing processes. This investment into new technologies has {{led to the development of}} a product that now offers improved build quality, enhanced structural rigidity, reduced water ingress and improved thermal insulation. The majority of investment over this period has been into the body shell of the caravan and despite the advances in the development of the sides and roof panels, the caravan floor, chassis and suspension are still constructed using materials and components that have altered little in the last thirty years. It is believed that the current chassis and suspension system is inadequate in terms of isolation from road imperfections, structural performance, weight, <b>weather</b> <b>proofing</b> and cost. It was the intention of this project to investigate how this substructure could be redesigned to match the performance characteristics of the rest of the caravan. This thesis outlines the investigation and product development process and proposes a new design for a lightweight caravan chassis and suspension system that provides improved chassis isolation from the road in a package that is 150 kg lighter, of comparable stiffness and manufacturing cost...|$|R
30|$|As already {{mentioned}} {{in a lot}} of instances, the [1] report estimates that around 40 % of the world’s final energy is used for residential buildings. The building sector plays a large role in the energy consumption which includes space heating or cooling, domestic hot water and electricity. Buildings with their long lifespan and huge amount of already existing buildings, makes revision in energy characteristics of a building constrained. In many countries, new buildings could be made 70 % more efficient than existing buildings [2]. According to [3], the annual rate of new building construction is always higher than the demolition rate. In contrary to the energy policies’ aims of reducing the energy consumption, the energy demand in residential sector has increased by 15 % in the last decade in UK [4]. Global energy consumption in the residential sector grows on average at 1 % per year [2]. Energy use in the buildings sector follows a trend which increases it by 88 % between 2003 and 2050, or 1.4 % per year [2]. A whopping 50 % of residential sector demand is used for space heating in IEA countries and this is expected to be around 70 % for countries such as Germany and Poland [1]. The second major energy demand for residential sector is the electricity. Electricity consumption increases at 2.5 % per year, raising its share in the buildings sector from 24 % in 2003 to estimated 40 % in 2050 [2, p. 200]. Half of all energy saving potential in the residential sector could be from space heating [2]. Water heating also accounts for about 16 % of total energy savings in the future [2]. Accordingly, the most effective energy conservation measures are the insulation of external walls (33 – 60 % energy savings), <b>weather</b> <b>proofing</b> of openings (16 – 21 %), the installation of double-glazed windows (14 – 20 %), the regular maintenance of central heating boilers (10 – 12 %), and the installation of solar collectors for sanitary hot water production (50 – 80 %) [5].|$|R
