500|$|The {{first line}} of the third verse allude to a {{definitive}} moment with the cryptic reference to God: [...] "Now <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> it out, I'm worse than you/Yeah, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> it out I wanted to/Now, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> out where to draw the line/Your guess {{is as good as}} mine." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric [...] "God gave you style and gave you grace," [...] Martin sings as if [...] "cataloguing the attributes he only wishes he had". When the song is performed live, guitarist Jonny Buckland begins a long ripping off guitar riff while Chris Martin plays an acoustic guitar.|$|E
500|$|... "Sleeping {{with the}} One I Love" [...] was written and {{produced}} by R. Kelly. During {{the early stages}} of production for The Definition Of..., Fantasia posted several videos on her social media accounts of her recording sessions with Kelly. In promotional interviews, Fantasia said that the album was initially produced by another artist who she “really, really, really loved", but she switched to a different team for the final product. She explained: [...] "Sometimes, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> with producers who are artists, it’s very hard, They are doing their thing … and things got a little chaotic.” Derrick G. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times speculated that Kelly was the producer mentioned by Fantasia.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't then," [...] said Felicity decidedly. [...] "And {{you need}} never be dull <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>work</b> to do. 'Satan finds some {{mischief}} still for idle hands to do!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> do your <b>work</b> tasks thoroughly, <b>you</b> receive {{complaints}} {{for being}} too slow. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> do them efficiently, you're critiqued for being sloppy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hol' your tongue, sar! What {{you go on}} jabberin' so to me <b>when</b> <b>you's</b> got <b>work</b> to do, sar!" [...] said Peter fiercely, with a {{threatening}} motion of his fist. [...] "Go to <b>work</b> at once, <b>you</b> white slabe!" ...|$|R
500|$|However, Canham later {{denied that}} Elliott was [...] "eased out" [...] of his job. [...] In an {{interview}} with Joe Falls, Canham said: [...] "Bump and I are close personal friends. [...] Bump is not naïve – he knows that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> at a place for 10 years and you’re not winning consistently, it doesn’t become fun for anybody – the coach, the alumni, the players or anybody else. [...] We talked about this {{and we talked about}} it openly. [...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him. [...] I mean that. [...] I didn’t fire Bump Elliott. [...] My first year as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record. [...] Anyone could live with that." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Rob Sheffield wrote: [...] "'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' is the slinkiest and best thing Coldplay have ever done." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Buckland's lead fills highlight the wondrous 'God Put a Smile on Your Face', as the song's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen Doves." [...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> it out I'm the same as you....your guess is as good as mine.'" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why, unless you're forced. The only object {{for working}} is <b>when</b> <b>you</b> must <b>work</b> to live, and it isn't mine, because I can't live on my pay. In fact, the {{futility}} of the thing is plain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you remember," [...] he said, halting {{in front}} of her, [...] "what <b>you</b> were <b>when</b> I married <b>you?</b> <b>Working</b> at {{accounts}} in a restaurant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now is {{the time}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> must <b>work</b> lively, lads, {{in order to get}} all the grain aboard if it be possible! We have a good hour before us, {{according}} to the way yonder craft is sailing, and should be able to clean up all that John Weston has made ready for us." ...|$|R
500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 June 2012, Smith {{spoke to}} Music Week about Glassheart being {{released}} on 26 November 2012. Scrapping {{many of the}} earlier recorded tracks (see recording sessions), Smith said he was [...] "taking a production role for the whole album as well as co-authoring about half its tracks". Lewis would later talk of the album's delay and Smith's involvement, describing the original release dates as rough guides. Following Lewis' performance at BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Smith revealed that the album was 80% complete, [...] "We've got the key tracks and we're very close." [...] Describing the process as {{a stark contrast to}} previous albums Spirit and Echo, Smith said that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> with many producers [...] "you end up with maybe two or three radio songs and not necessarily the album sales you want." [...] Lewis spoke to reporters back stage after the performance, revealing that the album had been brought forward a month to October 2012. By the time July had come around, Smith updated fans to say that the album was now 97% complete.|$|E
2500|$|Kirchner {{was then}} {{admitted}} to The Bellevue Sanatorium, run by Ludwig Binswanger, in Kreuzlingen where {{he continued to}} produce paintings and woodcuts. In 1918, Kirchner was given a residence permit and he moved to [...] "In den Lärchen" [...] in Frauenkirch Davos where he rented a room {{on the first floor}} and eventually the above rooms in 1919, which he decorated with furniture that he carved. He wrote of the house to Henry van de Velde: [...] "I’m living in a beautiful old Grisons house with a kitchen that looks like Rembrandt’s studio". Kirchner overcame his illness and, although he was still dependent on morphine, his doctor was slowly decreasing his doses. He also writes [...] "A Painter's Credo" [...] where he states: [...] "There is an intellectual guardianship over the world, it is man…. This is the last judgement, before them you stand….. They help you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work.</b> You can thank them only through work. When you want to die, they sometimes appear to you. When you are completely empty and completely open, you belong to them". Erna Schilling, his life partner, visited him periodically in Frauenkirch, while also maintaining a residence in Berlin to take care of Kirchner's business there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, there is," [...] I {{answered}} sharply. [...] "You {{can save}} your heads so that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> return to <b>work</b> there will be enough of you left to do the work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"What {{else did}} you expect?" [...] I said. [...] "That was the one time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> might have <b>worked</b> one of your charms, instead of running into three times your weight." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Mercury actor Norman Lloyd (who {{is portrayed}} by Leo Bill in the film) praised Christian McKay's {{performance}} as Orson Welles as [...] "the best rendition of him I've ever seen." [...] However, he otherwise [...] "hated" [...] {{the film and}} he criticized {{the accuracy of the}} characters: [...] "It bears no relation to truth, or to what happened <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> with Orson and so forth. I thought McKay was very good, {{but the rest of the}} characters are just ridiculous. They're all made up! I didn't even recognize myself… and then I thought, “Well, thank goodness I can't!” (...) And about George Coulouris, that they had him as neurotic and afraid to do his scene. George Coulouris you couldn't stop from acting, for Christ's sake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, young philosopher, pile up your berries in {{that green}} platter while I repair the basket. Bear {{this in mind}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> in bark: make your handle {{the way of the}} grain, and choose a strip both smooth and broad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's an altruistic {{theory that}} the dollars don't count; but it's easier to believe when you draw your wages regularly, and I've known it break down when an {{engineer}} was offered a more lucrative post. Anyhow, I reckon it's our business to make good, even if our pay isn't equal to our desserts, which happens pretty often <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> on the railroad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First spoil {{in my new}} life," [...] he went on {{with harsh}} joviality. [...] "The dodge of {{carrying}} it down there I learned later. I carried it stuck in my belt that day. No, I hadn't much stomach for the job; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> with a gentleman of the real right sort you may depend on your feelings being seen through your skin. Says the governor suddenly: ...|$|E
6000|$|He laughed. [...] "You {{will find}} all your pet reforms depend upon it, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to <b>work</b> them out," [...] he said. [...] "You can't {{have a minimum}} wage without a minimum price." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The salary," [...] Elizabeth explained, [...] "is twenty-five {{dollars a}} week. The hours are nine to six. You {{have quite a}} {{comfortable}} room there, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have private <b>work</b> connected with the theatre you can bring it home if you wish. Mr. Ware tells me that <b>you</b> <b>work</b> very quickly. <b>You</b> will finish all that you have for him to-day, won't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Coppola uses a {{different}} process {{when she is}} songwriting for herself from when she is songwriting for another artist or writing on speculation. She says, [...] "My brain changes, my thought processes, my body language changes, the way I <b>work</b> changes....; <b>When</b> <b>you</b> do <b>work</b> for other artists, it’s definitely more of a job and it {{requires a lot of}} tools." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was nothing}} more hateful to Albinia than dawdling. She left the girls' choice of employments, but insisted on their being veritably occupied, and many a time did she {{encounter}} a killing glance from Sophia for attacking her listless, moody position in her chair, or saying, in clear, alert tones, 'My dear, when you read, read, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work,</b> work. When you fix your eye in that way, you are doing neither.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, godmother. It cheers me to {{hear you}} say so. But you see it is so hard to bring up a child well, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work,</b> work, work, all day. When he was out of employment, I couldn't always keep him near me. He got fractious and nervous, and I was obliged to let him go into the streets. And he never did well in the streets, he never did well out of sight. How often it happens with children!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Aaron. [...] "But there's soon a {{limit to}} what I can earn.--It's like this. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> it out, {{everything}} comes to money. Reckon it as you like, it's money on both sides. It's money we live for, and money is what our lives is worth--nothing else. Money we live for, and money we are when we're dead: that or nothing. An' it's money as is between the masters and us. There's a few educated ones got hold of {{one end of the}} rope, and all the lot of us hanging on to th' other end, an' we s'll go on pulling our guts out, time in, time out--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you can {{be painted}} by five hundred <b>when</b> <b>you</b> aren't at <b>work,</b> of course. But while <b>you</b> are at <b>work</b> you'll <b>work.</b> <b>You</b> won't half-stop and think and talk about rare plants and dicky-birds and farinaceous {{fiduciary}} interests. You'll continue to revolve, and this new head of water will see that you do so continue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad {{you like}} it, dear. But it ain't all fun, as you'll find out to-morrow <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go to <b>work,</b> for Sophie says you must," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Basset, as her guests trooped away, rashly promising to like everything.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘So she said. She {{said you}} never tired; or never owned that you tired. Not {{all the time}} you lived together. Not even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> fainted, between <b>work</b> and fasting. But I told you that, the last time I came.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Next week we {{will hold}} our feast {{to give thanks}} for the good things the earth has given to us, and after we have councilled {{together}} we will feast and have a dance. Let everything be in order. Come in your finest dress. Let every garment be as it was of old. Let the young girls be very beautiful in whitened buckskin and beads. I do not despise your old-time dress; I like it. Hereafter, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> {{you will need to}} wear white man's clothes, for they are more comfortable; but when you wish to have a good time, then your old dress will be pleasant. I do not ask you to forget the old time. It is past, but it is sweet to you. I want you to be happy, for I am happy." ...|$|E
