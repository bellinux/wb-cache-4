40|$|Making smart savings choices is {{critical}} to ensuring Canadians have access to sufficient and secure post-retirement incomes. Except for the working poor, Canadians must save a very high fraction of pre-retirement earnings every year – either through employer plans or private saving – to provide for reasonably adequate and assured retirement incomes. We estimate that most Canadians, should they wish to retire at age 65 and replace 70 percent of their <b>working</b> <b>incomes,</b> will need to save from 10 to 21 percent of their pre-tax earnings every year, if they save for 35 years. Although private retirement savings allow choice about retirement age and income, Income Tax Act limits on tax-recognized savings would prevent many earners from accumulating sufficient RRSP savings over 33 years (by age 63) to securely replace 70 {{percent or more of}} their <b>working</b> <b>incomes.</b> The authors are grateful {{to the members of the}} Pension Series Advisory Group of the C.

40|$|In {{bringing}} down the 2007 Budget, the Finance Minister wanted all {{to know that he}} had listened to Canadians. He had talked to ordinary people on the streets. He sat down with folks in coffee shops across the country. He crafted the federal Budget {{on the basis of these}} conversations. In our view, the resulting ‘coffee shop ’ Budget offers up a mixed brew. There are several positive measures. Two are of particular note: The <b>Working</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Benefit (WITB) will offer help (though meagre) to the poorest of working poor Canadians struggling with the daily grind, and there will be a new savings vehicle for persons with severe disabilities. Neither provides a comprehensive solution to the problem it addresses, but they are an important start. The <b>Working</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Benefit will be small to start but sets a foundation on which future budgets can build. The Disability Savings Plan is one of a set of measures needed to tackle the poverty in which many Canadians with disabilities are trapped – measures that must include both investments in better income security programs and a concerted focus on disability supports. Other provisions of the Budget, however, are a large double double dose of unfocused spending. The ‘new ’ child tax credit − in reality an obsolete program resurrected from the 1980 s − tops this list.

In addition, a stepwise multiple regression analysis identified time for leisure social activi-ties as a determining factor in suicide rate, even after adjusting for <b>working</b> hours and <b>income.</b> How-ever, the impact of time for leisure social activities on suicide rate was smaller than that of <b>working</b> hours and <b>income.</b> In contrast, none of these factors affected suicide rate in women.

30|$|In {{this study}} we {{assess the impact of}} the <b>Working</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Benefit (WITB) on labour supply, GDP and income {{distribution}} in Canada, using a general equilibrium microsimulation model. We also estimate labour supply and demand elasticities using survey data to ensure that households’ behaviour is properly captured in the model. Simulation results show that the WITB affects particularly labour market participation of low- and medium-skilled lone-parents families. These positive effects on labour supply translate into higher after-tax incomes leading to a decline in low-income rates and low-income gaps. Our findings suggest that enhancing the WITB could provide additional income support to working Canadian families while reducing work disincentives for those trapped behind the welfare wall.|$|E

Because the study participants were volunteers rather than randomly selected, conclusions drawn from these findings necessarily have limitations.

40|$|Accepted {{international}} {{assessments of}} living standards in retirement rely on comparisons of pension incomes (OECD, 2005). These assessments conclude that European countries with long standing contributory national pension schemes, which relate retirement incomes to previous earned incomes, provide retirees with much higher living standards than liberal Anglo {{countries in which}} many citizens rely on flat-rate old age pensions. The OECD, in particular, is critical of the low replacement rates (ratio of retirement to <b>working</b> <b>income)</b> and low ‘adequacy ’ of retirement incomes in the liberal Anglo democracies. Comparisons based on pension incomes are potentially misleading because the living standards of retirees depend on their total economic resources, and particularly their total wealth (net worth), not just on pension incomes. The political economies of different countries, especially their tax and pension regimes, offer quite different opportunities for wealth accumulation. Other things equal, high contributions to national pension schemes impose significant opportunity costs. They reduce opportunities to accumulate wealth via home ownership and household savings...|$|E

To the extent that better health yields a pay-off in terms of higher income, efforts on the part of governments to promote good health may also contribute to increasing the rate of economic growth. This paper examines the relationships between health status and economic output, focusing primarily on women. The data are drawn from a longitudinal household survey conducted in Indonesia, the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). Four dimensions of labor market performance are examined: the decision to work, hours spent <b>working,</b> <b>income</b> earned from the prior year and hourly earnings from work. We adopt two complementary empirical strategies to address the empirical concerns of reverse causality and measurement error, and we show that conclusions about whether health does affect labor outcomes are very sensitive to these concerns. On balance, we believe that the evidence points to a causal effect of women’s weight on earnings and that labor supply is curtailed among women who have difficulties with physical activities like walking a long distance and carrying a heavy load. 1...|$|E

30|$|Respondents’ {{first job}} and present job cover a large span, with the longest {{interval}} being 53  years. Using direct difference in incomes from different years is obviously inappropriate, because various {{factors such as}} inflation must be taken into account. Therefore, we computerize the consumer price index (CPI) coefficient for each year, with 1951 as the base year (the CPI on 1951 is set as 100). To be precise, the year that corresponds to income for first job is set as the last year of this first job. In the case the respondent never changed jobs and has retired, the corresponding year is set as the year of retirement. If he/she has neither changed jobs nor retired, the corresponding year is set to 2008 (because the data was collected in 2009). The corresponding year for respondents who changed jobs {{for the first time in}} 2009 is still set as 2008. For present job, which refers to those who are <b>working,</b> <b>income</b> corresponds to income for 2008; but if the respondent has retired, the corresponding year should be set as the year when they left or retired. Similarly, the year corresponding to respondents whose departure or retirement occurred in 2009 is also set as 2008. In this manner, after converting each sample, comparable income with a benchmark of 1951 is acquired. Finally, due to income skewness, logarithm transformations are conducted for relevant incomes.|$|E
