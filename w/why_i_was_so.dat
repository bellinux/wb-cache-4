2500|$|In April 2004, Moulitsas and Daily Kos {{became the}} focus of {{controversy}} over a statement that he posted in the comments section of a blog post about Blackwater USA employees who were killed and mutilated in Fallujah:"Let the people see what war is like. This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave {{men and women in uniform}} make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay. I was angry that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition [...] So I struck back." ...|$|E
