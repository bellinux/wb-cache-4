500|$|In March 1968, Irvine {{signed for}} Preston North End, who were {{struggling}} {{at the bottom}} of the Football League Second Division, for a transfer fee of £45,000 and a signing-on fee of £5,000. He was one of five Burnley first-team players to leave the club during that year. Irvine made his debut for Preston North End on 14 March 1968 in the 0–4 defeat away at Ipswich Town. He scored his first goal for the club in the following match, a 2–1 win against Aston Villa at Deepdale. The team subsequently went on a run of eight games without defeat in the league, including a 3–1 win over Huddersfield Town in which Irvine scored a hat-trick. On the morning of 27 April 1968, the Preston North End team were each offered £2,500 to purposely lose the match against Bristol City in order that Bristol City could improve their chances of avoiding relegation. Irvine, along with teammate Derek Temple, refused, saying: [...] "I'm a professional. I <b>want</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this". Irvine scored the team's only goal in a 1–4 defeat that day, and by the end of the 1967–68 season he had scored six times in eleven matches for his new side. He carried his goalscoring form into the new campaign, scoring the winner against Oldham Athletic in the first round of the League Cup, and netting a consolation goal in the 1–3 defeat to Crystal Palace.|$|E

[...] The Futurists admired speed, technology, youth and violence, the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature, and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated {{the cult of the}} past and all imitation, praised originality, [...] "however daring, however violent", bore proudly [...] "the smear of madness", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.|$|E

2500|$|The American {{journalist}} and former Nixon speechwriter William Safire {{wrote that the}} term fulfilled {{a need for a}} term to distinguish traditional Islam from terrorists: [...] "Islamofascism may have legs: the compound defines those terrorists who profess a religious mission while embracing totalitarian methods and helps separate them from devout Muslims who <b>want</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> terrorist means." [...] Eric Margolis denied any resemblance between anything in the Muslim world, with its local loyalties and consensus decision-making and the historic, corporative-industrial states of the West. [...] "The Muslim World", he argued, [...] "is replete with brutal dictatorships, feudal monarchies, and corrupt military-run states, but none of these regimes, however deplorable, fits the standard definition of fascism. Most, in fact, are America's allies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} noted screen portrayals of Brown {{have both been}} given by actor Raymond Massey. The 1940 film Santa Fe Trail, {{starring}} Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, depicted Brown completely unsympathetically as an out-and-out villainous madman; Massey added to that impression by playing him with a constant, wild-eyed stare. The film gave the impression {{that it did not}} oppose slavery, {{even to the point of}} having a Black [...] "mammy" [...] character say, after an especially fierce battle, [...] "Mr. Brown done promised us freedom, but... if this is freedom, I don't <b>want</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it". Massey portrayed Brown again in the little-known, low-budget Seven Angry Men, in which he was not only the main character, but depicted in a much more restrained, sympathetic way. Massey along with Tyrone Power and Judith Anderson starred in the acclaimed 1953 dramatic reading of Stephen Vincent Benet's epic Pulitzer Prize-winning poem John Brown's Body(1928). Three actors in formal dress recited and acted in a two-hour presentation of the poem. The production toured 60 cities in 28 states.|$|E
