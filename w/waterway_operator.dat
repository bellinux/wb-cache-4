50|$|The 1993 Big Bayou Canot {{train wreck}} of September 22, 1993 {{was the worst}} train wreck {{in the history of}} the United States {{passenger}} railroad company Amtrak. Investigation of this accident produced recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board, the United States National Academy of Science, and the American <b>Waterway</b> <b>Operators</b> that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers support production of low cost electronic navigation for the Inland River System. This recommendation was followed by Congress directing and funding the Corps to develop and publish electronic chart data for the inland waterways. The Corps began with pilot projects for the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana and for the lower Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the Michigan lawsuit, on January 5, 2010, Illinois State Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a counter-suit with the Supreme Court requesting that it reject Michigan's claims. Siding with the State of Illinois, both the Illinois Chamber of Commerce and the American <b>Waterways</b> <b>Operators</b> have filed affidavits, arguing that closing the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal would upset the movement of {{millions of tons of}} vital shipments of iron ore, coal, grain and other cargo, totaling more than $1.5 billion a year, and contribute to the loss of hundreds, perhaps thousands of jobs. However, Michigan along with several other Great Lakes states argue that the sport and commercial fishery and tourism associated with the fishery of the entire Great Lakes region is estimated at $7 billion a year, and impacts the economies of all Great Lakes states and Canada.|$|R
40|$|Waterborne {{multimodal}} {{transportation is}} becoming an increasingly {{important part of the}} logistics chain given its comparatively low pollution levels when compared to other transportation methods. Analysis of the increased traffic flows on rivers and canals indicates, however, that locks will soon become a major bottleneck for inland waterway transportation. Inland <b>waterway</b> <b>operators</b> are thus facing the significant challenge of scheduling their waterway's series of locks {{in such a way that}} the transit time of ships traversing the waterway is minimized. The serial Lock Scheduling Problem (sLSP) is the combinatorial optimization problem corresponding to this increasingly difficult challenge for inland <b>waterway</b> <b>operators.</b> A combinatorial Benders' decomposition for the single-chamber serial lock scheduling problem is presented. This approach enables a straightforward transition from fixed/infinite capacity models to those with traffic-dependent lock capacity at little to no additional computational cost. The presented decomposition approach considers the original fixed/infinite capacity model as the Master Problem and evaluates the traffic dependent capacity constraints in a sub problem. By adding combinatorial Benders' cuts to the Master Problem before and during the solution process, it quickly converges to a feasible and optimal traffic dependent capacity sLSP solution. The method's performance is evaluated on a large set of small to medium sized instances, analysing the influence of traffic dependent lock capacities on both the ship waiting time and total computation time. The results demonstrate how the total required computation time of both models are within the same interval, thus highlighting the efficiency of the presented decomposition approach. For larger lock capacities, the decomposition approach is consistently faster than its fixed capacity counterpart. Furthermore, the results reveal significant differences in ship waiting times between fixed/infinite and traffic dependent models on the instances with real-life ship sizes. These results indicate that traffic dependent lock capacity is a prerequisite for an accurate prediction of ship waiting times in realistic scenarios where ships of different sizes are handled by the lock. status: publishe...|$|R

In response, Michigan noted the value of the sport fishing and recreation industry, already heavily affected in other states with large carp populations, would drop by more than $3.0 billion and result in the loss of at least 4,000 jobs. President Obama and his administration supported Illinois's efforts to keep the canal open; with the support of USGS and USFWS, reports have consistently denied the Asian carp poses a threat.|$|R
40|$|The Lock Scheduling Problem (LSP) is a {{combinatorial}} optimization problem {{that represents a}} real challenge for many harbours and <b>waterway</b> <b>operators.</b> The LSP consists of three strongly interconnected sub problems: scheduling lockages, assigning ships to chambers, and positioning the ships inside the chambers. These should be interpreted respectively as a scheduling, an assignment, and a packing problem. By combining the first two problems into a master problem and using the packing problem as a sub problem, a decomposition is achieved that can be solved efficiently by a Combinatorial Benders' approach. The master problem is solved first, thereby sequencing the ships {{into a number of}} lockages. Next, for each lockage, a packing sub problem is checked for feasibility, possibly returning a number of combinatorial inequalities (cuts) to the master problem. The result is an exact approach to the LSP. Experiments are conducted on a set of instances that were generated in correspondence with real world data. The results indicate that the decomposition approach significantly outperforms other exact approaches presented in the literature, in terms of solution quality and computation time. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Low {{transport}} costs help sales and procurement markets to expand. Enlarging those markets allows exploiting economies of scale, an advantage that {{also applies to}} small businesses which focus on the large-scale production of single components and special products. In the past, vertical division of labour encouraged the development of supply networks, which in recent decades benefited road transport of goods. Lower {{transport costs}} promote not just vertical division of labour but also the development of spatial agglomerations. The transport costs burdening an economy depend essentially on its geographical location and transport situation. Locations at sea ports enjoy a cost-effective edge {{when it comes to}} direct overseas links. Ocean-going ships, inland <b>waterway</b> <b>operators,</b> railways and lorry transport have relative shipping rates vis-à-vis each other of 1 : 10 : 17. 5 : 25. Transporting a container across 9, 000 km from Rotterdam to New York costs 25 percent less than transporting it across 1, 200 km from Rotterdam to Vienna using the Rhine-Main-Danube waterway. Liberalisation of international goods transport in the course of creating the EU single market accelerated competition within the transport industry. This in turn promoted progress and ensured rapid implementation and utilisation of rationalisation potentials. Over the past 15 years, shipping rates declined compared to goods prices. The decline was particularly sharp in air freight rates. The Schengen Agreement facilitated cross-border goods transport by road within the EU. By doing away with the many hours of waiting at borders, it generated a productivity leap for road transporters. The railways lost their price lead in overland transport already back in the 1970 s and have been forced to align their prices to road transport rates. Since the late 1980 s, transport policies have been increasingly reflecting environmental concerns. Infrastructure expansions are made with a view to improving the rail system so as to strengthen the more "environmentally friendly" rail transport against road transport. In Austria, investment into federal roads has been showing a trend towards decline since 1983, even though road traffic as such continues to grow. Since 1988, more investment has been directed towards the rail than the road. If these trends in road building and traffic flows continue, bottlenecks in road transport will necessarily build up, which in turn would mean substantial cost increases for goods transport by road. By its transport policy, the European Union wants to internalise the external costs of traffic. Such a course would make goods transport by road significantly more expensive. Exporters in land-locked countries would find their competitiveness increasingly dependent on the supply of rail transport. If the quality and productivity of rail transport cannot be improved accordingly, inland production facilities would lose ground in competing against plants in the proximity of sea ports.
