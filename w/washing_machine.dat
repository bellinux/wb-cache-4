5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip the <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> but {{fail to do}} so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that something has indeed happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the <b>washing</b> <b>machine,</b> Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a cropped Polaroid photograph of two unidentified fans taken at a Sonic Youth show in Amherst, Massachusetts in April 1995, during a short tour undertaken while the album was still in production. The fans are depicted wearing T-shirts that were sold as merchandise during that tour; early in 1995, the band was toying {{with the idea of}} changing their name to <b>Washing</b> <b>Machine.</b> Visible on the shirt on the left are signatures by Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw of the tour's opening band Come. The photo was taken by Gordon, who believed it could be used as the album cover. The band liked the shot, but the record label did not want to use it without permission from the fans. As the band did not have any way to contact them, their faces had to be cropped out.|$|E

5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the <b>washing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave.

Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Washing</b> <b>machines</b> perform several rinses {{after the}} main wash to remove {{most of the}} detergent. Modern <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> use less water due to {{environmental}} concerns; however, {{this has led to}} the problem of poor rinsing on many <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> on the market, which can be a problem to people who are sensitive to detergents. The Allergy UK website suggests re-running the rinse cycle, or rerunning the entire wash cycle without detergent.|$|R

25|$|Result: Platinum {{ended up}} with an {{umbrella}} that doubled up as a seat, and a cardboard toilet. Odyssey also wanted the toilet, but lost out due to Steven and Lucy spending their entire pitch haggling on the price and showing no real enthusiasm for the product.

It aims to address relevant topics in terms of material efficiency, such as durability, reusability and reparability, for two product groups: <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> (WM) and dishwashers (DW). The first chapter is devoted the environmental assessment of durability of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and dishwashers, {{by means of the}} “Resource Efficiency Assessment of PROducts – REAPro” method. The second chapter introduces a detailed analysis of the reuse of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and dishwashers, in which the authors presents a new method for the environmental assessment of the reuse of products The third chapter provides a statistical analysis of repair services conducted on <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and dishwashers over the timeline 2009 - 2015. Based on the results and information provided in the three main chapters summarised above, the authors conclude this work with a final section, which conveys analyses into potential product recommendations for future policy discussion on durability, reusability and reparability of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and dishwashers.
