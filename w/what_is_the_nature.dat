25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance of this discussion? However, there was very little agreement about concepts, measurement principles, and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. All kinds of different political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is bound to happen, because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with illusions about reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, that this kind of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis of the Talmud {{and later}} times {{interpreted}} the Shmita laws {{in various ways}} to ease the burden they created for farmers and the agricultural industry. The Heter Mechirah (leniency of sale), developed for the Shmita year of 1888–1889, permitted Jewish farmers to sell their land to non-Jews {{so that they could}} continue to work the land as usual during Shmita. This temporary solution to the impoverishment of the Jewish settlement in those days was later adopted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel as a permanent edict, generating ongoing controversy between Zionist and Haredi leaders to this day. There is a major debate among halakhic authorities as to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the obligation of the Sabbatical year nowadays. Some say it is still biblically binding, as it has always been. Others hold that it is rabbinically binding, since the Shmita only biblically applies when the Jubilee year is in effect, but the Sages of the Talmud legislated the observance of the Shmita anyway as a reminder of the biblical statute. And yet others hold that the Shmita has become purely voluntary. An analysis by respected posek and former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef in his responsa Yabi'a Omer (Vol. 10), accorded with the middle option, that the Biblical obligation holds only when a majority of the Jewish people is living in the Biblical Land of Israel and hence the Shmita nowadays is a rabbinic obligation in nature. This approach potentially admits for some leniencies which would not be possible if the Shemitah were biblical in origin, including the aforementioned sale of the land of Israel. Haredi authorities, on the other hand, generally follow the view of the Chazon Ish, that the Shmita continues to be a Biblical obligation.|$|E

500|$|Henkes and Bindervoet {{generally}} summarise {{the critical}} consensus when they argue that, between the thematically indicative {{opening and closing}} chapters, the book concerns [...] "two big questions" [...] which are never resolved: <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of protagonist HCE’s secret sin, {{and what was the}} letter, written by his wife ALP, about? HCE's unidentifiable sin has most generally been interpreted as representing man's original sin {{as a result of the}} Fall of Man. Anthony Burgess sees HCE, through his dream, trying [...] "to make the whole of history swallow up his guilt for him" [...] and to this end [...] "HCE has, so deep in his sleep, sunk to a level of dreaming in which he has become a collective being rehearsing the collective guilt of man." [...] Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that although undefined, [...] "Earwicker's alleged crime in the Park" [...] appears to have been of a [...] "voyeuristic, sexual, or scatological nature". [...] ALP's letter appears a number of times throughout the book, in a number of different forms, and as its contents cannot be definitively delineated, it is usually believed to be both an exoneration of HCE, and an indictment of his sin. Herring argues that [...] "he effect of ALP's letter is precisely the opposite of her intent [...] the more ALP defends her husband in her letter, the more scandal attaches to him." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy argues that [...] "it is appropriate that the waters of the Liffey, representing Anna Livia, are washing away the evidence of Earwicker's sins as [...] for (they tell us) she takes on her husband's guilt and redeems him; alternately she is tainted with his crimes and regarded as an accomplice".|$|E

2500|$|Photometria {{presented}} significant {{advances and}} it was, perhaps, {{for that very}} reason that its appearance was greeted with general indifference. The central optical question {{in the middle of the}} 18th century was: <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of light? Lambert work was not related to this issue at all and so Photometria received no immediate systematic evaluation, and was not incorporated into the mainstream of optical science. The first appraisal of Photometria appeared in 1776 in Georg Klügel’s German translation of Priestley’s 1772 survey of optics. An elaborate reworking and annotation appeared in 1777. [...] Photometria was not seriously evaluated and utilized until nearly a century after its publication, when the science of astronomy and the commerce of gas lighting had need for photometry. Fifty years after that, Illuminating Engineering took up Lambert's results as the basis for lighting calculations that accompanied the great expanse of lighting early in the 20th century. Fifty years after that, computer graphics took up Lambert's results as the basis for radiosity calculations required to produce architectural renderings. Photometria had significant, though long delayed influence on technology and commerce once the industrial revolution was well underway, and is the reason that it was one of book listed in Printing and the Mind of Man.|$|E

40|$|From {{the time}} of Augustus, the Roman agrimensores or land {{surveyors}} provided an important connection between those who administrated the Empire on the one hand, and the territories and peoples they controlled on the other. This work is {{an investigation into the}} surveyors’ use of the cultural capital of Roman society to fashion their own identity as experts in the organisation and regulation of land, and their influence on the shape of discourse about Empire. The study focuses on four questions: 1) <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of <b>the</b> relationship between the agrimensores or surveyors and the Roman provincial administration? 2) <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of <b>the</b> relationship between the agrimensores and the people of the Empire whose lands they surveyed?
