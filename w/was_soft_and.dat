5|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the LNWR found that the bridges and culverts were in a fair condition, but the stations were dirty.

5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings. At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were fitted with bobbins to overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|E
25|$|The two-day, two-innings match {{began on}} Friday 8 July 1910, with the sky grey and overcast. The outfield <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> wet after rain the {{previous}} evening, but the pitch had been covered. The teams included one schoolboy {{who would become}} a field-marshal (Alexander), another an air vice-marshal (Blount), and a third an attorney-general (Monckton), together with various sons of nobility.|$|E

The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, {{as though they were}} held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.|$|E
25|$|England {{once again}} won the toss and chose to bat {{in the second}} Test, but in {{contrast}} to the first match, they made few runs. Only three batsmen reached double figures—Tom Hayward, Johnny Tyldesley and George Hirst—as Faulkner took six wickets for the tourists, getting prodigious turn in both directions with his spin bowling. The pitch <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> difficult to bat on due to the rain, and after lunch nine of England's wickets were lost in under an hour. England were weakened due to their decision to pick a pace bowler, Neville Knox, over a spinner, Jack Crawford, who would have been better suited to the conditions. Accordingly, England relied on Colin Blythe, who bowled for the entire innings and collected eight wickets. Nevertheless, partially due to a number of dropped catches, South Africa scored 110 to lead by 34 runs.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and}} legs to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E

25|$|The {{heights in}} rear of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe, are {{somewhat}} lower than those on the opposite or Fleurus side of the valley; and, from {{the nature of the}} ground, troops, particularly artillery, were more exposed on the former than on the latter, where the undulations afford better cover. The descent from either side into the villages of Wagnelée, Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and Saint-Amand, was gentle: between the latter point and Mont-Potriaux the sides of the valley descend more rapidly: and below that village they become steep, particularly about Tongrinne, Boignée, and Balâtre: while the ground above commanded alternately from side to side. Above Mont-Potriaux, the bed of the valley <b>was</b> <b>soft,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally swampy: below that Mont-Potriaux the ground was still softer. The buildings in the villages were generally of stone, with thatched roofs, and comprised several farm houses with courtyards, presenting great capabilities for defence. Saint-Amand and Boignée were the most salient points of the position, the central portion of which retired considerably, particularly near Mont-Potriaux.|$|E
500|$|The {{battlefield}} stretched {{for nearly}} [...] The extreme right {{flank of the}} Franco-Bavarian army was covered by the Danube; to the extreme left flank lay the undulating pine-covered hills of the Swabian Jura. A small stream, the Nebel, (the ground either side of which <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> marshy and only fordable intermittently), fronted the French line. The French right rested on the village of Blenheim near where the Nebel flows into the Danube; the village itself was surrounded by hedges, fences, enclosed gardens, and meadows. Between Blenheim and the next village of Oberglauheim the fields of wheat had been cut to stubble and were now ideal to deploy troops. From Oberglauheim to the next hamlet of Lutzingen the terrain of ditches, thickets and brambles was potentially difficult ground for the attackers.|$|E

I am 50 now but 25 years ago I was living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> delicious.|$|E

500|$|The {{better part}} of the French army debouched through the Höll valley. Desaix's left wing {{included}} the nine battalions and 12 squadrons of the Division St. Suzanne by Riegel, straddling both shores of the Elz. To the right, between Malterdingen and Emmendingen, Beaupuy commanded a division of 12 battalions and 12 squadrons. [...] Further to the right, by Emmendingen itself, and in the heights by Heimbach, stood Saint-Cyr; around this stretched the Duhesme's Division (12 battalions and eight squadrons). [...] Further to the right of these, in the Elz valley by Waldkirch stood Ambert's division and the Girard brigade; by Zähringen, about a mile away, Lecourbe's brigade stood in reserve, and, stretching northward from there, a mounted division of 14,000 roamed the vicinity of Holzhausen (nowadays part of March, Breisgau). These positions created a line about [...] long. [...] On the far side of Lecorbe's brigade stood Ferino's 15 battalions and 16 squadrons, but these were well to the south and east of Freiburg im Breisgau, still tramping through the mountains. Everyone had been hampered by heavy rains; the ground <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> slippery, and both the Rhine and Elz rivers had flooded, as had the many tributaries. This increased the hazards of mounted attack, because the horses could not get a good footing.|$|E

2500|$|Michigan {{faced the}} University of Minnesota on November 23, {{in a game}} played at the Baseball Park in Detroit. Michigan easily won the game by a score of 20 to 0. The playing field <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> {{slippery}} from snow and rain, and [...] "the wet ball caused {{a good deal of}} fumbling, especially {{on the part of the}} Minnesota team." [...] One account described the playing surface as [...] "a field of mud several inches deep. Minnesota was [...] "practically on the defense throughout the game," [...] and [...] "only twice were her runners able to get through Michigan's line for substantial gains." [...] The report of the game published in the Daily Inter Ocean from Chicago described a dominating performance by the Wolverines:"The men from the far Northwest were clearly outclassed at every point, but played a plucky game. [...] At times their defense was strong and then partly weak, Senter and Ferbert getting through several times for long fifty-yard runs. ... The Michigan men played savagely during the first half ... For Michigan the particulars were Senter, Ferbert, Bloomingston and Henninger, though the entire team played excellently and was very strong in interference." ...|$|E

As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years.
