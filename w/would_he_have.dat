25|$|Thus Gregory VII, as a {{politician}} wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged {{the existence of the}} state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the sacerdotium and the imperium. But at no period <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> dreamed of putting the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state was to him a fact which admitted of no discussion and which he had never doubted.|$|E

He denied any involvement in Moore's disappearance or death, saying {{that she had been}} a good tenant who had paid her rent on time. If he had killed her, he asked, why <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> cooperated with the police investigation as much as he had, to the point of allowing officers to search his home without obtaining a search warrant? He said they had only considered him as a suspect after he filed suit for their allegedly taking money from the basement.|$|E
25|$|Though Crosby {{did want}} {{more time to}} tend to his other {{business}} and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the microphones his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio {{since the beginning of}} the electrical era. No longer <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.|$|E

500|$|The writer Rupert Gould, in {{a lengthy}} essay on New South Greenland [...] {{published}} in 1929, queries {{the assumption that the}} [...] sighting was simply invented by Morrell, partly on the grounds that very little weight is given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: [...] "If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his pi√®ces justificatives, after he had forged them, in an undistinguished [...] corner of so bulky a book."

[...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on as if nothing had happened, is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out.

In {{an interview with}} The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet, when asked, [...] "What if [...] never heard the prophecy?", she said, [...] "It's the 'Macbeth' idea. I absolutely adore 'Macbeth.'

[...] On her website, she referred to Macbeth again in discussing the prophecy: [...] "the prophecy (like the one the witches make to Macbeth, if anyone has read the play of the same name) becomes the catalyst for a situation that would never have occurred {{if it had not}} been made." [...] More playfully, Rowling also invented a musical band popular in the Wizarding world called The Weird Sisters that appears in passing in several books in the series as well as the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The third Harry Potter movie's soundtrack featured a song by John Williams called [...] "Double Trouble", a reference to the witches' line, [...] "Double double, toil and trouble". The lyrics of the song were adapted from the Three Witches' spell in the play.|$|E

[...] Cox initially claimed that the bets were made by his business associates. [...] However, he eventually admitted to placing several small bets, not knowing it was against the rules. [...] This made no difference to Landis, who banned Cox from baseball for life. Author Rich Westcott was quoted by Sports Illustrated as saying Cox knew [...] "next to nothing about baseball.

2500|$|According to the album's liner notes, [...] "No Time or Space" [...] was {{recorded}} [...] "in California in November 1968 {{with the assistance}} of Bernie Krause". Krause later said that [...] "No Time or Space" [...] (UK LP side two, US LP side one) was essentially a recording of him demonstrating the Moog III to Harrison in Los Angeles, following a session for Jackie Lomax's album Is This What You Want?, which Harrison was producing at the time. Krause also claimed that the demonstration {{was recorded}} without his knowledge and nor <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> given his consent, since his playing was a preview of a piece he intended to include on the next Beaver & Krause album.

2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah {{differed}} {{interpreting the}} words, [...] "Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah taught that only [...] "in his generations" [...] {{was he a}} righteous man (by comparison). Had {{he lived in the}} generation of Moses or Samuel, he would not have been called righteous. Rabbi Judah said that in the street of the totally blind, the one-eyed man is called clear-sighted, and the infant is called a scholar. Rabbi Judah compared it to a man with a wine vault who opened one barrel and found it vinegar, opened another and found it vinegar, and opened a third to find it turning sour. When people told him that it was turning, he asked if the vault contained any better. Similarly, [...] "in his generations" [...] Noah was a righteous man. Rabbi Nehemiah, however, taught that if Noah was righteous even in his generation (in spite of the corrupt environment), how much more so <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been, had he lived in the age of Moses. Rabbi Nehemiah compared Noah to a tightly closed vial of perfume in a graveyard, which nevertheless gave forth a fragrant aroma. How much more fragrant would it have been outside the graveyard.|$|E
2500|$|Another of Caird's lifelong preoccupations was Paul the Apostle, seen {{particularly}} in his works Principalities and Powers, Paul's Letters from Prison, and comments scattered throughout The Language and Imagery of the Bible and New Testament Theology. For Caird Paul {{has not been}} given his proper due by modern scholarly opinion {{in terms of the}} uniqueness and importance of his contribution to Christianity. As a dyed-in-the-wool Cambridge-trained classicist, Caird saw Paul {{not so much as a}} conveyor of supernatural information but as a brilliantly innovative thinker, a skillful interpreter of the scriptures and of the mind of Jesus, or [...] "humanity at its very best". Paul was also a revolutionary, as Caird saw him: one who was fervently committed to the socially convulsive implications of the gospel, especially in such concerns as class divisions within society (including the equality of women), the constant corruption of political and religious authority, and the unity of the Christian church as a rebuke to a warring and fractured world. In all his works Caird never shrank from making clear his unqualified admiration for what he saw as the frequently misunderstood apostle; yet this could hardly be mistaken for hero worship. He could disagree with Paul at times, and [...] "if he had ever seen [...] approaching in the High Street, he wouldn't have treated him with exaggerated deference, nor <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> crossed the street to avoid him. He would probably have invited him to read a paper to his Postgraduate Seminar, and would have felt no embarrassment at taking him into the Senior Common Room for tea beforehand". In certain ways Caird contributed to the debate concerning the New Perspective on Paul, seen perhaps most visibly in an extended review of E. P. Sanders's work Paul and Palestinian Judaism.|$|E
