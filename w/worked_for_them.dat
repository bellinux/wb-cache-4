25|$|The {{number of}} Bedouins who started {{settling}} the Negev region from the 7th century considerably increased during Ottoman rule {{as a result}} of immigration of both Bedouin tribes from south and east and peasant farmers (fellahins) from Egypt. The Egyptian fellahins settled mostly in the region around Gaza and received protection from Bedouins, in return for goods. Bedouins brought African slaves (abid) from Sudan who <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> To reduce frictions and to stabilize the boundaries between Bedouin tribes, the Ottomans established an administrative center in Beersheba around 1900, as the first planned settlement in Negev since the Nabatean and Byzantine times.

500|$|Coming Up to Breathe {{received}} positive reception {{from music}} critics. Steve Losey of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "In a concerted effort to revert back to the days when they were more a rock band and less of a hitmaking machine, MercyMe delivers. While it's certainly not heavy metal, the songs definitely keep driving forward. Guitars are more prominent and production leans on a more earthy formula... MercyMe is able to rock on portions of each song but they always bring it back to a memorable chorus or a hooky verse. That's the formula that has always <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> and it does here, too". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted that [...] "For the most part, MercyMe has built a multiplatinum foundation on compelling power ballads. But on this set, the Texas band rocks out with passion and edgy intensity. It doesn't stray so far that it would alienate the faithful, but it delivers a powerful collection of pop/rock that should take the band's career to a new level". She also praised Millard's vocals and called it a [...] "landmark album in an already impressive career". Mark Joseph of CCM Magazine gave the album a B-; he called the album [...] "enjoyable" [...] but suggesting that a stronger producer or A team would have resulted in better lyrics. Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten stars, praising the vocals and string arrangements as well as the choir on [...] "Bring the Rain". Russ Breimeier of The Fish called Coming Up to Breathe MercyMe's [...] "best album to date" [...] and an [...] "impressive {{step in the right direction}} for a band that many have pegged to be too formulaic", but derided the album's [...] "simplistic songwriting".|$|E

[...] In AAA, he started a feud with Cibernético, with the storyline being started when Cibernético attacked Shocker's father who was at ringside for one of Shocker's matches. The feud reached its high point with a four-way Lucha de Apuestas match that included Shocker, Cibernético, Latin Lover and Chessman. The match was a steel cage match, with the added stipulation that the cage was supposedly electrified. The four faced off in the main event of AAA's 2005 Verano de Escándalo ("Summer of Scandal") PPV and saw Chessman lose the match to Latin Lover, while Shocker escaped the match without losing his hair. Following {{the conclusion of the}} storyline with Cibernético, Shocker turned rudo, attacking veteran Sangre Chicana. The storyline was that [...] Shocker claimed that he was the real Amo de escandalo ("Master of Scandal"), which was Chicana's nickname at that point. The two faced off in a hair vs. hair match at the El Toreo de Cuatros Caminos bullfighting arena in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, with Shocker defeating Sangre Chicana in the semi-main evnt of the 2005 Guerra de Titanes ("War of the Titans"). In 2006 Shocker formed Los Guapos VIP in AAA, consisting of himself, Scorpio Jr. and Zumbido. The trio participated in a four-way trios match at the 2006 Rey de Reyes ("King of Kings") show, but were eliminated {{before the end of the}} match. Los Guapos later expanded with Alan Stone, allowing them to wrestle The Black Family (Chessman, Dark Ozz, Dark Cuervo and Dark Escoria) for the Mexican National Atómicos Championship on March 19, 2006 but were unsuccessful.
