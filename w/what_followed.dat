5|$|During {{the nearby}} Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the North Korean People's Army {{broke through the}} US Army's 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the NK 9th Division and NK 4th Division {{attacked}} to Yongsan, a village east {{of the river and}} the gateway to the UN lines of supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was a fight between North Korean and US forces for Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided {{a number}} of ranches that {{supplied}} cattle to the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area. As {{a result of this}} and a series of recent killings, a preemptive attack was organized to discourage future depredations. Therefore, a group of well-armed volunteers were quickly outfitted with King S. Woolsey as their leader. Their mission was to track the raiding party back to their rancheria. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was an infamous footnote in Arizona history known today as the Bloody Tanks incident.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Han dynasty in 220, China {{disintegrated}} into warlord states, {{which in}} 280 were briefly reunited under the Western Jin dynasty (265316). There are ambiguous accounts of the Jin rebuilding the Qin wall, but these walls apparently offered no resistance during the Wu Hu uprising, when the nomadic tribes of the steppe evicted the Chinese court from northern China. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was a succession of short-lived states in northern China known as the Sixteen Kingdoms, until they were all consolidated by the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty (386535).|$|E
5|$|On 11 August, Task Force Bradley {{struck out}} from Yongil Airfield to counterattack the North Korean forces around P'ohang-dong while Task Force P'ohang {{attacked}} from An'gang-ni area. Both forces immediately met resistance from North Korean forces. By that time, the North Korean forces had captured P'ohang-dong. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was a complicated series of fights through the large region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as South Korean ground forces, aided by U.S. air forces engaged groups of North Korean forces operation {{all around the}} vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E

5|$|<b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was {{a border}} war in 1277–78. It was {{reported}} {{mainly in the}} Yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of Marco Polo. Although the Burmese chronicles have no record of the border war, a 1278 Burmese inscription mentions the army's defeat at Ngasaunggyan. The Mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate.|$|E
5|$|<b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was {{a two-week}} battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan {{in which the}} North Koreans were able to {{gradually}} push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, the North Koreans {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, the North Koreans were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu-dong.|$|E
5|$|<b>What</b> <b>followed</b> {{was another}} {{relatively}} disappointing season at Bondi Junction, with the Roosters finishing 11th in a 2011 season plagued by off-field issues involving 2010 Dally M Medallist Todd Carney (who was later sacked by the Roosters at season's end).

5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges first visited Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E
5|$|Positioned {{in defense}} of Masan during the Battle of Masan, the US 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division took up {{positions}} along the Nam River, {{one of the many}} tributaries of the Naktong River on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. The North Korean People's Army's 7th Division effected a crossing of the river on August 31, and though the 35th Infantry was able to stem the North Korean advance, thousands of North Korean troops were able to exploit a hole in the line and surround the regiment. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was an intense battle in which the US and North Korean units were heavily engaged all along and behind the Kum River line. Eventually, though, the North Korean force was routed and defeated by the US troops.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{subsequently}} {{planned a}} simultaneous offensive for their entire army along five axes of the perimeter; and on September 1 intense fighting erupted around {{the cities of}} Masan, Kyongju, Taegu, Yongch'on and the Naktong Bulge. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was two weeks of extremely brutal fighting as the two sides vied to control the routes into Pusan. Initially successful in some areas, the North Koreans were unable to hold their gains against the numerically and technologically superior UN force. The North Korean army, again stalled at the failure of this offensive, was subsequently destroyed in the UN counterattack at Inchon.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} the war {{delineated}} itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed {{the bulk of the}} scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, {{towards the end of the}} war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad. This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania {{were the}} twenty Lithuanian men {{who signed the}} Act of Independence of Lithuania on February 16, 1918. The signatories were elected to the Council of Lithuania by the Vilnius Conference in September 1917 and {{entrusted}} with the mission of establishing an independent Lithuanian state. The proclaimed independence was established only in late 1918, after Germany lost World War I and its troops retreated from Lithuanian territory. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was a long process of building the state, determining its borders, and gaining international diplomatic recognition. The signatories succeeded in their mission and independent Lithuania survived until the Soviet Union occupied the state on June 15, 1940.|$|E
5|$|<b>What</b> <b>followed</b> {{is unclear}} {{as there are}} several versions. Oesau was chased by 1st Lt. James Leslie Doyle, 1st Lt. Wilbur L. Jarvis III and 1st Lt. James C. Austin, of the 428th Fighter Squadron (474th FG, 9th AF). All three were {{experienced}} pilots and chased Oesau from 28,000 feet to tree-top level. In the ensuing 20 minute dogfight, Oesau defended skillfully, though his aircraft was damaged by gunfire. While attempting an emergency landing, his Gustav received a final burst of fire in the cockpit area and crashed into the ground 6 miles south west of St. Vith. His body was thrown clear of the aircraft some yards away.|$|E

5|$|<b>What</b> <b>followed</b> next is {{not entirely}} clear, but Heraclius {{certainly}} won a crushing victory over Shahrbaraz {{in the fall of}} 622. The key factor was Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by feigning retreat during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite Optimatoi assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee. Thus he saved Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius had to return to Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the Avars, so he left his army to winter in Pontus.|$|E
5|$|<b>What</b> <b>followed</b> {{this period}} of Antarctic {{interest}} is what historian H. R. Mill called 'the age of averted interest'. Following the expedition South by the ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror under James Clark Ross (January, 1841), he suggested {{that there were no}} scientific discoveries, or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South. It is considered that Ross' influence, as well as the loss of the Franklin expedition in the Arctic, led to disinterest in polar inquiry, particularly by The Royal Society: the British-founded organization that helped oversee many Arctic explorations, including those that would be made by Shackleton and Scott. However, in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there is a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. <b>What</b> <b>followed</b> was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
