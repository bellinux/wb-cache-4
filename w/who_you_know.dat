Just as ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald aired a feature on Cassidy, the album topped the chart. Shot at Blues Alley by a friend with a camcorder the same night the album was recorded, the video became the most requested video ever shown on Top Of The Pops 2.

500|$|Rashad enjoyed {{working with}} both Cosby {{and the young}} cast, {{claiming}} that the actors very much became like a real family {{as early as the}} first episode, although her real-life relationship with the child actors more-so resembled that of friends as opposed to mother. Rashad said, [...] "I think Bill and I are great role models as far as our TV professions are concerned. Kids learn by example, and I think we're very good ones." [...] Second to Cosby himself, Rashad is the series' most regular cast member, appearing in a total of 212 episodes. In response to television personality Oprah Winfrey quoting a common critique of the series – [...] "How is it realistic to have a doctor and a lawyer in the same house?" [...] – Rashad defended, [...] "I grew up in Houston, Texas, in Third Ward, and it was very realistic. … I guess it just depends on <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> and what you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2010, it was {{confirmed}} by the studio that Martin Freeman had officially been cast {{in the role of}} Bilbo Baggins. It was revealed that he had earlier been approached by the producers {{to play a role in}} the films, but was forced to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts with the BBC television series Sherlock. At the time, Freeman was quoted as saying, [...] "f something could be worked out, that would be great. I did it [...] with a heavy heart, definitely." [...] On his casting, Peter Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times in your career when you come across an actor <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman. He is intelligent, funny, surprising and brave—exactly like Bilbo and I feel incredibly proud to be able to announce that he is our Hobbit." ...|$|E

[...] He was assigned to St. Mary's Pre-Flight School in Moraga, California. [...] Cappon missed the 1943–1944 through 1945–1946 basketball seasons while serving in the Navy. [...] Cappon was a lieutenant in the Naval Aviation fitness program, where he wrote training texts and directed athletics for the fleet airwing on the West Coast. [...] After returning to Princeton, Cappon was outspoken {{on the value of}} athletics as an equalizer in American society. [...] In a 1952 speech, Cappon said: [...] "There are some basic principles that we're gradually losing sight of in America, but we still have them in athletics. [...] When you come out for an athletic team, your race, creed or color makes no difference. [...] Nobody asks you <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> or how much money you've got.

40|$|The {{traditional}} career {{public service}} model of employment was ostensibly {{based on the}} merit principle. It was considered that merit criteria would ensure employment based on what <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> rather than <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew,</b> and remove patronage. This paper challenges this claim through an historical review of Queensland public employment. It finds that although the merit principle was often enshrined in legislation, subsequent regulations, policies and practices subverted this legislative intention. Merit was balanced against social values including gender and class discrimination, and against circumstances such as wars. This had implications for the skill levels and quality of public employees, and therefore for public policy and public services.
