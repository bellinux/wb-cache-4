5|$|During the pre-modern era early {{forms of}} {{globalization}} were {{already beginning to}} affect a <b>world</b> <b>system,</b> marking a period that historian A. G. Hopkins has called archaic globalization. The <b>world</b> <b>system</b> leading up to proto-globalization was one that hinged on one or more hegemonic powers assimilating neighboring cultures into their political system, waging war on other nations, and dominating world trade.|$|E
5|$|These routes – {{spreading}} religion, {{trade and}} technology – {{have historically been}} vital {{to the growth of}} urban civilization. The extent of development of cities, and the level of their integration into a larger <b>world</b> <b>system,</b> has often been attributed to their position in various active transport networks.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic <b>world</b> <b>system,</b> which held that Earth {{was at the center of}} the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E

5|$|The Galilean moons were {{discovered}} in either 1609 or 1610 when Galileo made improvements to his telescope, which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever. Galileo's discovery showed {{the importance of the}} telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. More importantly, the incontrovertible discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic <b>world</b> <b>system,</b> or the geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not great. The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main {{effect of the}} Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist <b>world</b> <b>system</b> after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E
5|$|Trotsky and his {{supporters}} had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the Soviet economy. Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism was a <b>world</b> <b>system</b> and required a world revolution in order {{to replace it with}} socialism. Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.|$|E

25|$|Political Economy in {{anthropology}} is {{the application of}} the theories and methods of Historical Materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies.

25|$|The first {{teletext}} test transmissions {{were made}} by Ceefax in 1973. After proliferation of the BBC system in the UK, it was adopted in Europe and standardised as <b>World</b> <b>System</b> Teletext (WST). The World Wide Web began to take {{over some of the}} functions of teletext from the late 1990s and many broadcasters have ceased broadcast of teletext—CNN in 2006 and the BBC in 2012. In the UK the decline of teletext has been hastened by the introduction of digital television, though an aspect of teletext continues in closed captioning. In other countries the system is still widely used on standard-definition DVB broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|During the Delhi Sultanate, {{there was}} a {{synthesis}} between Indian civilization and Islamic civilization. The latter was a cosmopolitan civilization, with a multicultural and pluralistic society, and wide-ranging international networks, including social and economic networks, spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, leading to escalating circulation of goods, peoples, technologies and ideas. While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing <b>world</b> <b>system,</b> drawing India into a wider international network, which {{had a significant impact}} on Indian culture and society.|$|E

Copernicus pointed out that if {{the movement of the}} earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun.|$|E

25|$|Before {{and during}} the Delhi Sultanate, Islamic civilization was the most {{cosmopolitan}} civilization of the Middle Ages. It had a multicultural and pluralistic society, and wide-ranging international networks, including social and economic networks, spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, leading to escalating circulation of goods, peoples, technologies and ideas. While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing <b>world</b> <b>system,</b> drawing India into a wider international network, which led to cultural and social enrichment in the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|From the 1850s {{until well}} into the 20th century, British {{submarine}} cable systems dominated the <b>world</b> <b>system.</b> This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the All Red Line. In 1896, there were thirty cable laying ships in the world and twenty-four of them were owned by British companies. In 1892, British companies owned and operated two-thirds of the world's cables and by 1923, their share was still 42.7 percent. During World War I, Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.|$|E
25|$|During {{and in the}} Delhi Sultanate, {{there was}} a {{synthesis}} of Indian civilization with that of Islamic civilization, and the further integration of the Indian subcontinent with a growing <b>world</b> <b>system</b> and wider international networks spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, which {{had a significant impact}} on Indian culture and society, as well as the wider world. The time of their rule included the earliest forms of Indo-Islamic architecture, increased growth rates in India's population and economy, and the emergence of the Hindi-Urdu language. The Delhi Sultanate was also responsible for repelling the Mongol Empire's potentially devastating invasions of India in the 13th and 14th centuries. However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused destruction and desecration of politically important temples in South Asia. In 1526, the Sultanate was conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire.|$|E
