25|$|The FIDONET {{program was}} what later {{became known as}} a mailer. FIDO was {{modified}} to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a node number for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.|$|E

[...] The boy asked, [...] "What's that?" [...] Timberlake explained they were Bible verses, {{and he told}} reporters he started doing it about six months earlier, hoping the kids <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> the verses. [...] In 1965, such public religious expressions were not common among athletes, and columnists made note {{of the fact that}} Timberlake [...] "packs a Bible in his suitcase and keeps one in his locker." ...|$|E

Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe {{there are thousands of}} heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release. A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the [...] "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out {{more than one or two}} [...] year ... The complex one is really The Defenders. The Defenders production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." [...] He also noted on potential spin-offs that [...] "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" [...] into their own series at some point, with Netflix ordering Marvel's The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil, that April. Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the Defenders series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.|$|E
500|$|His father Antonio {{received}} guitar {{lessons from}} {{the hand of a}} cousin of Melchor de Marchena: Manuel Fernández (aka Titi de Marchena), a guitarist who arrived in Algeciras in the 1920s and established a school there. Antonio introduced Paco to the guitar at a young age and was extremely strict in his upbringing from the age of 5, forcing him to practice up to 12 hours a day, every day, to ensure that he could find success as a professional musician. At one point, his father took him out of school to concentrate solely on his guitar development. In a 2012 interview de Lucía stated that, [...] "I learned the guitar like a child learns to speak." [...] Flamenco guitarist and biographer Donn Pohren and record producer [...] José Torregrosa compared Paco's relationship with his father to the relationship of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Leopold Mozart in the way both fathers [...] "moulded their sons" [...] into becoming world-class musicians, and both continued to dictate even after the latter became famous. Paco's brother Ramón idolized Niño Ricardo, and taught his complex falsetas to his young brother, who would learn them with relative ease and change them to his own liking and embellish them. This initially angered Ramón, who considered Ricardo's works to be sacred and thought his brother was showing off; but he soon began to respect his brother immensely, and came to realize that he was a prodigious talent, fuera de serie (out of the ordinary). As also with Ramón, Ricardo was Paco's most important influence, and his first guitar hero; Paco said [...] "all of us youngsters <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to him, trying to learn from him and copy him." [...] In 1958, at age 11, Paco made his first public appearance on Radio Algeciras. That year, he met Sabicas {{for the first time in}} Málaga. A year later, he was awarded a special prize at the Festival Concurso International Flamenco de Jerez de la Frontera flamenco competition.|$|E

There was a saying at that time to describe this: [...] "If {{there is a problem with}} the tune, Zhou Yu will look up." ...|$|E

[...] IBM also demonstrated handwriting recognition on a mainframe computer that <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> what happened on a particular date that a person wrote down—for many visitors, this was their first hands-on interaction with a computer.|$|E
2500|$|Wahlgren {{has been}} {{involved}} in a number of video games. Her first voice-over role in video games was in [...] where she played Willow Rosenberg. In the James Bond video game From Russia with Love, released in 2005, she voiced a Bond girl that was paired with Sean Connery's original voice. In 2006, she landed leading roles of Ashe in Final Fantasy XII and Shelke in Dirge of Cerberus – Final Fantasy VII. In an interview conducted by UFFSite and RPGSite, she recounts how she received notice of the roles on two consecutive days, and said that the franchise was like [...] "the holy grail of video game acting". She portrayed Ashe with a bit of a regal tone, after the director encouraged her to do so following a class where she was doing Shakespeare. She describes her character as someone a girl <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to as [...] "intelligent, diplomatic, and can kick ass and look good doing it". In contrast, Shelkie was desired to be portrayed as very cold and emotionless, which she describes as [...] "cold, but sympathetic." [...] In 2007, she voiced the playable title character in the strategy-RPG Jeanne d'Arc.|$|E

2500|$|Daredevil is {{the first}} of the ordered Netflix series, and is {{followed}} by Marvel's Jessica Jones, Marvel's Luke Cage, and Marvel's Iron Fist, which lead to the miniseries, Marvel's The Defenders. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, [...] "It's quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In December 2014, Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ...

But that doesn't necessarily mean that we <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] Dawson later elaborated that [...] "When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit [...] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs—bones are going to break. People aren't hitting each other and nothing's going to happen because they're indestructible. These are people. They're vulnerable and you get to experience that." ...|$|E
