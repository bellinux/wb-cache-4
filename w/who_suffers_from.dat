40|$|Number of {{patients}} with hypertension have increased from year to year. This is due to an unhealthy lifestyle, excessive stress and so forth. Patiens with hypertension are often unaware of the dangers that {{can be caused by}} disease. The medical diagnosis of hypertension is made when obtained blood pressure is obtained more than 140 / 90 mmHg. In this study, created a system of enforcement of hypertension using sugeno fuzzy logic. This application uses the parameters of age, body mass index, blod pressure(systole and diastole), family history (genetics), diabetes mellitus. From testing the fuzzy logic that has been done, can be obtained on the calculation of 60 patients <b>who</b> did not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension (normal) as much 3 people, <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> prehypertension as much 17 people, <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension grade 1 as much 25 people and <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension degrees 2 as much 15 people.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the perceptions of}} family environment, body image and self esteem of women <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and depression. Using a nonequivalent control group design, {{one hundred and fifty}} women with anorexia nervosa (n = 50), bulimia nervosa (n = 50), and depression (n = 50) were given the Family Environment Scale (FES) and the Eating Disorders Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2). The objectives of this study were to: (1) study how women with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa perceive their family environment as measured by the FES; (2) compare and contrast perceptions of family environment of women with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa with the control group; (3) compare and contrast perceived levels of self esteem and body image as measured by the EDI- 2 of women with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa with the control group; and (4) examine the perceived family environments of eating disordered and non-eating disordered women with regard to body image and self esteem. Results suggested, women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa scored significantly lower (p 3 ̆c. 021) on the Expressiveness, Intellectual-Cultural Orientation, and Active-Recreational subscales of the FES. The results also indicated that women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> bulimia nervosa scored significantly higher (p 3 ̆c. 015) than women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> anorexia nervosa on the Conflict and Independence subscales of the FES. The results of studying these three populations reflected that women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> anorexia nervosa scored significantly different (p 3 ̆c. 000) than women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> bulimia nervosa on many of the subscales of the EDI- 2. The findings of the study confirmed that women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa scored significantly different (p 3 ̆c. 000) on the subscales of the EDI- 2 compared to women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> depression. It was also confirmed that a relationship does exist between perceptions of body image and self esteem and perceptions of family environment amongst women with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa as compared to depressed women. The findings of the study indicated that women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> anorexia nervosa tended to: be less expressive and independent; handle conflict less openly; have a greater drive for thinness; have greater body dissatisfaction; be more perfectionistic; and struggle more intensely with fears around maturity and social insecurity than did women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> bulimia nervosa or depression. In addition, the findings of the study also suggested that women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> bulimia nervosa tended to: be raised in homes where openly expressed anger is permitted amongst family members; have a lesser drive for thinness; have less body dissatisfaction; be less perfectionistic; and not struggle as intensely with fears around maturity and social insecurity as do women <b>who</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> anorexia nervosa, but more than women <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression. Treatment implications that may assist community college professors and counselors in meeting the special needs of this special group of women were also discussed.

5|$|In {{incidents}} on 18 April, 21 May and 15 December, {{tear gas}} grenades were fired at Rajab's {{house in the}} village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants. In the first incident, HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family's compound as US-manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain's security forces would have had access. Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab's 78-year-old mother <b>who</b> <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> respiratory disease, causing her great distress. On 21 May, four gas grenades were fired at the house. This time, according to Rajab, the grenades were smaller than those used in the mid-April assault and there were no marks identifying the manufacturer.|$|E

However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss.

5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; it is her sister <b>who</b> <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> bipolar disorder.|$|E
