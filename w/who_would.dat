5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 {{percent of the}} electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell. Even before Lincoln’s inauguration, the Deep South states that had cast Electoral College votes for John C. Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention {{for the sole purpose of}} considering secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be labelled Conditional Unionists <b>who</b> <b>would</b> favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at “coercion”, and those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> later be called Unconditional Unionists <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified physical and behavioral differences between parents who produce sons {{and those who}} produce daughters. However, the possibility {{that men and women}} have predictions about the sexes of their offspring based on these differences, or any other interoceptive cues, has not been investigated. We compared the dominance, sociosexual orientation, estradiol, testosterone, and 2 D: 4 D ratios of men and women <b>who</b> predicted they <b>would</b> conceive a boy as their first child with those who predicted a girl. Women <b>who</b> predicted they <b>would</b> have a boy were more dominant and less sociosexually restricted than those <b>who</b> predicted they <b>would</b> have a girl. Men <b>who</b> predicted they <b>would</b> have a girl had higher salivary estradiol and higher (more feminine) 2 D: 4 D ratios than those <b>who</b> predicted they <b>would</b> have a boy. Possible implications of these results are discussed in the context of evolutionary theory...|$|R
