The Alliance, which had been formed two months earlier, comprised 60 clergy from 10 denominations, [...] "the first racially integrated association of Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in Mississippi." [...] Nussbaum had helped found it, merging into it the Jackson Interfaith Fellowship. The Reverend Thomas Tiller, the Alliance president, stated that [...] "by default, we may have contributed to a climate of opinion which gives rise to terrorism.

Berman originally described the episode as a press junket when talking about [...] at an event held by UPN for the Television Critics Association. He {{said it was a}} [...] "very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an 'Odd Couple' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun." [...] Bakula also explained {{in an interview with the}} website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will [...] "find out a lot of stuff about [...] that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!" [...] Billingsley said later that he enjoyed working with Bakula on this episode and called [...] "A Night in Sickbay" [...] one of his favourites.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{fought in}} the wars against Denmark, Austria and France. Although he had opposed {{military}} action in each case, once war had started he supported the Prussian military wholeheartedly and took positions of command. Since he had no political influence at all, these were opportunities to prove himself. Frederick experienced his first combat in the Second Schleswig War. Appointed to supervise the supreme German Confederation commander Field Marshal Wrangel and his staff, the Crown Prince tactfully managed disputes between Wrangel and the other officers. The Prussians and their Austrian allies defeated the Danes and conquered {{the southern part of}} Jutland, but after the war they spent two years politicking to assume leadership of the German states. This culminated in the Austro-Prussian War. Frederick [...] "was {{the only member of the}} Prussian Crown Council to uphold the rights of the Duke of Augustenberg and oppose the idea of a war with Austria which he described as fratricide." [...] Although he supported unification and the restoration of the medieval empire, [...] "Fritz could not accept that war was the right way to unite Germany.". However, when war with Austria broke out, he accepted command of one of Prussia's three armies, with General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal as his chief of staff. The timely arrival of his II Army was crucial to the Prussian victory in 1866 at the decisive Battle of Königgrätz, which won the war for Prussia. After the battle, William presented Frederick with the Order Pour le Mérite for his personal gallantry on the field and leadership of the II Army. Nevertheless, the bloodshed caused him great dismay. A few days before Königgrätz, Frederick had written to his wife, expressing his hope that this would be the last war he would have to fight. On the third day of the battle he wrote to her again: [...] "Who knows whether <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to wage a third war in order to keep what we have now won?" ...|$|E

According to Stylianos Alexiou (in Kretologia 8), a number of sites (especially early and middle Minoan sites such as Aghia Photia) are built on hilltops or otherwise fortified. Lucia Nixon wrote, [...] "We may have been over-influenced by the lack of what we might think of as solid fortifications to assess the archaeological evidence properly.

When he joined Len Hutton on 164/7 the home side looked like getting a first innings lead and one gentleman even booked {{a flight to}} Auckland {{in the hope of}} seeing New Zealand's first Test victory. Hutton told Tyson to [...] "Stick around for a while Frank, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to bat again", a prediction that Tyson later thought verged on second sight. He did hang round a bit and made 27 not out in England's 246.

500|$|Music was a {{major part}} of {{everyday}} life. [...] The word itself derives from Greek μουσική (mousike), [...] "(art) of the Muses". Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres. In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments <b>we</b> use <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier.|$|R

40|$|Geoarchaeological {{research}} is now commonly undertaken {{as an integral}} component of archaeological investigations {{across much of the}} world. However, in humid tropical regions there is a relative shortfall of this Earth-Science approach to understanding archaeological records. In these regions, where hot and humid conditions prevail for significant parts of the year, sedimentological records are prone to high levels of diagenesis, bioturbation and weathering. This means that understanding and quantifying archaeological site formation processes can be very challenging because <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sufficient existing data with which to decipher the stratigraphic (and microstratigraphic) features recorded in these sequences. In this paper we introduce a special issue of. Journal of Archaeological Science in which we showcase a selection of geoarchaeological research from across the equatorial regions of five continents, highlighting the types of stratigraphic sequences and sedimentological features that are likely to be encountered, and evaluating the tools that can be employed to maximise the geoarchaeological potential of these unique records. Additionally, we use this opportunity to review geoarchaeology in the humid tropics from a global perspective, outlining the main problems that geoarchaeologists face working in these environments and the techniques available to mitigate them...|$|R

The advent of {{genome-wide}} association (GWA) technology has transformed the landscape of human genetic research.
