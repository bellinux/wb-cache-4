5|$|Rivalry between Brooks and Clayton predated the 1868 election. Clayton saw Brooks as {{his strongest}} {{competitor}} for preference and distinction {{and did not}} want him to become too entrenched with the party leadership. Brooks felt that his ability and service to the party <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> recognized or appreciated, and he grew bitter and resentful of the other Republicans, including Clayton.|$|E
5|$|During May 1908 {{the workers}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> paid {{regularly}} enough, and took to a strike on 6 June; 2,120 men {{were at the}} most in strike. As a consequence Norsk Hydro {{became a member of}} Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NAF). Negotiations were conducted in August, but failed—not until Minister of Labour Nils Claus Ihlen meddled and Sam Eyde pulled Norsk Hydro out of NAF and reduced his demands did the strike end, on 6 October.|$|E

5|$|The Original All Blacks {{introduced}} several innovations to rugby in France and the British Isles. At {{the time}} of their tour many critics in the Northern Hemisphere blamed the use of the wing–forward for the All Blacks success. These critics claimed this player—who fed the ball into the scrum—would obstruct opposition players, and that the only reason they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> penalised was due to poor refereeing. Their success however was due to a combination of factors, the most important being the team's discipline and organisation, which was described at the time as a scientific approach.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in possession of weapons, and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It {{was clear from the}} outset that the NDH weapons laws <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E

5|$|Sales were satisfactory, and the {{development}} of sequels began almost immediately after The Witcher release. The team began the design work for The Witcher 2 , and experimented with consoles to develop a new engine for The Witcher 3. Their development was halted when the team began work on , a console version of The Witcher. Although they collaborated with French studio Widescreen Games for the console port, it entered development limbo. Widescreen demanded more manpower, money and time to develop the title, complaining that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> paid; according to Iwiński, CD Projekt paid them more than their own staff members. The team cancelled the project, suspending its development. Unhappy with the decision, Atari demanded that CD Projekt repay them for funding the console port development and Iwiński agreed that Atari would be the North American publisher of the sequel of The Witcher 2. CD Projekt acquired Metropolis Software in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} found that crewing {{of the train}} was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members of the train support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation of the train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the diocese}} of Constance, Bernhardin Sanson was {{offering}} a special indulgence for contributors to the building of St Peter's in Rome. When Sanson arrived {{at the gates of}} Zurich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after Martin Luther published his Ninety-five theses (31 October 1517). The council of Zurich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.|$|E

5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E

5|$|Roughly a {{month after}} the storm, a benefit concert was held in St. John's. The concert raised about $400,000 (2010CAD) toward storm relief in one night. In late October, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador {{allocated}} $275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in Marystown and Port Union. However, union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600work hours. Following {{more than a year of}} discussions, the plant's parent company, Ocean Choice International, decided to permanently shut down operations on December2, 2011. Numerous insurance claims, reaching $65million by early November, were made following Hurricane Igor's landfall Over the course of the recovery phase, several complaints, including concerns lodged by church ministers, that relief funds for victims of the storm <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long. Roughly ten months after the hurricane, work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the Burin Peninsula. By January 24, 2011, The Salvation Army received about $1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by Hurricane Igor, roughly half of which had been distributed at that point. An additional $200,000 had been pledged by donors.|$|E
5|$|The wing's {{operations}} expanded during February 1944. No. 23 Squadron entered combat on 11 February when six of its aircraft, {{operating in}} conjunction with six from No. 24 Squadron, bombed three villages south of Saidor in support of United States Army forces. The next day twelve aircraft from No. 23 Squadron and six from No. 24 Squadron made unsuccessful attacks against a road near Bogadjim after bad weather forced the cancellation of a close air support mission. For {{the remainder of the}} month, No. 78 Wing's main tasks were to attack the Japanese Army's 20th Division as it retreated from Allied forces and to strike Japanese airfields at Alexishafen and Madang. On 22 February, aircraft from all three of the wing's squadrons attacked camouflaged Japanese barge harbours near Madang; this was No. 21 Squadron's first combat operation. The next day ten Vengeances bombed Saidor. On 24 February, 23 Vengeances from Nos. 21 and 23 Squadrons struck Japanese anti-aircraft gun positions at Hansa Bay. Two aircraft from No. 23 Squadron were shot down with the loss of their crews. On 26, 27 and 28 February all three of the wing's squadrons attacked the airfields at Madang and Alexishafen to prevent Japanese forces from using them to attack the Allied forces which had landed on the Admiralty Islands. The first and second of these operations involved twelve aircraft from each squadron. A total of 33 Vengeances were dispatched for the operation on 28 February, when they and No. 78 Wing combined to form an attack force of 62 aircraft. Despite the size of these operations, No. 77 Wing's aircrew judged that the airfields <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> used by the Japanese as damage from earlier attacks went unrepaired.|$|E
