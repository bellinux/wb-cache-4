25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply <b>wonderful,</b> <b>for</b> a while.|$|E

500|$|Anna Wintour {{attended}} the film's New York premiere, wearing Prada. Her friend Barbara Amiel {{reported that she}} said shortly afterward that the movie would go straight to DVD. But {{in an interview with}} Barbara Walters that aired the day the DVD was released, she called the film [...] "really entertaining" [...] and said she appreciated the [...] "decisive" [...] nature of Streep's portrayal. [...] "Anything that makes fashion entertaining and glamorous and interesting is <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> our industry. So I was 100 percent behind it." [...] Streep said Wintour was [...] "probably more upset by the book than the film". Anna Wintour’s popularity skyrocketed after her portrayal in The Devil Wears Prada. She was happy with the portrayal she got from Meryl Streep that did not place her in a position of complete villainy in which she felt was an unfair representation of her. [...] Meryl Streep said she did't base her character in the The Devil Wears Prada on Anna Wintour, instead saying she was inspired by men she had known previously: [...] "Unfortunately you don't have enough women in power, or at least I don't know them, to copy." ...|$|E
500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and what would make life <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> them... It's not {{an understanding of the}} head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's {{alive in the}}m... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them." [...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E
500|$|Juster {{says the}} book was rescued from the {{remainders}} table when Emily Maxwell wrote a strong review of it in The New Yorker. Maxwell wrote, [...] "As Pilgrim's Progress {{is concerned with the}} awakening of the sluggardly spirit, The Phantom Tollbooth is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind." [...] Hers was far from the only positive piece; children's author Ann McGovern reviewed it for The New York Times, writing [...] "Norton Juster's amazing fantasy has something <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> anyone old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of Alice in Wonderland and the pointed whimsy of The Wizard of Oz". John Crosby wrote for the New York Herald Tribune, [...] "In a world which sometimes seems to have gone mad, it is refreshing to pause and consider for a moment a book for children which contains a character called 'Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.' The name of the book is The Phantom Tollbooth and it was written by a bearded elf named Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, who is the cleverest of the young neurotics". Dissenting was the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, which in March 1962 deemed the book an [...] "intensive and extensive fantasy, heavily burdened with contrivance and whimsy".|$|E

2500|$|Richard Eyre calls The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, which {{features}} satyrs {{jumping out of}} box craters clog dancing, [...] "among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s". Jocelyn Herbert, famous designer of the British theatrical scene, comments that Harrison {{is aware of the}} dramatic visual impact of his ideas: [...] "The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> the stage.

2500|$|Oberman {{described}} her time on EastEnders as [...] "hectic", leading her to depart the show during December 2005. However, {{the role of}} Chrissie has remained a defining point of her career. In a recent interview, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie was such a wonderful character and the show was watched by so many people, especially the murder of Den, that it opened up doors that I never thought it would. I had some fantastic offers when I left, there was film and theatre... it was <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> me; EastEnders {{is a very good}} calling card." [...] Oberman has also recently declared her willingness to return to the part of Chrissie and EastEnders, even if only to provide a resolution for the character.|$|E
2500|$|The first section, [...] "A Miracle", {{discusses}} the popular view of Mother Teresa {{and focuses on}} the 1969 BBC documentary Something <b>Wonderful</b> <b>for</b> God which {{brought her to the}} attention of the general public and served as the basis for the book of the same title by Malcolm Muggeridge. Hitchens says that Calcutta's reputation as a place of abject poverty, [...] "a hellhole", is not deserved, but nevertheless provides a sympathetic context for Mother Teresa's work there. He quotes from conversations between Muggeridge and Mother Teresa, providing his own commentary. He quotes Muggeridge's description of [...] "the technically unaccountable light" [...] the BBC team filmed in the interior of the Home of the Dying as [...] "the first authentic photographic miracle". Hitchens contrasts this with the cameraman's statement that what Muggeridge thought was a miracle was the result of them using the latest Kodak film.|$|E

2500|$|In {{her initial}} {{days in the}} industry, Asha always played second fiddle to her elder sister. Some say that Lata had once criticised Asha's {{relationship}} with O. P. Nayyar. This widened the rift between the two sisters and O P Nayyar also {{decided that he would}} never work with Lata. O.P. Nayyar had once revealed that [...] "Asha and Lata, staying in opposite flats at Bombay's Peddar Road, shared a maid. Said maid's responsibility was to come and tell the younger sister that Lata had just recorded something <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> Asha to lose her vocal poise. Such was her Lata phobia that it took me some months to convince Asha that she had a voice individualistic enough to evolve a singing style all of her own." [...] Asha once said that she has worked for years to create a voice and a style that was different from Lata, so that she could carve her own niche and not be banished to live in her sister's shadow.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Traubner, {{writing in}} Opera News, disagrees: [...] "Ivanhoe ... {{reflects}} the ballad-rich British grand operas Sullivan grew up with, by Balfe (The Bohemian Girl) or Wallace (Maritana). The skill and flair Sullivan exhibits in the Savoy operettas in humor, gaiety and superb word-setting are barely required in Ivanhoe. It sounds instead like {{an extension of}} the hoary oratorio form popular in Victorian Britain ... with its plethora of hymn-like numbers interspersed with ballads of no particular interest and some strong ensembles." [...] Traubner continues, [...] "Sullivan's score would have been <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> a film, with its numerous Korngoldian fanfares and stirring, very English-national choruses. The long drinking scene in act 1, with its 'Glory to those who fight for the true Cross', and the 'Ho, Jolly Jenkin' ensemble with Friar Tuck, also referring to drinking, are the most exciting things in the opera. [...] Sadly, the dramatic arias required for an opera to achieve universal popularity are largely absent. ... Rebecca's prayer does have a certain Near Eastern aroma".|$|E

She’s so into music, art, she’s such a rich character {{that there are a}} lot of different things to draw on," [...] stated One Tree Hill’s costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Sometimes she’ll just be in a plaid flannel shirt because she’s painting. Some days she’ll be in a concert T-shirt. We have to find the right concert T-shirt. I do alter them a lot." [...] Cutshall would take a men’s concert T-shirt, and have Burton put it on. [...] "She’s also very, very slender, so I’ll taper them down to her figure. We come out of it with kind of a one-o-f-a-kind rock T-shirt. I take something and then turn it into my own piece of clothing," [...] said Cutshall. Peyton’s main brands have been Cheap Monday, Levi’s, some Diesel and Miss Sixty.|$|E

2500|$|Boulanger {{had as many}} as 40 {{students}} at once and employed a formal regimen that Copland had to follow. Copland found her incisive mind much to his liking and found her ability to critique a composition impeccable. Boulanger [...] "could always find the weak spot in a place you suspected was weak.... She could also tell you why it was weak [...]" [...] He {{wrote in a letter}} to his brother Ralph, [...] "This intellectual Amazon is not only professor at the Conservatoire, is not only familiar with all music from Bach to Stravinsky, but is prepared for anything worse in the way of dissonance. But make no mistake... A more charming womanly woman never lived." [...] Copland later wrote that [...] "it was <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> me to find a teacher with such openness of mind, while at the same time she held firm ideas of right and wrong in musical matters. The confidence she had in my talents and her belief in me were at the very least flattering and more—they were crucial to my development at this time of my career." [...] Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reality of}} the New South Africa is decidedly violent, and crime is a {{well-known}} theme in post-apartheid Afrikaans protest music. [...] The punk group Fokofpolisiekar (which translates to [...] "fuck off police car") sings in [...] "Brand Suid-Afrika" [...] : [...] "For you knives lie in wait, in the garden outside you house," [...] and Radio Suid-Afrika sings in [...] "Bid" [...] : [...] "Pray that no-one will be waiting in the garden, pray for strength and for mercy in each dark day." [...] Theirs is a country of [...] "murder and child rape" [...] where the only respite is alcohol abuse. [...] In [...] "Blaas hom" [...] by the industrial band Battery9, the narrator sings how he gleefully unloads his gun on a burglar after being robbed for the third time, and in [...] "Siek bliksems" [...] Kristoe Strauss asks God to help against the [...] "sick bastards" [...] responsible for hijackings. The metal band KOBUS! pleads for a reinstatement {{of the death penalty}} in [...] "Doodstraf", because they feel the promise of peace has not been realized. In [...] "Reconciliation Day", Koos Kombuis sings: [...] "Our streets run with blood, every day a funeral procession, they steal all our goods, on Reconciliation Day." [...] Elsewhere he states, [...] "we're in a state of war." [...] The video of this song features a lawless microcosm of theft, rape and abuse – a lawlessness reflected in Valiant Swart's [...] "Sodom en Gomorra": [...] "two cities in the north, without laws, without order, too <b>wonderful</b> <b>for</b> words." [...] Hanru Niemand rewrites the traditional Afrikaans song Sarie Marais, turning it into a murder ballad speculating on where Sarie's body will be found. [...] The new protest musicians also parody Voëlvry's music: Johannes Kerkorrel's [...] "Sit dit af" [...] – a satire on P. W. Botha of the apartheid regime – is turned into [...] "Sit dit aan" [...] by Koos Kombuis, now a song protesting mismanagement resulting in chronic power failures.|$|E
