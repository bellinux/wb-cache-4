25|$|In September 1828, the Conference of Poros {{opened to}} discuss <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> borders of Greece. On 21 December 1828, the ambassadors of Britain, Russia, and France {{met on the}} island of Poros, and {{prepared}} a protocol, which provided for the creation of an autonomous state ruled by a monarch, whose authority should be confirmed by a firman of the Sultan. The proposed borderline ran from Arta to Volos, and, despite Kapodistrias' efforts, the new state would include only the islands of the Cyclades, the Sporades, Samos, and maybe Crete. The Sublime Porte, which had rejected the call for an armistice in 1827, now rejected the conclusions of the Poros conference, with the Sultan Mahmud II saying he would never grant Greece independence, and the war would go on until he reconquered all of Greece. Based on the Protocol of Poros, the London Conference agreed on the protocol of 22 March 1829, which accepted most of the ambassadors' proposals, but drew the borders farther south than the initial proposal, and did not include Samos and Crete in the new state.|$|E

[...] The verdict said that statements of witnesses recorded by the Gujarat police were [...] "unreliable as the investigator's propriety in recording the statements had itself been rebutted." [...] The special court judge also criticised Mysorewala's actions in investigation, and said that [...] "Mysorewala and his force were totally inactive on all fronts and in every aspect." [...] The court added that: [...] "No doubt, it was an elephantine task to investigate the kind of crimes, but then it cannot be believed that the senior Investigating Officers, having experience, do not know <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> priorities in such kind of investigation.
