M/S academic sexism was based on girls’ reported experiences hearing sexist comments about girls’ abilities in math and science. Older European American adolescents, and both younger and older Latina adolescents, <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> several instances of academic sexism felt less competent in M/S than girls <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> less sexism (controlling for M/S grades).

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey of 108 randomly selected menopausal {{women in the}} Lagos metropolis (Nigeria) was undertaken. They were requested to report on any menopausal symptoms experienced, age at menarche and menopause, present ages and marital status. The most common menopausal symptoms reported were hot flushes (83. 7 %) and vaginal dryness (49. 0 %). Psychosomatic symptoms included irritability, insomnia, dizziness and depression. Most respondents reported mild or moderate severity of the <b>experienced</b> symptoms. Respondents <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> depression were observed to have started menstruation at a statistically younger age (mean 12. 4 years) than those <b>who</b> did not <b>experience</b> it (mean 14. 9 years). On the other hand respondents <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> insomnia started menstruation at a statistically older age (mean 15. 8 years) than those <b>who</b> did not <b>experience</b> it (14. 1 years). For irritability and dizziness there was no statistical difference in age at menarche between those <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> the symptoms {{and those who did}} not. The present study also revealed that age at the onset of menopause did not differ in those <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> and those <b>who</b> did not <b>experience</b> depression, insomnia and irritability. However there was a statistical difference in age at menopause between respondents <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> dizziness and those who did not, with the mean age being higher (52. 6 years) in respondents <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> it. There appears to be no strong patterned correlation between age at menarche and at menopause and psychosomatic menopausal experiences. Age at the onstart of menstruation and onset of menopause may not play a deciding role in the experience of most psychosomatic menopausal symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Most {{research}} on {{the negative impact of}} restructuring on employees’ health considers restructuring involving personnel reduction. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the assumption that the type of restructuring, business expansion versus restructuring not involving expansion (only reductions and/or change of ownership), influences its psychological responses: appraisal of the change, psychosocial working conditions and well-being after the change. Material and Methods: The study was carried out among 857 employees that experienced restructuring in 2009 and/or 2010 and 538 employees from companies not restructured at that time. The main variables, i. e., assessment of change in terms of personal benefits and losses, psychosocial job characteristics and well-being were measured using a questionnaire developed in “The psychological health and well-being in restructuring: key effects and mechanisms” project (PSYRES). Results: It was found that the employees <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> business expansion in comparison to those <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> exclusively change of ownership had a higher appraisal of change, while those <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> restructuring not involving business expansion did not differ from those <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> change of ownership. As far as psychosocial working conditions are concerned, those employees <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> exclusively business expansion did not differ from those in the not restructured companies (except for quantitative demands that were higher), while most psychosocial working conditions of the employees <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> restructuring not involving expansion were poorer than in the not restructured companies. Also, well-being measures of the employees <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> exclusively business expansion did not differ from those in the not restructured companies (except for innovative behavior that was even higher), while well-being measure of those <b>who</b> <b>experienced</b> restructuring not involving expansion was poorer than of those in the not restructured companies. Conclusions: Restructuring involving exclusively business expansion is not a threat to psychosocial job characteristics (except for quantitative demands) or to employees’ well-being. Therefore, the type of restructuring should be taken into account when the restructuring – psychological health relationship is discussed...|$|R

5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people <b>who</b> <b>experience</b> multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.

5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people <b>who</b> <b>experience</b> pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women <b>who</b> <b>experience</b> vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to}} have thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall.

Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E

5|$|Berry was {{appointed}} Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001. At the Interior Department, Berry improved credit union and continuing education options, oversaw {{the expansion of}} department programs to improve employees' work-life balance, and held town hall meetings with Interior employees and used their suggestions to upgrade a cafeteria and health center. These changes were partly funded through partnerships with federal employees, unions and other agencies to reduce costs for the department. Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees <b>who</b> <b>experience</b> discrimination because of their sexual orientation, to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards.

5|$|Pound {{began work}} on The Cantos in earnest after {{relocating}} to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those <b>who</b> <b>experience</b> a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to paradiso terrestre. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922. The first three appear in Poetry in June–August 1917. The Malatesta Cantos appeared in The Criterion in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in The Transatlantic Review in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those <b>who</b> <b>experience</b> too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
