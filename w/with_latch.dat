40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the limitation of a narrow frequency range of conventional resonant clocking, intermittent resonant clocking (IRC) is proposed for near/sub-threshold logic circuits. In this paper, IRC is applied to 0. 37 V 32 -bit adder array <b>with</b> <b>latches</b> and adder array with flip-flops fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS process. Measurement results show that IRC reduces the clock power by 36 % at 980 kHz and the clock leakage power by 81 % compared with conventional non-resonant clocking when IRC {{is applied to the}} adder array <b>with</b> <b>latches.</b> The same power reduction is achieved when IRC is applied to the adder array with flip-flops. IRC can reduce the clock power at any clock frequency, which enables flexible selection of the clock frequency.

40|$|The main aim is {{to reduce}} area and power by {{replacing}} pulsed <b>latches</b> <b>with</b> dual edge <b>latch.</b> The average power, static power and dynamic power are reduced by dual edge latch. Dual edge <b>latch</b> is combined <b>with</b> inverter coupling circuit. It has MN 1 and MN 2 as 2 NMOS transistor for dual edge latch. The circuit having input as D, Db and output as Q, Qb. When clock is “set” MN 1, MN 2 both turns “ON”, If clock is “RESET ” MN 1, MN 2 turns “OFF”. This dual edge latch consumes less static current and power delay product than shift register <b>with</b> pulsed <b>latches.</b> It {{can be used to}} design Successive Approximation Ratio (SAR) and Comparator. Power also reduced and also it uses less amount of transistor than shift register <b>with</b> pulsed <b>latches.</b> It consumes 67 % power and 46 % area when compared to shift register <b>with</b> pulsed <b>latches...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} years of {{relative}} happiness follow. Jack, now in his teens, can be sent off to school, and Esther even has her own servant. But Latch is a gambler, and nothing can stop him from risking most of the money he has in the vague hope of gaining even more. Illegal betting is conducted in an upstairs private bar, but more and more also across the counter, until the police clamp down on his activities, his licence is revoked, and he has to pay a heavy fine. This coincides <b>with</b> <b>Latch</b> developing a chronic, sometimes bloody, cough, contracting pneumonia, and finally, in his mid-thirties, being diagnosed with tuberculosis ("consumption"). However, rather than not touching what little money he still has for his wife and son's sake, the dying man puts everything on one horse, loses, and dies a few days later.|$|E

After Latch and his lover have eloped together, Esther stays on at Woodview until she cannot hide her {{pregnancy}} any longer. Although she has found a kindred soul in Mrs Barfield, who is also a Plymouth Sister and abhors the betting on horses going on all around her, Esther is dismissed ("I couldn't have kept you on, on account of the bad example to the younger servants") and reluctantly goes back to London.|$|E
40|$|Conventionally, when a {{synchronous}} {{sequential circuit}} is synthesized, storage units are implemented in either edgetriggered flip-flops or level-sensitive latches, but not both, {{depending on the}} clocking scheme (one- or two-phase) used. We propose that, in the former case, some of the flip-flops can be replaced <b>with</b> <b>latches.</b> Since a latch is generally smaller, faster and less power-consuming than a flip-flop, this replacement leads to improvements in circuit area, performance and power consumption. Whether a flip-flop can be replaced <b>with</b> a <b>latch</b> depends on not only its structural context but also its temporal behavior. In this paper, we first present conditions under which a straightforward replacement can be made; then, we propose two retiming-based transformations that {{increase the number of}} replaceable flip-flops. We have implemented the proposed idea in a software called FF 2 Latch. Experimental results on a set of control-dominated circuits from the high-level synthesis benchmark set [1] show {{that a large number of}} the flipflops can be replaced <b>with</b> <b>latches.</b> Up to 22 % reduction in the circuit area and up to 73 % reduction in the power consumption have been achieved...|$|R

While working there, she makes the acquaintance of Fred Parsons, a Plymouth Brother and political agitator, who proposes to Esther {{at about the same}} time she bumps into William Latch again while on an errand for her mistress. Latch, who has amassed a small fortune betting on horses and as a bookmaker ("I am worth to-day close on three thousand pounds"), is the proprietor of a licensed public house in Soho and has separated from his adulterous wife, waiting for his marriage to be divorced. He immediately declares his unceasing love for Esther and urges her to live with him and work behind the bar of his pub. Esther realises that she has arrived at a crossroads and that she must make up her mind between the sheltered, serene and religious life Parsons is offering her—which she is really longing for—and sharing the financially secure but turbulent existence of a successful small-time entrepreneur who, as she soon finds out, operates on both sides of the law.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if vehicle features associated <b>with</b> <b>LATCH</b> ease-of-use in laboratory studies with volunteers predict LATCH use and misuse in real-world child restraint installations. Methods: Vehicle characteristics were extracted from prior surveys of more than 100 top-selling 2010 - 13 vehicles.

40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} how CRS features, labels, and instructions contribute to CRS installation errors. Task 1 A focused on assessing different physical features of 16 convertible CRS, while Task 1 B evaluated baseline and modified versions of labels and instructions for two CRS models. For each phase of testing, 32 subjects were recruited based on their education level (high or low) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in a 2006 Pontiac G 6 sedan. An 18 -month-old CRABI anthropometric test device (ATD) weighing 25 lb was used for all installations. Each subject installed two CRS forward-facing (FF), one <b>with</b> <b>LATCH</b> and one with seatbelt, and two CRS rear-facing (RF), one <b>with</b> <b>LATCH</b> and one with the seatbelt. For Task 1 A, each subject installed four of the sixteen convertible CRS. For Task 1 B, each subject installed a Graco ComfortSport and Evenflo Titan twice, where each CRS had one of eight alternate instruction manuals and one of eight alternate label conditions. After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 42 factors for each installation, such as choice of belt routing path, tightness of installation, and harness snugness. Analyses used linear mixed models to identify CRS installation outcomes associated with CRS features or label/ instruction type. LATCH connector type, LATCH belt adjustor type, {{and the presence of}} belt lockoffs are associated with the tightness of the CRS installation. The type of harness shoulder height adjuster is associated with the rate of achieving a snug harness. Correct tether use is associated with the tether storage method. In general, subject assessments of the ease of use of CRS features are not highly correlated with the quality of their installation, suggesting a need for feedback with incorrect installations. The results of testing alternative labels and instructions indicate that no alternative condition significantly improved CRS installation compared to baseline conditions across all potential installation errors that were evaluated. An unintended consequence of using “combined” labels (incorporating all of the variations recommended by human factors experts that were tested individually in other conditions) is that subjects were less likely to use the CRS manual. The most promising alternative manual is a video version. Neither the labels nor manuals with improved graphics showed substantial benefit compared to baseline, even though graphics-based manuals and labels score well using the ISO and NHTSA ease-of-use rating system. The effects of varying labels and manuals on installation error are small compared to the effects of different CRS designs. The data from this study provide quantitative assessments of some CRS features that are associated with reductions in CRS installation errors. This information can be used to update the NHTSA CRS ease-of-use rating system to account for recently developed CRS features. Based on human factors recommendations, suggestions are made for assessing “clear” labels and instructions and modifying FMVSS 213 requirements to facilitate clearer labels and instructions...|$|E
