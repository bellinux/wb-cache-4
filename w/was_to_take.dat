5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was split}} into two parts. The first group, composed of around eight hundred colonial troops and led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the main road towards Rejaf and engage the rebels openly. The second, under Belgian war hero Baron Dhanis, was a much larger force of over three-thousand men, mostly natives from the Tetela ethnic group, and <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a treacherous path through the jungle to the north. Both expeditions left for the Lado Enclave in December 1896.|$|E

This ferry only runs during the summer months. The second way <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> your own boat/kayak/canoe over.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, a {{government}} committee concluded that building more roads encourages more traffic {{and that the}} way to ease congestion and pollution <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> measures to control car use rather than accommodate more.

5|$|On January 31, 2011, Huntsman {{submitted}} {{his formal}} resignation {{from his post}} as U.S. Ambassador to China. The resignation <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> effect April 30, 2011, and Huntsman indicated his {{plans to return to}} the United States by May 2011. This move spurred further widespread speculation of Huntsman making a 2012 Republican presidential bid.|$|E
5|$|After the massacre, General Henry Atkinson was {{informed}} that Dodge <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over General Alexander Posey's brigade at Fort Hamilton. While Dodge {{was on his way}} to visit the brigade, he heard a rifle shot from a group of Native Americans. Dodge quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men as he could to pursue the enemy. With Dodge in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 25 Native warriors criss-crossed the Pecatonica River until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the Battle of Pecatonica.|$|E

5|$|Armada of the Damned was {{conceived}} as an action-adventure role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective {{and set in}} an open world environment based on the Pirates of the Caribbean universe. The player <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the role of James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the Caribbean Sea and make a reputation for himself. Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although Armada of the Damned was centered on a choice system that would affect the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.|$|E
5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E
5|$|By late May 1942, {{responsibility}} for the defence of Fiji shifted to the United States with a division arriving in the country. The 148th Infantry Regiment <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over {{the positions of the}} 14th Brigade. While the 30th and 35th Battalions began packing and left the area by late June, the 37th had to wait until more American forces arrived. It was not until 5 August that the battalion boarded the American troopship President Coolidge and departed five days later. The battalion reached Auckland on 13 August and proceeded to Pukekohe where a camp had been established. After a few days, the battalion personnel went on leave for two weeks.|$|E

5|$|By mid-December 1963, Indonesian {{had sent}} a {{commando}} unit consisting of 128 volunteers and 35 regular soldiers to Sebatik. Their aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Kalabakan, then invade Tawau and Sandakan. On 29 December 1963, the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit. The Indonesians managed to throw several grenades into the totally unprepared Malay Regiment's sleeping quarters. The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers being killed and nineteen wounded. Malaysian armed police eventually drove the attackers north after a two-hour battle.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Sophia's birth, Briggs had {{achieved}} a high standing within his profession. Nevertheless, he considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also grown tired of the wandering life. They did not proceed with this project, but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver in Julia A. Hallock, and Benjamin in Mary Celeste. In October 1872, Benjamin took command of Mary Celeste for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her to Genoa in Italy. He arranged {{for his wife and}} infant daughter to accompany him, while his school-aged son was left at home with his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Clerici {{also wrote}} several scenes {{that did not}} make the film's final cut. One of which {{depicted}} a group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in the river. This scene <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film this scene, but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{attempts}} {{to take the}} crippled Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff, the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned. A few minutes after 6:00am Szent István sank. Admiral Horthy, commander of the proposed attack, soon canceled the attack because {{he thought that the}} Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola. On the contrary, the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. This was the last military operation that the Viribus Unitis <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in and she spent the rest of her career at port in Pola.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} in the ground in September 1958. The supporters' association raised the £15,000 cost of the new lights. When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961, {{one of his many}} influential changes <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the lights, playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|For the new attack, Nelson <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> three {{ships of}} the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, {{a combination of}} strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E

Birdwood <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the corps to France, and on 28 March 1916, he exchanged commands with Godley, who took over II ANZAC Corps.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} months, Johnson flew as a night fighter pilot. Using day fighters {{to act as}} night fighters without radar was largely {{unsuccessful}} in intercepting German bombers during The Blitz; Johnson's only action occurred on 22 February 1941 when he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Spitfire R6611, QJ-F. A week later, Johnson's squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast. Johnson was eager to see combat after just 10.40 operational hours and welcomed the prospect of meeting the enemy from Tangmere. If the Germans did not resume their assault the Wing <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the fight to them.|$|E
