25|$|Concerns {{are being}} raised about the metal {{sensitivity}} and potential dangers of metal particulate debris. New publications have demonstrated development of pseudotumors, soft tissue masses containing necrotic tissue, around the hip joint. It appears these masses are more common in women and these patients show {{a higher level of}} iron in the blood. The cause is unknown and is probably multifactorial. There may be a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal <b>wear</b> <b>debris</b> or a hypersensitivity reaction to a normal amount of metal debris.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene <b>wear</b> <b>debris,</b> fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic <b>wear</b> <b>debris</b> given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E
25|$|To combat {{loosening}} {{caused by}} polyethylene <b>wear</b> <b>debris,</b> hip manufacturers developed improved and novel {{materials for the}} acetabular liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE {{was introduced in the}} late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.|$|E

30|$|A {{major cause}} of {{artificial}} joint failure is the loosening that occurs {{as a consequence of}} wear and tear of the bearing surfaces. Even a well performing prosthetic joint releases billions of microscopic <b>wear</b> particles (<b>debris)</b> into the joint space. When an excessive amount of debris is generated it may stimulate a severe body reaction in the capsular tissues and bone leading to inflammation and osteolysis. The resulting loss of supporting bone may lead to loosening of the implants requiring difficult revision surgery.|$|R
2500|$|The {{articular}} interface is {{not part}} of either implant, rather it is the area between the acetabular cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and socket joint.

The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are , [...] and [...] While [...] was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>wear</b> <b>debris</b> generated by friction.

40|$|Fretting wear is the {{material}} damage of two contact surfaces caused by micro relative displacement. Its characteristic is that debris is trapped on the contact surfaces. Depending on {{the material}} properties, {{the shapes of the}} debris, and the dominant <b>wear</b> mechanisms, <b>debris</b> can play different roles that either protect or harm interfaces. Due to the micro scale of the debris, it is difficult to obtain instantaneous information and investigate debris behavior in experiments. The Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to model the process of fretting wear and calculate contact variables, such as contact stress and relative slip during the fretting wear process. In this research, a 2 D fretting wear model with a debris layer was developed to investigate the influence of <b>debris</b> on fretting <b>wear.</b> Effects of different factors such as thickness of the debris layer, Young’s modulus of the debris layer, and the time of importing the layer into the FE model were considered in this study. Based on FE results, here we report that: (a) the effect of Young’s modulus of the debris layer on the contact pressure is not significant; (b) the contact pressure between the debris layer and the flat specimen decreases with increasing thickness of the layer and (c) by importing the debris layer in different fretting <b>wear</b> cycles, the <b>debris</b> layer shows different roles in the wear process. At the beginning of the <b>wear</b> cycle, the <b>debris</b> layer protects the contact surfaces of the first bodies (cylindrical pad and flat specimen).

Currently joint replacements are expected to function for 10 – 15 years, however, with an increase in life expectancy, and a greater call for all types of joint replacement due to increased activity levels, there is a requirement to improve their function to offer longer term improved quality of life for patients.

40|$|Introduction: Risk {{factors for}} dislocations of a hip {{arthroplasty}} were already determined {{in a vast}} number of published studies. Contemporary, only a few of them compared primary and secondary dislocations after primary or revision surgery concerning patient-, indication- and sugery-related risk factors. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} identify risk factors concerning patient, indication and sur-gery in order to evaluate primary dislocations and correlate with secondary dislocation. Method: A retrospective analysis for dislocations was performed for all hip arthroplasties treated in our hospital between 2007 and 2011. A total number of 104 patients without indi-cation for surgical revision were included and treated with close reduction. The cohort was divided in two groups depending on the effort of the therapy. Group I (n = 30) included pa-tients without a redislocation in contrast to group II (n = 74), which included patients with a secondary dislocation of the hip arthroplasty. Results: The average age in which the first dislocation occurred, was 68 years ± 14 years (32 % male and 68 % female). Redislocations were documented in 74 cases (71 %). The primary dislocation after hip arthroplasty in group I was with 37 days ± 20 days significantly later compared to the average value of 18 days ± 21 days in group II (p = 0, 025). Furthermore group II showed a higher BMI than group I (27, 11 kg/m 2 ± 6, 24 kg/m 2 vs. 24, 49 kg/m 2 ± 5, 02 kg/m 2; p = 0, 035). Also, in group I (n = 22 of 30) more cases of hip diseases of the con-tralateral site were detected compared to group II (n = 32 of 74; p = 0, 005). In group I the the cup’s angle of anteversion was higher than in group II (20, 20 ° ± 7, 53 ° vs. 14, 55 ° ± 9, 59 °; p = 0, 020). There was no significant difference between other risk factors with respect to the risk of redislocation. Summary: An early dislocation had a higher risk of a secondary dislocation than a late first event. A high BMI, the absence of contralateral hip disease and a less anteversion of the cup correlates significantly with a greater risk of redislocation of a hip arthroplasty after primary or revision surgery. We suggest to continue the conservative treatment after first dislocation with a more limited of range of motion in cases of dislocations below 20 days after the oper-ation or a BMI over 25 kg/m 2.
