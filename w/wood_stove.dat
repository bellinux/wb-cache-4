5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a <b>wood</b> <b>stove</b> and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E

25|$|The Ueschinen Hut is {{situated}} in the Ueschinen Valley, at a height of 1,890metres, and about two to three hours' {{walk away from the}} centre. It is usually open from May to October. During the summer it is used mainly as a base for climbing and hiking activities, but it may be used by groups at any time if weather allows. The hut is actually half of a cowshed, so sometimes it is a bit noisy at night. It can sleep up to 30 people and has a fully equipped kitchen with <b>wood</b> <b>stove,</b> a general living and eating room and a special toilet– there is no electricity and no shower.|$|E
50|$|The United States Clean Air Act {{requires}} that <b>wood</b> <b>stoves</b> be {{certified by the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

However, the EPA has had no mandatory emission limits for pellet stoves, indoor or outdoor <b>wood</b> boilers, masonry <b>stoves</b> and certain types of <b>wood</b> <b>stoves</b> that are exempt from EPA regulation. EPA is developing new regulations and in 2015, these will begin to come into effect, establishing mandatory emission limits for almost all wood-burning appliances (fireplaces, chimeneas, and some other special appliances will still be exempt).|$|R

60|$|The curtain {{went up and}} Cyrus {{rubbed his}} eyes. He had {{certainly}} braced his nerves to behold some mystery of iniquity; instead he saw an old kitchen so like his own at home that it bewildered him; and there, sitting by the cheery <b>wood</b> <b>stove,</b> in homespun gown, with primly braided hair, was Joscelyn--his girl Josie, as {{he had seen her}} a thousand times by his own ingle-side. The building rang with applause; one old man pulled out a red bandanna and wiped tears of joy and pride from his eyes. She hadn't changed--Josie hadn't changed. Play-acting hadn't spoiled her--couldn't spoil her. Wasn't she Paul's daughter! And all this applause was for her--for Josie.|$|E
60|$|She came {{often to}} the post to trade. And often she sat by the big <b>wood</b> <b>stove</b> and chatted in broken English with Neil Bonner.

Sometimes he stopped to think, {{and then she was}} met coldly, with a resolve that perplexed and piqued her, and which, she was convinced, was not sincere. But more often he did not dare to think, and then all went well and there were smiles and laughter. And Amos Pentley, gasping like a {{stranded}} catfish, his hollow cough a-reek with the grave, looked upon it all and grinned. He, who loved life, could not live, and it rankled his soul that others should be able to live. Wherefore he hated Bonner, who was so very much alive and into whose eyes sprang joy at the sight of Jees Uck. As for Amos, the very thought of the girl was sufficient to send his blood pounding up into a hemorrhage.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to characterise {{particle}} emissions from pellets stoves and modern and old-type residential <b>wood</b> <b>stoves.</b> The mass concentration of particulate material in the hot flue gas was 19 e 82 mg/MJ, roughly the same for <b>wood</b> <b>stoves</b> and pellets stoves, but the old-type <b>wood</b> <b>stoves</b> tended to emit even higher quantities. Furthermore, during combustion of wood logs the considerably higher emission of organic gaseous carbon indicates an additional contribution to the emission from secondarily formed condensable organic particles. The particle mass emitted was dominated by fine particles (< 1 mm) in all cases. The fine particle maximum was displaced towards larger size during inefficient combustion, e. g. during the start-up phase. The number concentration of particles from <b>wood</b> <b>stoves</b> was 1. 0 $ 1014 e 6. 0 $ 1014 #/MJ, from pellets 3. 0 $ 1013 e 5. 0 $ 1013 #/MJ, and in all cases dominated by fine particles. Efficient combustion of pellets resulted mainly in inorganic particles, dominated by potassium sulphate and potassium chloride. Zinc, the second most frequent metal, and calcium showed the highest concentrations among the less volatile components. The lowest concentration detected was for cadmium, about 105 times lower than for potassium...|$|R

60|$|No {{doubt they}} were an unruly set of boys, and I do not suppose the teacher was a hard man, though he led {{the life of an}} executioner, and seldom passed a day without inflicting pain that a fiend might shrink from giving. My boy lived in an anguish of fear lest somehow he should come under that rod of his; but he was rather fond of the teacher, and so were all the boys. The teacher took a real {{interest}} in their studies, and if he whipped them well, he taught them well; and at most times he was kind and friendly with them. Anyway, he did not blister your hand with a ruler, as some teachers did, or make you stand bent forward from the middle, with your head hanging down, so that the blood all ran into it. Under him my boy made great advances in reading and writing, and he won some distinction in declamation; but the old difficulties with the arithmetic remained. He failed to make anything out of the parts of speech in his grammar; but one afternoon, while he sat in his stocking feet, trying to ease the chilblains which every boy used to have from his snow-soaked boots, before the days of india-rubbers, he found something {{in the back of his}} grammar which made him forget all about the pain. This was a part called Prosody, and it told how to make verses; explained the feet, the accents, the stanzas--everything that had puzzled him in his attempts to imitate the poems he had heard his father read aloud. He was amazed; he had never imagined that such a science existed, and yet here it was printed out, with each principle reduced to practice. He conceived of its reasons at the first reading, so that I suppose nature had not dealt so charily with him concerning the rules of prosody as the rules of arithmetic; and he lost no time in applying them in a poem of his own. The afternoon air was heavy with the heat that quivered visibly above the great cast-iron <b>wood</b> <b>stove</b> in the centre of the schoolroom; the boys drowsed in their seats, or hummed sleepily over their lessons; the chilblains gnawed away at the poet's feet, but heaven had opened to him, and he was rapt far from all the world of sense. The music which he had followed through those poems his father read was no longer a mystery; he had its key, its secret; he might hope to wield its charm, to lay its spell upon others. He wrote his poem, which was probably a simple, unconscious imitation of something that had pleased him in his school-reader, and carried it proudly home with him. But here he met with that sort of disappointment which more than any other dismays and baffles authorship; a difference in the point of view. His father said the verses were well made, and he sympathized with him in his delight at having found out the way to make them, though he was not so much astonished as the boy that such a science as prosody should exist. He praised the child's work, and no doubt smiled at it with the mother; but he said that the poem spoke of heaven as a place in the sky, and he wished him always to realize that heaven was a state and not a place, and that we could have it in this world as well as the next. The boy promised that he would try to realize heaven as a state; but at the bottom of his heart he despaired of getting that idea into poetry. Everybody else who had made poetry spoke of heaven as a place; they even called it a land, and put it in the sky; and he did not see how he was to do otherwise, no matter what Swedenborg said. He revered Swedenborg; he had a religious awe of the seer's lithograph portrait in a full-bottom wig which hung in the front-room, but he did not see how even Swedenborg could have helped calling heaven a place if he had been making poetry.|$|E
