The storm re-intensified into a hurricane over the western Atlantic Ocean, and its outer rainbands dropped heavy rainfall in Wilmington, North Carolina.

5|$|During {{the late}} morning of June25, Celia started rapidly {{weakening}} {{as it began}} {{to take a more}} northwesterly track into a more hostile environment, with cooler <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> and higher wind shear; all of these conditions are highly unfavorable for tropical cyclones. By June26, convection associated with the hurricane had substantially lessened and cloud tops warmed. The storm also began to resume a westward track as it moved into an area of weaker steering currents. Traversing <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> estimated at , Celia continued to degenerate as it weakened to tropical storm status, by which time it was situated about 955mi (1,535km) southeast of the southern tip of Baja California Sur. Most of the convection associated with the system had dissipated and the center of circulation became exposed, with a small area of showers and thunderstorms to the north. Throughout June27, the system gradually lost its forward momentum over the open water of the Pacific Ocean but managed to maintain minimal tropical storm status longer than initially anticipated.|$|E

The research of objectives are to study effects of <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> irrigated to media and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> sprayed to the leaves on Chili seedling growth.

The factor studied were <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> for <b>watering</b> media and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> for spraying seedling leaves. The result showed that <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> for spraying seedling leaves significantly affected all variables observed, including seedling height, seedling diameter, leaf size, wet weight of seedling, wet weight of the roots, dried weigh of seedling, and dried weigh of the roots. <b>Water</b> <b>temperature</b> for <b>watering</b> media did not significantly affect all variables observed. There were significant interactions between <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> for <b>watering</b> media and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> for spraying seedling leaves on seedling diameter and leaf size. <b>Water</b> <b>temperature</b> of 120 C for watering media in combination with normal <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> for spraying seedling leaves was the best treatment combination, while <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> of 120 C for watering media in combination with 120 C <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> for spraying seedling leaves was the worst treatment...|$|R

5|$|The cyclone {{weakened}} {{while remaining}} nearly stationary, losing {{most of its}} deep convection due to upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. It remained nearly stationary until beginning a steady south-southwestward motion late on February 26, a change due to an approaching mid-level trough to its south. On February 28, convection increased around a rebuilding eyewall as it accelerated southward, though on March 1 the cyclone again weakened as wind shear increased and as <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> gradually decreased. Gamede weakened to tropical storm status as its center became exposed from the deep convection, and late on March 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. After completing the transition, the storm became nearly stationary for about two days, during which its winds decreased to below gale force. The remnants of Gamede turned westward and persisted until dissipating on March 6.|$|E

40|$|As the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was {{considered}} to be a very important problem to be dealt with in relation to the causes of low productivity of second crop of paddy rice on Okinawa, the influence of high <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> to it was tested. The relationship between high <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> and the growth of rice plant was already reported in the previous publication. Then the infuence of high <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> to a yield of paddy rice was dealt in this paper. The results are as follows: 1. Both culm length and panicle length were dipressed by high <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> especially by that of night. The influence of difference <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> to the weights of a panicle and of panicles per hill was clearly observed (Table 1). 2. Not only weight of a panicle but also a number of panicles per hill were decreased for the plots where <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was kept high during night. This, in turn, resulted the increase in weight of panicles per hill (Table 1). 3. The high <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> at night affected to decrease both the rachis of second order and the number of grains attached to top of them (Table 2. Fig. 1). This attributed a decrease in grain number per panicle. Since the number of panicles was also decreased with the high <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> at night, total grains per hill were small in number. 4. The percentage of sterile and defective grains was high in the plots where <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was kept high at night, while it was remarkable low in the plots where <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied between day and night (Table 1). 5.
