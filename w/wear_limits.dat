40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic methodology to estimate allowable limits for rail head wear {{in terms of}} vertical head-height loss, gage-face side wear, and/or {{the combination of the}} two. This methodology is based on the principles of engineering fracture mechanics. The concept of applying the principles of engineering fracture mechanics to examine structural integrity was originally introduced by the U. S. Air Force, and is now embraced by the commercial aircraft industry. Aircraft structures are based on fracture mechanics (also referred to as damage tolerance) principles. Moreover, the approach in conducting rail integrity research sponsored by the Government is based on damage tolerance principles. The fracture mechanics methodology to estimate rail head <b>wear</b> <b>limits</b> is based on various assumptions regarding operational and environmental factors. These factors include rail size, foundation modulus, temperature difference, train speed, and rail test interval (i. e. tonnage between rail tests). This paper describes the methodology based on engineering fracture mechanics to estimate rail <b>wear</b> <b>limits.</b> In addition, results and sensitivity studies from applying the methodology are presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the potential risk of fatigue damage at the rail underhead radius (UHR) due to the occurrence of a short duration tensile stress peak, as a wheel passes over, has been examined. The tensile stress peak is mainly due to the localised bending of the rail head-on-web and its magnitude {{is associated with the}} contact position, lateral and vertical forces and rail head wear (HW). The stresses at the underhead radius have been explored using the finite element method (FEM). The Dang Van (DV) criterion, implemented as a customised computer programme, was used to identify the fatigue damage at the UHR. Fatigue behaviour under heavy haul conditions was compared for heat-treated low alloy, euctectoid and hypereutectoid rail grades in order to predict allowable rail head <b>wear</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|E

The result of the simulation is a frequency distribution of failures as a function of preflight acceptance limits.

SVM is used to relate the wear rate and technological parameters of the wear resistant drip moulding.

The authors show how simulation tools, measurement and data analytics can be applied to give significant improvements in asset management. The authors experience ranges from legacy lightrail, through new build to modern metro systems enabling them to provide practical examples of the range of techniques discussed. Previous work, conducted on-behalf of ORR, UKTram and EU research projects, has demonstrated the variation in wheel-rail profiles, rail steel grades and maintenance limits (e. g. wheel-rail wear) adopted by UK and International light-rail systems. Optimising the selection of these parameters can provide significant benefits and costs for light-rail systems through; (a) maximising the life of the rail and reduction in premature rail replacement, (b) improved planning of maintenance and renewals, (c) reduction in carbon footprint and (d) reduction in disruption to passenger service. Results from current UKTram ‘low impact light-rail’ project will be summarised along with observations from the completed EU research project PM’n’IDEA. This will include examples of how effective management of the wheel-rail interface and the use of simulation tools can lead to optimal selection rail <b>wear</b> <b>limits</b> and rail steel grade...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 41 Monitoring {{vibration}} as a {{predictive maintenance}} tool will not consistently prevent catastrophic damage and/or fluid release from sealess pumps. When vibration readings are taken periodically, a pump may be destroyed between monitoring schedules. Using acceleration {{to monitor the}} internal rotor of a sealess pump does not {{work as well as}} it does on a sealed pump configuration. There are several reasons for this. First, the internal rotor mass is relatively low when compared {{to the rest of the}} pump. The external mass dampens the vibration signal and a clear interpretation is not always possible. Second, vibration generated by inconsistent fluid flow during abnormal operating conditions can create confusing vibration amplitudes. Thirds, sealess pumps are relatively new and experience with vibration interpretation is limited. Monitoring sealess pumps by means other than vibration are generally reactionary, such as indicating the presence of liquid where none should be or detecting the conditions that will result in internal rotor damage. Also, some devices that monitor internal rotor condition create an additional leak path from the pump to atmosphere. Internal rotor monitoring methods generally rely on ?wearing through something? to create a signal that is detectable outside of the pump. The signal is representative of the remaining bearing life. These methods are not effective unless the internal pump wear is uniform over time. This uniformity is often lacking, because the process fluid cools and lubricates the inside of the pump and periods to reach <b>wear</b> <b>limits</b> often vary. All of the wear could have taken place in the last hour, even if the pump has been running for the last 12 months...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, UK {{heritage}} railways carried 7. {{1 million}} passengers on over 530 miles of track, accounting for £ 92 million of direct revenue. Much {{of this operation}} uses steam locomotives with relatively high axle loads and reciprocating motion {{which can lead to}} uneven track loading. However the majority of track components on heritage lines are antiquated due to reliance on cascaded components and in some cases on the deliberate retention of chaired bullhead rail for conservational purposes. This research provides an assessment of current methodologies regarding the management of steel rails on heritage railways: the measurement of rail wear, the assessment of the residual strength in worn rails and the subsequent determination of a rail’s critical wear limit. It describes the effectiveness and adequacy of some of the inspection regimes in use and addresses the risks associated with the variation in these regimes across the sector. A survey of permanent way supervisors on UK standard gauge heritage lines is reported and the permanent way in use is and the perceived requirements for its renewal are summarised. Due to low speeds and traffic levels, the main line standards for rail wear are generally thought to be inappropriate for heritage railway use whilst ‘high-tech’ methods for measuring crack propagation and rail wear are inaccessible due to cost. A common approach is to employ inspection and maintenance regimes developed by British Rail for use on rural lines. Utilising a fracture mechanics approach to predicting rail failure developed in the USA, the research highlights a more relevant set of guidelines, providing a matrix detailing acceptable <b>wear</b> <b>limits</b> based on inspection frequency, rail type, formation condition and traffic levels. The findings will benefit the heritage rail industry by minimising risk whilst accounting for resource limitations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to introduce the emerging non-contacting spray coating process and {{compare it to the}} existing coating techniques. Particular emphasis was given to the details of the spraying process of paper coating colour and the base paper requirements set by the new coating method. Spraying technology itself is nothing new, but the atomisation process of paper coating colour is quite unknown to the paper industry. The differences between the rheology of painting and coating colours make it very difficult to utilise the existing information from spray painting research. Based on the trials, some basic conclusion can be made:The {{results of this study suggest}} that the Brookfield viscosity of spray coating colour should be as low as possible, presently a 50 mPas level is regarded as an optimum. For the paper quality and coater runnability, the solids level should be as high as possible. However, the graininess of coated paper surface and the nozzle <b>wear</b> <b>limits</b> the maximum solids level to 60 % at the moment. Most likelydue to the low solids and low viscosity of the coating colour the low shear Brookfield viscosity correlates very well with the paper and spray fan qualities. High shear viscosity is also important, but yet less significant than the low shear viscosity. Droplet size should be minimized and besides keeping the brrokfield viscosity low that can be helped by using a surfactant or dispersing agent in the coating colour formula. Increasing the spraying pressure in the nozzle can also reduce the droplet size. The small droplet size also improves the coating coverage, since there is hardly any levelling taking place after the impact with the base paper. Because of the lack of shear forces after the application, the pigment particles do not orientate along the paper surface. Therefore the study indicates that based on the present know-how, no quality improvements can be obtained by the use of platy type of pigments. The other disadvantage of them is the rapid deterioration of the nozzle lifetime. Further research in both coating colour rheology and nozzle design may change this in the future, but so far only round shape pigments, like typically calcium carbonate is, can be used with spray coating. The low water retention characteristics of spray coating, enhanced by the low solids and low viscosity, challenge the base paper absorption properties. Filler level has to be low not to increase the number of small pores, which have a great influence on the absorption properties of the base paper. Hydrophobic sizing reduces this absorption and prevents binder migration efficiently. High surface roughness and especially poor formation of the base paper deteriorate thespray coated paper properties. However, pre-calendering of the base paper does not contribute anything to the finished paper quality, at least at the coating colour solids level below 60 %. When targeting a standard offset LWC grade, spraycoating produces similar quality to film coating, but yet blade coating being on a slightly better level. However, because of the savings in both investment and production costs, spray coating may have an excellent future ahead. The porousnature of the spray coated surface offers an optimum substrate for the coldset printing industry to utilise the potential of high quality papers in their business...|$|E
