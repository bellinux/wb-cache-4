5|$|Wagga has {{captured}} the interest of writers, novelists and songwriters over the years. Specifically the city's international notoriety surrounding Arthur Orton and the Tichborne Case attracted a visit from Mark Twain when he visited Australia in the 1890s.

5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{security}} guard {{the night of}} the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E

5|$|Obama, at age 38, was a {{lecturer}} at the University of Chicago and a two-term state Senator. Though friends, including Terry Link, his colleague in the Illinois Senate, warned Obama against challenging Rush, {{as there was}} no obvious reason to displace him to the voters, Obama ran anyway because of his frustration with what he claimed was Republican obstructionism in the Illinois Legislature and the feeling Rush was representing the district less well as he could. Also challenging Rush were Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a police officer. Raymond Wardingly, a perennial candidate <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> clown, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E

5|$|Springbok colours {{are only}} awarded to South Africans.

Following South Africa's victory in the Rugby World Cup, all players and coaching team members were expected to wear their Springbok colours to the post-tournament awards dinner. In protest at Jones not being issued with colours, Bryan Habana gave Jones his Springbok colours and the team attended the awards dinner in suits instead of in Springbok colours.|$|E

5|$|The in-game {{cinematic}} cutscenes for Halo Wars 2 {{were created}} by animation company Blur Studio. Blur had worked with developers to create animation for past Halo titles, including the original Halo Wars. The scenes were directed by Dave Wilson, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> visual effects supervisor on the Halo Wars cutscenes. 343 Industries explained that alterations to the appearance of returning characters were a result of upgraded technology, the use of performance capture, and casting new actors. Wilson explained that advances in technology allowed the animation team to capture body motion, facial motion, and audio simultaneously for Halo Wars 2, unlike during the development of Halo Wars, where each of these performances was recorded separately and later combined.|$|E

The relationship was frowned upon by Wise's family, and both Wise's mother, Sophie Hasel, and her aunt, Lily Gienke, made no secret of their desire for Wise to end the relationship. By the end of 1924, Wise had acquiesced, and the relationship ended. Johns moved to Cleveland and the couple lost contact.|$|E

5|$|A {{recommendation}} from Burstall helped Baxter secure a research engineer position with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Billingham, where a new chemical factory {{had been established}} to make sodium hydroxide. Here he met Lilian May Thatcher, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stenographer in nearby Stockton-on-Tees. The two became engaged, but before they could marry, Alexander Fleck had Baxter transferred to ICI's new General Chemicals Division in Widnes {{as head of the}} Central Laboratory. Baxter and Lilian were married in the register office in Stockton-on-Tees on 17 August 1931. Three years later they designed and built their own home in Farnworth, where they lived until 1949. They had four children: a daughter, Valerie; an adopted son, Peter; and sons Dennis and Roderick.|$|E
5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying {{the foundation for the}} headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{was born}} in Handsworth, a suburb of Sheffield, which was then part of West Riding of Yorkshire (the County of South Yorkshire was created in 1974). He {{is the son of}} Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He has a younger sister named Lorraine. His father owned a {{fabrication}} shop that employed 50 people, including Bean's mother, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which left a piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking and left a large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his dream of playing football professionally.|$|E
