The individual methods of assessment of these prices were introduced in the theoretical component. The possible obstacles connected to its usage were described and most important information needed for transfer pricing documentation were summarized. The practical component includes functional analysis of specific company. Furthermore, all the transactions from the year 2015 amongst related parties were identified and described in detail. In relation to the main production activity the method of net range was used for transfer price verification. The Albertina database was used for elaboration of comparative analysis. To verify the profit margin applied by the company for production, it was used the multi-criterion and gradual <b>weight</b> <b>schedule</b> with subsequent application of point method. This thesis revealed defects that have been presented to the representatives of the company's management. It was stated {{that it is necessary to}} perform the revision of profit margin because of profit misinterpretation and lower tax payment of corporate income tax. It was clearly demonstrated that the elaboration of transfer pricing documentation is not a useless administrative burden. On the contrary, it is an important base for mapping and analysing inter-company transactions. Correctly elaborated documentation can be used also a negotiation argument with related parties that are usually in a stronger negotiating position or in dealing with financial administration regarding tax inspection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A major {{challenge}} {{in the design and}} operation of wireless networks is to jointly route packets and schedule transmissions to efficiently share the common spectrum among links in the same area. Due to the lack of central control in wireless networks, these algorithms have to be decentralized. It was recently shown that distributed (greedy) algorithms can usually guarantee only fractional throughput. It was also recently shown that if a set of conditions regarding the network topology (known as Local Pooling) is satisfied, simple distributed maximal <b>weight</b> (greedy) <b>scheduling</b> algorithms achieve 100 % throughput. In this paper, we focus on networks in which packets have to undergo multihop routing and derive multihop Local Pooling conditions for that setting.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding the maximum directed packet flow that can be sustained in an infinite wireless multihop network. This ability of the network to relay traffic is called the forwarding capacity, and the problem appears when the spatial scales corresponding to the end-toend paths (routing) and the neighboring nodes (forwarding) are strongly separated in a massively dense network. We assume a Boolean interference model. The infinite network is approximated with a finite but large network where the node locations form a spatial Poisson process. We study two constructive approaches to tighten the lower bound for the forwarding capacity by a significant amount. In path scheduling the packets traverse the network using predefined paths that do not interfere with each other, and coordination is thus required only between the nodes of a path. In greedy maximum <b>weight</b> <b>scheduling,</b> the transmissions are scheduled greedily according to queue-length based weights of the links. In addition to a fixed transmission radius, we consider greedy maximum <b>weight</b> <b>scheduling</b> with a transmission radius adjustable up to a given maximum. We are able to produce numerical results that characterize the achievable forwarding capacity under global coordination of the transmissions, providing, e. g., concrete points of reference for practical distributed implementations.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the question of}} obtaining tight delay guarantees for throughout-optimal link scheduling in arbitrary topology wireless ad-hoc networks. Two classes of scheduling policies are considered: 1) a maximum queue-length weighted independent set scheduling policy, 2) a randomized independent set scheduling policy where the set scheduling probabilities are selected optimally. Both policies stabilize all queues for any set of feasible packet arrival rates, and are therefore throughputoptimal. For these policies, we show that the average packet delay is bounded by a constant {{that depends on the}} chromatic number of the interference graph, and the arrival slack in the system – a metric representing the overall load on the network. We prove that this upper bound is asymptotically tight in the sense that there exist classes of topologies where the expected delay attained by any scheduling policy is lower bounded by the same constant. We extend our upper bounds to the case of multi-hop sessions. Through simulations, we study how our analysis compares with actual delays computed for i. i. d., Markovian and trace-driven packet arrival processes.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} two issues in {{multihop}} wireless networks—poor end-to-end delay performance and high per-slot computational overhead {{of the classical}} max-weight algorithm. To reduce the end-to-end delay, we first propose a simple modification to the classical maximum <b>weight</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm that promotes the use of shorter paths by the packets. The significantly lower delays are shown via simulation. The modification that we suggest does not reduce the schedulable region and has the same complexity as the classical algorithm. Next, we propose a static routing and scheduling scheme that is obtained by adapting the classical optimal routing problem of wireline networks to multihop wireless networks. The static scheme slows the timescale of routing and scheduling computations from per-slot to the timescale {{of change in the}} network traffic pattern; thus the computation complexity is reduced. We also show, via simulations, that the delay performance in the static scheme is comparable to that of the dynamic scheme that we have proposed. I...|$|R

40|$|Under the {{assumption}} of outdated channel state information (CSI) at the source, we consider the finite blocklength (FBL) throughput of a two-hop relaying system. Previous work has considered this setting so far only for the infinite blocklength case, where decoding can be arbitrarily reliable as long as operating below the Shannon limit. In contrast, in the FBL regime residual decoding errors can not be avoided even when transmitting below the Shannon limit. This makes the scheduling problem at the source more vulnerable to transmission errors, where we investigate the trade-off between the choice of so called <b>scheduling</b> <b>weights</b> to avoid transmission errors and the resulting coding rate. We show that the corresponding maximization of the throughput under a reliability constraint can be solved efficiently by iterative algorithms. Nevertheless, the optimal solution requires a recomputation of the <b>scheduling</b> <b>weights</b> prior to each transmission. Thus, we also study heuristics relying on choosing the <b>scheduling</b> <b>weights</b> only once. Through numerical analysis, we first provide insights {{on the structure of}} the throughout under different <b>scheduling</b> <b>weights</b> and channel correlation coefficients. We then turn to the comparison of the optimal scheduling with the heuristic and show that the performance gap between them is only significant for relay systems with high average signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) on the backhaul and relaying link. In particular, the optimal scheduling scheme provides most value in case that the data transmission is subject to strict reliability constraints, justifying the significant additional computational burden.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). The heavy tailed traffic in {{wireless}} networks fundamentally challenges the applicability of conventional throughput optimal scheduling algorithms. To encounter this, the stability performance of distributed maximum <b>weight</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms (DMWS), which {{are known to be}} throughput optimal under light tailed environment, is first analyzed. More specifically, it is shown that heavy tailed traffic can significantly degrade the stability performance of DMWS. In particular, it is proven that if a user with light-tailed traffic arrivals has the average traffic rate lambda below a threshold lambda*, it will experience bounded queueing delay. Otherwise, if lambda is larger than a threshold. lambda', its queueing delay is necessarily of infinite mean. To address this problem, the distributed maximum weight-alpha scheduling (DMWS-alpha) algorithm is proposed, which makes the scheduling decision based on the queue lengths raised to the alpha-th power. It is demonstrated that DMWS-alpha is throughput optimal with respect to moment stability in the sense that if the traffic arrivals rates are within the network stability region, all network users with light-tailed traffic arrivals always have bounded queueing delay with finite mean and variance...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Tassiulas and Ephremides (1992) {{proposed}} the maximum <b>weight</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm of throughput-optimality for constrained queueing networks {{that arise in}} the context of communication networks, extensive efforts have been devoted to resolving its most important drawback: high complexity. This paper proposes a generic framework for designing throughput- optimal and low-complexity scheduling algorithms for constrained queueing networks. Under our framework, a scheduling algorithm updates current schedules by interacting with a given oracle system that generates an approximate solution to a related optimization task. One can utilize our framework to design a variety of scheduling algorithms by choosing an oracle system such as random search, Markov chain, belief propagation, and primal-dual methods. The complexity of the resulting scheduling algorithm is determined by the number of operations required for an oracle to process a single query, which is typically small. We provide sufficient conditions for throughput-optimality of the scheduling algorithm in general constrained queueing network models. The linear-time algorithm of Tassiulas (1998) and the random access algorithm of Shah and Shin (2012) correspond to special cases of our framework using random search and Markov chain oracles, respectively.

The scheduler stores a sparse set of basic schedules, and chooses the max-weight basic schedule for transmission in each time slot. At the same time, the scheduler tries to update the set of basic schedules by searching for a new basic schedule in a throughput increasing direction. We show that both of the above procedures can be achieved in a distributed manner. Specifically, we propose an average consensus based link contending algorithm to implement the distributed max <b>weight</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Further, we show that the basic schedule update can be implemented using CSMA mechanisms, {{which is similar to}} the one proposed by Jiang et al.

In particular, with only persistent flows, it does not matter for throughput optimality whether one uses queue lengths or HoL ages as weights. In this paper, we show the following interesting result: when some flows in the network are dynamic (i. e., they arrive and depart from the network and are not persistent), then HoL-age-based scheduling algorithms are throughput-optimal while it has previously been shown that queue-length-based algorithms are not. This reveals that, age-based algorithms are universal in the sense that their throughput optimality does not depend on whether the arriving traffic is persistent or not. We also present a distributed implementation of the proposed age-based algorithm using CSMA techniques, where each flow only knows its own age and carrier sensing information. Finally, we support our analytical results through simulations. The proof of throughput optimality may be interesting in its own right: it uses a novel Lyapunov function which is the sum of the ages of all the packets in the network. I...|$|R
