60|$|A {{relief to}} him to see her! Why? How? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> strange word mean, {{addressed}} to her? She roused herself, and {{put the question to}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "That so?" [...] {{said the}} young man. [...] "Why, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> fellow mean, {{over at the}} drug store, just now, by his getting out for Canada?" ...|$|E
60|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. Talk in your sleep, sir? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? You are not married.|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. Infatuated? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> mean? Made foolish, is it not? Oh no: I wish I were.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for the winter 2015 issue of the official Disney fan club publication Disney twenty-three, Trowbridge stated: [...] "Our intent {{is to make it}} feel as if you just walked into one of the movies... Bringing Star Wars to life in the physical world gives us the opportunity to play with a whole bunch of things we've never done before... to really engage all of the senses. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> street feel like? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> animal smell like? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> blue milk taste like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> paper contain, citizen Marat?" [...] asked Bibot, also {{speaking}} in a whisper, for an access of superstitious terror was gripping him by the throat.|$|E
60|$|So {{he wished}} to {{introduce}} her to his sisters! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> mean? If the Deyncourts were ever so high they could not sneer at Lord Northmoor's sisters.|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> new {{allusion to}} Mr. Engelman mean? And {{why had she}} {{declined}} to despatch her letter to him, when the opportunity offered of sending it by the boy? ...|$|E
5000|$|... 'Oh,' said Eeny again. 'So then if I {{call you}} a big blowhard, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> make you?'" [...] (pp. 10-11) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, señor, I don't want to 'butt in,' but <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> monkey-faced, cat-eyed, rubber-necked tin horn tough {{want with}} you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} eldest brother; [...] "but <b>what</b> exactly <b>does</b> <b>that</b> mean? Just <b>what</b> <b>does</b> it mean--when <b>that</b> day of trouble comes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! it is {{not what}} it was,' said the Earl. 'I suppose I must call there before the holidays, though,' he added, reluctantly. 'But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> man, Ramsbotham, want with you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then tell me {{what was}} in it. You must. This matter must be cleared up--I {{am not going to}} have our {{beautiful}} friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> letter say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{deal with}} children! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> mean?" [...] thought the Countess, {{as she stepped}} along {{by the side of}} her uncle, not venturing to speak, and feeling almost as shy and bewildered as when she was on the world alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was armed, and he couldn't. But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> {{matter is}} this;--that they who {{were with him}} were {{thoroughly}} bad fellows. Was he at home last night?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Harper {{turned and}} glared at him, but Appleby still {{clutched}} his shoulder resolutely, and his face relaxed. “Well,” he said more calmly, “I guess I’ve hurt more than the feelings of one of them. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> fellow shove us out for, anyway?” ...|$|E
60|$|Mor. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> greatness in a woman's mind? Ill lodged, {{and weak}} to act what it designed? Pleasure's your portion, and your slothful ease: When man's at leisure, study how to please, Soften his angry hours with servile care, And, when he calls, the ready feast prepare.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Dick," [...] {{answered}} Hugh sadly, [...] "doubtless we {{can make}} a fight for it and take some with us to a quieter world, if they are foolish enough to give us a chance.

40|$|Some one {{tells you}} they love you. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> mean? How <b>do</b> you know? • You think someone is intelligent. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> mean? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> {{you use to}} make that inference? • Absence makes the heart grow fonder but propinquity leads to attraction.

60|$|Lenore awakened early. The morning seemed golden. Birds {{were singing}} at her window. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> day hold {{in store for}} her? She pressed a hand hard on her heart as if to hold it still. But her heart went right on, swift, exultant, {{throbbing}} with a fullness that was almost pain.|$|E
6000|$|Whereat the Admiral {{could not}} help {{laughing}} heartily, and then he picked himself out as the general, laughed again, and said: 'Naughty girl! Bess, I'm glad that is not your line. Little tracts--Goody Two-Shoes! Why, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> paper say of your essay, Miss Bess? That it might stand a comparison with Helps, wasn't it?' ...|$|E
60|$|He came to {{a sudden}} resolution. He would {{postpone}} the parting. He would ask them to dinner. Over the best that the Savoy Hotel could provide they would fight the afternoon's battle over again. He did not {{know who they were}} or anything about them, but <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter? They were brother-fans. That was enough for him.|$|E

6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> grunt mean, I {{should like}} to know? I believe you've begun to suspect the poor man already, without seeing him." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{no doubt}} about that. Blackie's right eye was blinder than any bat's; it was an opaque white ball--a {{circumstance}} which caused it no little annoyance, for the other eye had to do duty for both, and this involved constant screwing of the head about, and unwearied watchfulness. It {{was as if a}} solitary sentinel were placed to guard the front and back doors of a house at one and the same time. Despite Blackie's utmost care, Jacky got on her blind side more than once, and caught her by the remnant of her poor tail. This used to spoil Tilly's morning amusement, and send her sorrowful into the house. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter to Jacky? He sometimes broke out worse than usual, and set the whole brood into an agitated flutter, which rather damaged the happiness of the family. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter to Jacky? ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mohun {{was not at}} all uneasy as to {{the young}} lord. An Eton boy's admiration of a pretty face did not amount to much, even if Ivinghoe had not {{understood}} 'Noblesse oblige' too well to leave a young girl unsheltered. Besides, he and all the rest were going away the next day. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> final hint mean? ...|$|E
60|$|He stopped suddenly, and {{his hands}} fell to his side. Slowly he turned round and looked at her, half doubtfully, half fearfully. What had he said? What had she heard? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> look in her face mean--that look of anguish, of fear, of horror? Why did she not speak, even though it were to accuse him? Anything rather than that awful silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? I {{should have}} you to nurse me. It wouldn't be necessary. And besides, I'm different; I'm not of any importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, don't be silly. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? Help me into my cloth coat--not the fur--it's too heavy--and then go and {{get that}} money changed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{him look}} out," [...] said Father Brown. [...] "The sun was the cruellest {{of all the}} gods. But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> monstrous eye mean?" ...|$|R
