5|$|The Member {{became a}} close {{associate}} and political {{friend of the}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. After Pitt's death in 1806, Ferguson did not so easily retain his seat in Parliament. In the elections of 1806, he retained the seat by just two votes, and his opponent General Alexander Hay demanded he be investigated for bribery and corruption. Ferguson again beat Hay in the contest for the seat in June 1807, but {{this time with a}} more convincing majority of 54 to 39 votes. Ferguson was unopposed in the next three elections. Some records indicate that Ferguson never spoke in the Commons except to complain about a broken <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> his seat causing a draught. He is actually recorded as speaking on at least five occasions over the years.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass fanlight depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E
25|$|La Femme aux Phlox is an oil {{on canvas}} with {{dimensions}} 81 x 100cm (31 by 39 inches) signed and dated 'Alb Gleizes 10'. Created {{during the second half}} of 1910, the painting represents a woman sitting in an interior setting, with a vase of flowers (phloxes) in front and another to her left. The <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> the sitter opens out onto an exterior scene, the whole blurring the distinction between interior and exterior.|$|E

25|$|The fort's first Catholic {{church was}} built in 1871 and was later {{replaced}} by St. Ignatius Chapel in 1889. St. Ignatius Chapel was destroyed by fire in December 2001. The first Protestant chapel, Memorial Chapel, was built by prison labor in 1878 of stone quarried on post. The round <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> the chapel's front altar was intentionally installed slightly askew by an inmate who was angry at his work boss. This chapel has brass cannon embedded in the walls {{at the sides of}} the church, and photos of many of the officers involved in the early history of the fort, including some of the Custer family.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1950s that the {{courthouse}} undertook major renovations. In 1955, the distillate stoves were replaced with butane heaters allowing the chimneys to be reduced to roof level while the roof was also replaced. In 1956, the roof would be replaced again for the fifth or sixth time since the building's completion in 1911. New flooring was installed in the courtroom and some offices, and the courtroom ceiling was lowered for acoustics and heating. In the courtroom, theater-style seating was installed while the upper gallery was removed. A new plywood bench for the judge and a jury box with matching railing were built. The stained glass <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> the judge's bench was boarded and plastered. Downstairs, exterior steel doors were installed, and a counter shelf was built for the office of the sheriff and tax-assessor collector along with five fire extinguishers provided for the premises. In 1957, two gas heaters with electric blowers were installed in the space formerly occupied by the courtroom's upper gallery to heat the courtroom. The building's roof would require replacement in 1974 and again 1975.|$|E
500|$|Brooks's {{portrait}} of Barney has a softer look than her other {{paintings of the}} 1920s. Barney sits, swathed in a fur coat, in the house at 20 Rue Jacob where she lived and held her salon. In the <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> her, the courtyard is seen dusted with snow. Brooks often included animals or models of animals in her compositions to represent the personalities of her sitters; she painted Barney with a small sculpture of a horse, alluding to the love of riding that had led Remy de Gourmont to nickname her [...] "the Amazon". The paper on which the horse stands {{may be one of}} Barney's manuscripts.|$|E

She goes upstairs and gets a tranquilliser gun, but when Detweiler, {{in the guise of}} a dhole, enters Berquist's bedroom to attack her, she sets the gun aside and challenges the dhole. He attacks, causing both of them to fall out of the <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> her. Mulder and Scully arrive and find Detweiler's and Berquist's bodies, the former impaled on a fence spike. Back at the office, Mulder receives a package from Berquist; it is her [...] "I Want to Believe" [...] poster, a replacement for the one he lost in a fire and last seen hanging on her home office wall.|$|E

Caroline then learns that Mac wants to meet her at the train station, but when she arrives, it is Guy who turns up. Mac is still at the hospital, where he learns {{that he is going to}} die. Caroline then accepts Guy's proposal of marriage. Meanwhile, in the HR department, Karen is sitting on a windowsill, due to her fear of Clangers. Whilst sitting there, Rachel opens the <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> her, and causes Karen to fall out. However, no one seems to notice.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Mars {{displaying}} sadness as he reminisces about the moments spent {{between him and}} his [...] "brunette vixen" [...] girlfriend in an [...] "sparsely" [...] decorated apartment. Throughout the video, the singer expresses his emptiness and devastation recurring to solo shots in which he stands [...] "around looking sullen" [...] and by using [...] "faded lighting" [...] in order to convey such sentiments. Flashes {{of the two of them}} giggling, kissing, snuggling, pouring out romance and being [...] "playful" [...] are shown, as the singer apparently misses their relationship. After the opening sequence, Mars holds a private screening of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] to please her, the couple kiss in front of a cinema projector lights, while romantic scenes from the , including the honeymoon and the one where Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, sweeps Bella, portrayed by Kristen Stewart, [...] "off her feet and into their new home", are projected on the wall. As the video continues, the couple begins to fight, leading to more [...] "heated arguments and lonely nights". At this point, Mars, possibly, writes a song to purse her to stay with him. A critic believed the song written only helped Mars to lead with the break up by telling the story. Nevertheless, MTV's, Jocelyn Vena stated [...] "we see that the song Bruno wrote while his lady was asleep turned out to be romantic enough to win her back." [...] The video ends with Mats revisiting scenes of the relationship and being set back to the present. In the final shot the singer is alone as rain pours down and hits the <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> him.|$|E

2500|$|Models popularly {{termed the}} PA-3/PB-3 {{were in fact}} only an upgrade of the PA-2/PB-2. The true PA-3/PB-3 model would have boasted , though none were ever built. Aside from the small power {{increase}} between the PA-1 and the PA-2, differences were minor. Externally PA-2s could be distinguished {{by the absence of}} the [...] "eyebrow" [...] trim piece on the grille behind the cab and the porthole <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> the radiator shutters. Internally, later PA-2 and PB-2 production featured a water-cooled turbocharger and other engine compartment changes, but these were frequently added to older models undergoing major repairs or overhauls. Four PA-1s were upgraded by Morrison-Knudsen in 1974-75 for passenger service on the Delaware & Hudson and became the PA4. These were eventually used by Amtrak for the [...] "Adirondack" [...] train and then by the Mass Bay Transit Authority before being sold to Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Tirley Garth {{is built}} in pebble-dashed brick with buff {{sandstone}} dressings, a York stone-slate roof and tall pebble-dashed chimneys. It is {{designed in the}} Art and Crafts style. [...] The word “garth” in its name derives from the house being built around an internal courtyard. On {{all sides of the}} courtyard are stone cloisters with three arches on each side and in its centre is a sunken circular pool reached by curved steps. The living quarters are on the south, west and east sides. [...] The south front, with views towards the Beeston and Peckforton Hills, is the main front. [...] It is symmetrical with five bays, all of which are gabled. [...] The central bay has a large semicircular projection in two storeys with an eleven-light mullioned and transomed <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> which is the great hall. Above this is a five-light window. The end bays have canted two-storey projections with four-light windows above them. [...] The west front is the entrance front. [...] It has eight bays, is mainly in two storeys, and has a three-storey tower to the right. [...] Internally there are many architectural details with some fine wood-carving, and tiles which are unique to the house.|$|E
50|$|The nave is {{flanked by}} two aisles with {{galleries}} borne by eleven pillars on each side. The arches above the galleries are supported by five pillars. The <b>windows</b> <b>behind</b> the galleries are decorated with glass paintings designed by C. N. Overgaard.|$|R

2500|$|L14A/B - Two of {{the flat}} fronted 1935 stock {{prototype}} cars were rebuilt to create this locomotive. The donor cars, numbers 10011 and 11011, had been displaced from the Epping - Ongar shuttle in 1966. They were transferred to Acton Works for articulation experiments, thought being given {{at the time to}} the articulation of trains on the Northern line. The trailing ends of the two motor cars were cut back so there was only one <b>window</b> <b>behind</b> the rear double doors, and both were mounted on a single steel bogie. The outer bogies were replaced with new lightweight ones, constructed of aluminium, and the unit was ready for testing to begin in August 1970. After a year of trials, engineers had collected sufficient data, and as it was never intended for the vehicle to enter passenger service, it was transferred to Acton Works as a shunting locomotive, where it was particularly useful, as the shoes spanned [...] The experimental lightweight aluminium motor bogies were removed in 1975, and fitted to 1972 MkII car No3363, so that long-term testing of the design could be carried out. This ended the life of LT's only articulated locomotive, which was scrapped at Acton later that year.|$|E
