5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered <b>woofer</b> that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a <b>woofer</b> to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
5|$|Its two {{drivers are}} a 180mm paper <b>woofer</b> and a 35mm soft-domed tweeter. The woofer's diaphragm, {{weighing}} 3.7g, is manufactured from a flat sheet of pressed pulp paper. Unconventionally, it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure, but by curling and then gluing the two ends together. Against the black finish of the cabinet, the white bass/mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic {{feature of the}} product.|$|E

5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through a {{rotating}} speaker cabinet known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its inventor Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating horn over a stationary treble compression driver, and a rotating baffle beneath a stationary bass <b>woofer.</b> This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources.|$|E
5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single <b>woofer</b> for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the <b>woofer</b> and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
50|$|Thiele Small Parameters {{refer to}} a set of {{electromechanical}} parameters developed in the 1960’s and 70’s that define the specified low frequency performance of a loudspeaker driver. They are still used by speaker designers today to model the behavior of drivers and enclosures. At the time, 8” <b>woofers</b> were considered the smallest size that could produce acceptable bass and 15” <b>woofers</b> were commonplace in home speakers.|$|R

5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a <b>woofer</b> system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the speaker}} uses bought-in drivers, {{they have been}} rebuilt using {{stronger}} materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to control energy. The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile {{and replaced it with}} the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run; the Scan-Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The <b>woofer</b> is a KEF B139.|$|E
5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the <b>woofer.</b> Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
5000|$|Cone tweeters have a {{narrower}} dispersion characteristic {{that is the}} same as a cone <b>woofer's.</b> Many designers therefore believed this made them a good match to cone midranges and <b>woofers,</b> allowing for superb stereo imaging. However, the [...] "sweet spot" [...] created by the narrow dispersion of cone tweeters is small. Speakers with cone tweeters offered the best stereo imaging when positioned in the room's corners, a common practice in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s.|$|R

Rockford Fosgate amplifiers, Image Dynamics speakers, JL Audio <b>woofers,</b> and Alpine head units were also featured. Josh Abrahams is shown performing on the decks on the screen of the Alpine headunit.|$|R
25|$|<b>Woofer</b> {{enclosures}} must {{be larger}} and more sturdily built than cabinets for mid-range or high-frequency (tweeter) speakers. As such, in the 1950s, when Ampeg introduced bass amplifier and speaker systems, bass guitarists began to use them. Similarly, Hammond organ players used a specialized keyboard combo amplifier, the Leslie speaker cabinet, which contains a <b>woofer</b> for the low frequencies and a horn for the high frequencies. The Leslie horns rotate and a baffle around the <b>woofer</b> rotates as well, producing a rich tremolo and chorus effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{acoustic}} suspension <b>woofer</b> {{is a type}} of loudspeaker {{that reduces}} bass distortion caused by non-linear, stiff mechanical suspensions in conventional loudspeakers. The acoustic suspension loudspeaker was invented in 1954 by Edgar Villchur, and brought to commercial production by Villchur and Henry Kloss with the founding of Acoustic Research in Cambridge Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|In {{the world}} of speakers, Thiele Small Parameters refer {{to a set of}} {{electromechanical}} parameters that define the specified low frequency performance of a loudspeaker driver. They were developed over the course of decades and culminated in the 1960’s and 1970’s, at a time where 8” <b>woofers</b> were considered the smallest size that could produce acceptable bass and 15” <b>woofers</b> were commonplace in home speakers. Bruzzese’s belief was that scientific theories and formulas pertaining to loudspeaker development from two decades earlier were outdated and ripe to be rewritten.|$|R

25|$|Human created sources: {{infrasound}} can {{be generated}} by human processes such as sonic booms and explosions (both chemical and nuclear), or by machinery such as diesel engines, wind turbines and specially designed mechanical transducers (industrial vibration tables). Certain specialized loudspeaker designs are also able to reproduce extremely low frequencies; these include large-scale rotary <b>woofer</b> models of subwoofer loudspeaker, as well as large horn loaded, bass reflex, sealed and transmission line loudspeakers.|$|E
25|$|Infrasound is {{characterized}} by an ability to cover long distances and get around obstacles with little dissipation. In music, acoustic waveguide methods, such as a large pipe organ or, for reproduction, exotic loudspeaker designs such as transmission line, rotary <b>woofer,</b> or traditional subwoofer designs can produce low-frequency sounds, including near-infrasound. Subwoofers designed to produce infrasound are capable of sound reproduction an octave or more below that of most commercially available subwoofers, and are often about 10 times the size.|$|E
25|$|Their {{follow-up}} album, A <b>Woofer</b> in Tweeter's Clothing, {{led to a}} tour of the United Kingdom, {{including a}} residency at the Marquee Club in London, which incidentally saw on one night Queen open for Sparks. These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following. An appearance on the BBC Television's The Old Grey Whistle Test led to wider interest where host Bob Harris compared the band to a cross between Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention and the Monkees.|$|E

50|$|As an analogy, {{the hub of}} {{the rotary}} <b>woofer's</b> fan is {{somewhat}} like a helicopter's swashplate which allows a stationary source of reciprocating motion—the voice coil of the subwoofer—to change the angle of the spinning set of blades.|$|R

25|$|High-pass filters {{have many}} applications. They {{are used as}} part of an audio {{crossover}} to direct high frequencies to a tweeter while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a low-pass filter for the <b>woofer</b> and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor and nothing else).|$|E
25|$|A {{mid-range}} {{speaker is}} a loudspeaker driver that reproduces {{a band of}} frequencies generally between 1–6kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the <b>woofer</b> and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the {{throat of a horn}} for added output level and control of radiation pattern.|$|E

The Robonic Stooges later aired as a separate half-hour series, retitled The Three Robonic Stooges (each half-hour featured two segments of The Three Robonic Stooges and one segment of <b>Woofer</b> & Whimper, Dog Detectives, the latter re-edited from episodes of Clue Club, an earlier Hanna-Barbera cartoon series).|$|E
