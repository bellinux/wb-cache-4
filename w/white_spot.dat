5|$|The {{business}} expanded, and by 1910 Dunhill {{had taken}} additional premises in Duke Street. In 1912 {{he was joined}} in the business by his youngest brother, Herbert, and his eldest son, Alfred, followed by his second son, Vernon, in 1913. In 1912 Dunhill introduced the <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> trademark to its pipes.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow {{ring around the}} eyes, which is more prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's usually bland {{atmosphere}} occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals {{and other}} features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm {{was an example of}} a Great <b>White</b> <b>Spot,</b> a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, {{around the time of the}} northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.|$|E
40|$|Distended lacteals, {{described}} as expanded white villi in duodenum, are strongly indicative of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia. In the present study, we evaluated {{the significance of}} <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> present in the duodenal mucosa of dogs with lymphocytic plasmacytic enteritis (LPE). Fifty dogs with LPE were included in this study, and <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> were detected in the duodenal mucosa in 22 dogs during endoscopy. Hypoproteinemia was more frequent in dogs with <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> than in dogs without spots (p = 0. 02). Serum protein and albumin concentration were significantly lower in LPE dogs with <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> (p = 0. 038) compared to LPE dogs without <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> (p = 0. 039). There was a significant correlation between <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> density and lymphatic dilatation histological scores (p = 0. 023; ρ = 0. 481). These {{results suggest that the}} presence of <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> in the duodenal mucosa of dogs is not a finding exclusive for intestinal lymphangiectasia. Low serum protein and albumin concentrations together with lymphatic dilatation seem {{to be related to the}} presence of <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> in the duodenal mucosa of LPE dogs...|$|R

5|$|The flame robin is territorial, {{defending}} {{its territory}} against {{other members of}} its species and also scarlet robins where they co-occur. In Nimmitabel in southern New South Wales, migratory flame robins invaded and eked out their territories from amid existing scarlet robin territories. Once settled, however, no species dominated over the other and stable boundaries emerged. The flame robin deploys a number of agonistic displays, including a breast-puffing display where it puffs its breast feathers and a <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> display where it puffs its feathers to accentuate its frontal white crown, white wing markings or white outer tail feathers. They may also fly at intruders or sing to defend their territory.|$|E
5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|The modern Labrador's {{ancestors}} originated on {{the island}} of Newfoundland, now part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's water dog, a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with mastiffs brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin, and muzzle - known as tuxedo markings - characteristic of the St. John's Dog often appear in modern Lab mixes, and will occasionally manifest in Labradors as a small <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.|$|E

40|$|Many curious <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> of 1 – 10 cm {{diameter}} {{were found}} on wet snow (~ 10 mm thick) {{on the morning of}} 1 November 2009 in Kitami and Oketo in Hokkaido, Japan. At first glance, the <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> appeared to be made of spherically gathered snow; however, they had actually been formed by the scattering of sunlight over wet snow. Thin air bubbles enclosed in the wet snow caused a diffuse reflection of sunlight and formed the <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b> We refer to this phenomenon as <b>white</b> <b>spotted</b> wet snow. Although this type of snow has been briefly described previously, the formation process, meteorological conditions that lead to its formation, its vertical structure and the horizontal distribution of the <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> are unknown. Our study addresses these issues. In addition, three independent methods (a nearest-neighbour method, Voronoi diagram and two-dimensional correlation function) demonstrate that the <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> are not randomly distributed but tend to be surrounded by six other spots...|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} the <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> pattern in Dutch boxer dogs is not known. We studied whether the {{segregation}} of <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> in boxers follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Blood samples were collected, along with digital photographs in standard directions of (grand) parents (n 16) and offspring (n 52) from eight litters of Dutch boxers. In order to select heterozygous parents, we selected nonuniform litters, in which at least one puppy was extreme white. On the basis of criteria for the location, the extent of <b>white</b> <b>spotting,</b> and the mean percentage of pigmented area of the foot soles, we classified 10 dogs as solid colored, 27 as flashy, and 15 as extreme white. This {{was not a significant}} deviation from the expected 1 : 2 : 1 ratio. Because the flashy phenotype seems to be an intermediate between the two homozygotes, <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> in the Dutch boxer can be considered to be due to a single gene effect, with incomplete dominance. We have evaluated candidate genes c-KIT (KIT) and EDNRB for segregation with <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> phenotype in these litters. Using polymorphic markers, very near the KIT and EDNRB genes, we found that segregation of the <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> pattern did not coincide with segregation of these polymorphic markers. Thus neither KIT nor EDNRB are likely to be responsible for <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> in the Dutch population of boxers. In domestic animals the major locus of <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> is known as the spotting locus (S). This locus comprises, i...|$|R

25|$|The {{black-necked stilt}} is {{distinguished}} from non-breeding vagrants of the Old World black-winged stilt by the <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> above the eye. Vagrants {{of the northern}} American form in turn {{is hard to tell}} apart from the resident Hawaiian stilt, in which only the eye-spot is markedly smaller. But though many stilt populations are long-distance migrants and during their movements can be found hundreds of miles offshore, actual trans-oceanic vagrants are nonetheless a rare occurrence.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{confusion}} with relatives it is poorly known, but it likely reaches at least 2 m in length. Its upperparts are greyish or brownish with 4-5 rows of <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> along each side; above each pectoral fin {{there is a}} dark spot surrounded by several smaller <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b> Except for its denser <b>white</b> <b>spotting,</b> it closely resembles the eyebrow wedgefish (R. palpebratus), but their ranges do not overlap.|$|R
50|$|Tirumala formosa has a {{wingspan}} reaching about 75 - 85 mm. The uppersides of the forewings {{are black}} with several <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> and a reddish-brown basal area. The uppersides of the hindwings are black, {{with a series}} of small <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> and a large hyaline basal area. The body is black with <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b> The undersides of the wings are similar to the uppersides, but the colours are paler.|$|R

25|$|The tips of {{the ears}} are rounded, with black hair along the edge. There are no tufts of longer hair {{on the top of}} the ears. Adult Iriomote cats have a <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> on the back of each ear, much like those found on tigers' ears. Young Iriomote cats do not have these marks, and even as adults the spots will not be as white as those seen on other leopard cat subspecies.|$|E
25|$|The Saturnian {{atmosphere}} is {{in several ways}} {{similar to that of}} Jupiter. It exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, and occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals caused by storms. A storm formation analogous to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the Great <b>White</b> <b>Spot,</b> is a short-lived phenomenon that forms with a roughly 30-year periodicity. It was last observed in 1990. However, the storms and the band pattern are less visible and active than those of Jupiter, due to the overlying ammonia hazes in Saturn's troposphere.|$|E
25|$|Its plumage is {{brilliant}} iridescent green, {{with a blue}} head, upper chest, tail and vent. The tiny <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> behind the eye, common among hummingbirds, is often not visible in this species, but the white ankle tufts, also common among the Trochilinae, are well-developed. The remiges are blackish-brown. It has a slightly decurved medium-long black bill. The sexes are very similar, but females are about one-fourth smaller and slightly duller than males on average. Immature birds appear like females, but their heads are particularly dull and brownish-tinged.|$|E
40|$|The <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> locus (S) in dogs is {{colocalized}} {{with the}} MITF (microphtalmia-associated transcription factor) gene. The phenotypic {{effects of the}} four S alleles range from solid colour (S) to extreme <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> (sw). We have investigated four candidate mutations associated with the sw allele, a SINE insertion, a SNP at a conserved site and a simple repeat polymorphism all associated with the MITF-M promoter {{as well as a}} 12 base pair deletion in exon 1 B. The variants associated with <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> at all four loci were also found among wolves and we conclude that none of these could be a sole causal mutation, at least not for extreme <b>white</b> <b>spotting.</b> We propose that the three canine <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> alleles are not caused by three independent mutations but represent haplotype effects due to different combinations of causa...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 18-23 mm. Adults are variable, {{but usually}} have two black and two <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> on the wing. The <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> are often ringed by black scales. They are on wing from August to April.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 15-16 mm. Adults have five <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> on black forewings and two <b>white</b> <b>spots</b> on the hindwings. There are yellow rings {{at the base of}} the abdomen and on the sixth segment.|$|R
25|$|The {{two common}} species of white-tailed spiders are Lampona cylindrata and Lampona murina. They {{are similar in}} appearance; L. cylindrata is {{slightly}} larger with females being up to 18mm long while males are up to 12mm in body length. The legs span approximately 28nbsp&mm. The two species are not easily distinguished without microscopic examination. They are slender spiders with dark reddish to grey, cigar-shaped body and dark orange-brown banded legs. The grey abdomen has two pairs of faint white spots and—usually but not always—a distinct <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> at the tip just above the spinnerets.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} damselflies, the young—known as naiads, nymphs, or larvae—are carnivorous. The most {{ubiquitous}} prey {{in the tree}} holes they inhabit are mosquito larvae, but they will also feed on tadpoles, syrphid fly and chironomid fly larvae, and other odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) naiads. The three leaflike caudal lamellae {{at the end of}} the abdomen, which serve as gills, are broad and elaborately folded, an adaptation to intermittent low oxygen availability in its habitat. Each lamella has a conspicuous <b>white</b> <b>spot,</b> making Megaloprepus easy to distinguish from other tree-hole damselflies.|$|E
