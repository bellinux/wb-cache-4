5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common. The Makeke School, founded by Coombs in the 1920s, became {{the foundation for the}} later established Liahona College. The church leased 276 acres near Nuku'alofa. The Liahona School opened in 1952 and led to a great expansion of the church. The Liahona School was intended to allow for more students with more hired faculty members and a broader curriculum. The education provided to Tongan students prepared them for life outside of Tonga, whether it <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> a secondary education or a job in America. Today, the school is known as Liahona High School.|$|E

They also allowed him to say to Hitler that he <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar assumed {{office as}} the Temenggong of Johor {{within three days}} of his father's demise. At {{the time of his}} succession, Johor was facing a {{political}} threat from the deposed Sultan, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah. The Sultan <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> his sovereignty claims over Johor and Pahang and aimed to overthrow the Sultan of Terengganu with the backing of Siam. Mahmud Muzaffar Shah established an alliance with Tun Ahmad, half-brother and rival of the Bendahara Tun Koris. The alliance caused Abu Bakar concern that the fall of Tun Koris in Pahang would threaten his own political position in Johor. Abu Bakar signed a treaty of friendship with Tun Koris in June 1862, and sent a small expeditionary force to Pahang to support Tun Koris when war broke out in August 1862.|$|E
5|$|Days before Halloween, a man explodes a {{truck in}} Mars' capital city, {{spreading}} what {{is assumed to}} be a new pathogen that kills or sickens over three hundred people.

Faye, who <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> Lee Sampson, a hacker that was apparently driving the truck, sees the terrorist and the Bebop crew decide to take on the bounty. Each follows different lines of inquiry. Ed, using a tattoo on the attacker's wrist, manages to identify him as Vincent Volaju, a former member of a military squad apparently killed in the Titan War. In reality, Vincent was the only survivor of a test involving the pathogen, having been immunized with a test vaccine: made an amnesic, he suffers from hallucinations, and his inability to tell dreams from reality eventually drove him insane.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{bombardment}} of Kagoshima, the Satsuma domain had become {{closer to the}} British and <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> the modernization of its army and navy with their support. The Scottish dealer Thomas Blake Glover sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains. American and British military experts, usually former officers, may have been directly involved in this military effort. The British ambassador Harry Smith Parkes supported the anti-Shogunate forces in a drive to establish a legitimate, unified Imperial rule in Japan, and to counter French influence with the Shogunate. During that period, southern Japanese leaders such as Saigō Takamori of Satsuma, or Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats, notably Ernest Mason Satow.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, MacLaren led Lancashire {{to victory}} in the County Championship, their only such success under his captaincy.

In all first-class cricket, MacLaren scored 1,191 runs at 31.34. At some point during the season, he was asked by Ranjitsinhji, a close friend, to become his private secretary, and both men travelled to India during the winter of 1904–05.

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management <b>was</b> <b>pursuing,</b> despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{the heir}} to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo; the {{assassination}} sparked the July Crisis and ultimately the First World War, which broke out a month later on 28 July. The German battlecruiser , which had been assigned to the Mediterranean Division, sought the protection of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and so Admiral Anton Haus sent the fleet, including Kaiser Karl VI, south on 7 August to assist his German ally. Goebens commander, Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, intended to use the Austro-Hungarian move as a feint to distract the British Mediterranean Fleet which <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> Goeben; Souchon instead took his ship to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire.

Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton <b>was</b> <b>pursuing</b> him.|$|E
