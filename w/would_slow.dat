5|$|In March 1998, {{after the}} closure of Europe's last tin mine at South Crofty in Cornwall (which later reopened for a period, and {{subsequently}} closed), the Cornish Solidarity Action Group (CSAG) encouraged commuters to pay the then-£1 toll in pennies. The group thought this <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> down collection of tolls and cause widespread congestion across the local area. The CSAG believed Cornwall should receive similar subsidies to South Wales and Merseyside, which were receiving regeneration grants from the government.|$|E
5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2010, {{the state}} of Washington filed suit to prevent the closing of Yucca Mountain, since this <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> efforts to clean up Hanford Nuclear Reservation. South Carolina, Aiken County (the {{location}} of Savannah River site) and others joined Washington. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit in July 2011, saying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not ruled on {{the withdrawal of the}} license application. Washington and South Carolina filed another lawsuit on July 29.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the quick}} {{engagement}} times, {{on the order}} of seconds, the Army decided that FAAD had to have semi-automatic actions. In combat, the operators would select targets on a long-range search radar and then simply say [...] "go" [...] to attack them. The system's fire control computer <b>would</b> <b>slew</b> the weapons and fire automatically as soon as they came in range.|$|R

5|$|Parachute: The {{earliest}} {{primitive form}} of the parachute was made some 4,000 {{years ago when the}} Chinese noticed that air resistance <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> a person's fall from a height. The Western Han Dynasty writer Sima Qian in his book Historical Records records the story of Shun, a legendary Chinese emperor who ran away from his murderous father by climbing onto the top of a high granary. As there was nowhere to go, Shun grabbed two bamboo hats and leapt off the granary and glided downward to safety.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E

5|$|On August 4, the FEAF began B-29 interdiction {{attacks against}} all key bridges {{north of the}} 37th Parallel in Korea, and on August 15 some light bombers and fighter-bombers joined in the interdiction {{campaign}}. This campaign sought the destruction of 32 rail and highway bridges on the three main transportation routes across Korea: the line from Sinanju south to P'yongyang and northeast to Wonsan on the east coast; the line just below the 38th Parallel from Munsan-ni through Seoul to Ch'unch'on to Chumunjin-up on the east coast; and the line from Seoul south to Choch'iwon and east to Wonju to Samch'ok on the east coast. The interdiction campaign marked nine rail yards, including those at Seoul, P'yongyang, and Wonsan, for attack, and the ports of Inch'on and Wonsan to be mined. This interdiction program, if effectively executed, <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> and perhaps critically disrupt the movement of North Korean supplies along the main routes south to the battlefront.|$|E
5|$|The VI Corps, {{together}} with units from the French IICorps at its flank, pursued {{and tried to}} cut off the German forces on their way toward the town of Dijon, while the Germans planned to prevent another Montélimar with a defensive shield by the 11thPanzer Division. The Allied 45th and 3rdDivisions, as well as the 11thPanzer Division, were racing north to fulfill their objectives. In the meantime, the Germans tried to continue with the evacuation through Lyon. Behind their flight, the Germans destroyed bridges, hoping this <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> down the Allied advance. However, the 45thDivision was able to bypass the German forces, taking the town of Meximieux on 1September. This again posed a threat to the German evacuation. After some initial skirmishes, the 11thPanzer Division launched a heavy attack into the city, causing 215 American casualties and destroying a number of tanks and vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E

5|$|The F-4's biggest weakness, {{as it was}} {{initially}} designed, was its lack of an internal cannon. For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little {{effort was made to}} teach pilots air combat maneuvering. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> down {{in an effort to get}} behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to use multiple shots (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, rules of engagement in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying SUU-16 external gunpods containing a 20mm (.79in) M61A1 Vulcan Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the SUU-23, virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to drag, combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently boresighted, yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20mm (.79in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.|$|E

25|$|All of the Bayou Operations were failures, but Grant {{was known}} for his {{stubborn}} determination and would not quit. His final option was bold but risky: March the army down {{the west side of the}} Mississippi, cross the river south of Vicksburg, and either attack Vicksburg from the south and the east or join forces with Banks, capture Port Hudson, and then together reduce Vicksburg. Porter would have to sneak past the guns to get sufficient gunboats and transport ships south of the city. Once they had completed the downstream passage, they would not be able to return past Vicksburg's guns because the river current <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> them too much.|$|E
25|$|Mississippi's rank {{as one of}} {{the poorest}} states is related to its {{dependence}} on cotton agriculture before and after the Civil War, late development of its frontier bottomlands in the Mississippi Delta, repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century that required massive capital investment in levees, and ditching and draining the bottomlands, and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities. In addition, when Democrats regained control of the state legislature, they passed the 1890 constitution that discouraged corporate industrial development in favor of rural agriculture, a legacy that <b>would</b> <b>slow</b> the state's progress for years.|$|E
