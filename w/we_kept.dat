25|$|One {{can think}} of each row {{operation}} as the left product by an elementary matrix. Denoting by B the product of these elementary matrices, we showed, on the left, that BA = I, and therefore, B = A−1. On the right, <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> a record of BI = B, which we know is the inverse desired. This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.|$|E

Ben came to the session, and he can't really play keyboards very well-he's really more of a drummer-but after that day, <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> in touch, and we just sort of clicked as writers.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} counter {{some of the}} darker aspects of the script, Shiban and Spotnitz—on the behest of co-star David Duchovny—added several bits of comic relief to be offered by Mulder.

5000|$|According to writer Joseph Stein, the {{production}} at the Signature Theatre [...] "...just didn't work properly...I {{made a lot of}} changes, and the third act of the play practically doesn't exist in the musical.

500|$|The Beefeater Gin Trophy was {{presented}} by Denis Thatcher. [...] Grundy {{said of his}} crab: [...] "I feathered my oar after a stroke and the tip caught the water, which plunged it back in."

500|$|I saw a {{video on}} YouTube. [...] had a plain {{background}} {{and it was}} shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> {{a lot of the}} Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture...It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.|$|E
500|$|One day, bassist Mike Dirnt was in {{the studio}} {{recording}} a 30-second song by himself. Armstrong decided {{that he wanted to}} do the same, and drummer Tré Cool followed suit. Armstrong recalled, [...] "It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> connecting these little half-minute bits until we had something." [...] This musical suite became [...] "Homecoming", and the group subsequently wrote another suite, [...] "Jesus of Suburbia".|$|E
6000|$|At York, we {{were put}} in the gaol, where <b>we</b> were <b>kept</b> three weeks. Our {{treatment}} was every way bad, with the exception {{that we were not}} crowded. As to food, <b>we</b> were <b>kept</b> [...] "six upon four" [...] the whole time I was prisoner.[9] The bread was bad, and the pork little better. While in this gaol, a party of drunken Indians gave us a volley, in passing; but luckily it did us no harm.|$|R

500|$|Guitarist Kirk Hammett {{commented on}} the lack of guitar solos on St. Anger, a {{departure}} from what Metallica had done in the past: [...] "We wanted to preserve the sound of all four of us in a room just jamming. We tried to put guitar solos on, but <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought." [...] Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, [...] "We made a promise to ourselves that we'd only keep stuff that had integrity. We didn't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs." ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{traveled}} {{to face the}} Los Angeles Rams on November 11, winning 31–7 in front of 64,632 fans at Anaheim Stadium and led by Simms' efficient passing. The Rams had beaten the Giants {{three times in the}} past two years, including a win in the 1989 playoffs. Although the Giants were able to sack Rams quarterback Jim Everett just twice, they limited him to 17-of-36 passing for 186yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions. [...] "It's hard to sack him", Belichick said. [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> the pressure on. We had the same coverage we used the last eight years. Nothing radically different." ...|$|E

500|$|The costume {{designer}} created all of Hathaway's outfits from scratch, and [...] "looked for {{images of a}} young Jane Austen." [...] Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh explained, [...] "I wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress. But crucially there was also her strength of character. So <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> away from frills and flounces. I wanted a definite look that was quite strong but also pretty at the same time. Jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well. In terms of the costume we were definitely trying to steer away from the chocolate box image that we associate with Jane Austen." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 19, 2009, the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office {{issued a}} report of an {{internal}} investigation that cleared its deputies of any wrongdoing in the Berwyn Heights raid.

[...] Jackson's explanation did not address the fact that the package was intercepted in the FedEx warehouse and delivered under police supervision.|$|E
500|$|Over 2014, Maroon 5 {{continued}} their collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Max Martin {{and others to}} release their fifth studio album, entitled V. Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with Overexposed, saying: [...] "We developed a really nice system on the last record — we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them [...] this time <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> it going but looked for different types of songs." [...] Five singles were released from it. In support of the album, the band undertook the Maroon 5 World Tour 2015, which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015.|$|E

500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I {{had a field day}} every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E
500|$|Orci also said, [...] "The comic has {{the themes}} of enemies uniting to fight a common enemy and has the setting of that {{specific}} time period, so <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> the inspiration from all of that. In terms of {{the specifics of the}} story and who these characters are, we wanted the audience to be surprised and to not feel like they've already seen everything if they were fans of the comic. So, while the themes and the setting and many of the elements are a great inspiration, the story is completely adapted and translated for live action." [...] The aliens were loosely based on the Anunnaki gods of Zecharia Sitchin's interpretation of the Babylonian religion, who have a distinct interest in gold.|$|E

500|$|Lindala {{also created}} [...] "Baby Mutato" [...] costumes for the twin infants {{featured}} in The Jerry Springer Show scene, but the production crew had difficulty keeping the costumes on the children. Lindala later said, [...] "he little babies kept tearing their hair off, <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> gluing it back on". Lindala was happy that the episode was filmed {{in black and}} white because it helped [...] "the prosthetic [...] it is difficult to work in a foam piece that long and not recognize it as a painted, opaque, false translucency." [...] Lindala later called the filming technique the [...] "saving grace" [...] of the episode. In addition, he later submitted his makeup for the episode to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in an attempt to be nominated for an Emmy Award.|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
