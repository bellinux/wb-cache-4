5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who <b>was</b> <b>superior,</b> a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar <b>was</b> <b>superior.</b> Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E

In the growing process of the digital content industry, using resources efficiently and investing innovation activities are the essential factors in operation performance, R&D performance, and human performance. We build the research framework based on the resource-based theory in accordance with innovative technology and human resource, and explore the effect of resources on the performances about sustained advantage. The paper adopts the method of case study to investigate current situations {{about the relationship between}} resource features and performance in digital content industry. The result shows six propositions. (1) An organization with valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable product upgrade could <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> operation performance. (2) An organization with valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable IP rights could <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> operation performance. (3) An organization with valuable and rare disruptive innovation could <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> R&D performance. (4) An organization with valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitute R&D input could <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> R&D performance.

This {{performance}} attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to Maurice Greene's season's best that year.|$|E

At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957. The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing the weakness of the New Zealand team.|$|E

30|$|Consider the {{following}} three cases: First, the conditional mean regression shows that State I <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> to State II and that proposition is correct directly. Second, the quantile regression shows that state I <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> to state II, and the proposition is correct. Thirdly, the conditional mean regression shows that State III <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> to State II and the quantile regression shows that State I is better than State III. One can then conclude that State I is better than State II. As a result, the proposition holds through the transitivity.|$|R

5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to quinine in {{both children and}} adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
5|$|The Russian force <b>was</b> <b>superior,</b> but faced severe {{logistical}} problems. Count Paskevich's {{army was}} too big to sustain on food confiscated from captured lands. It relied on provisions transported from Russia, either directly through Polish territory or theoretically neutral Prussia. The epidemic of cholera brought to Poland and East Prussia by Russian soldiers forced the Prussian authorities to close their borders to Russian transports. To avoid starving his army, Paskevich ordered two permanent bridges built across the Vistula, in Góra and Podgórze. Only the latter one had been completed {{by the start of}} the Russian assault of Warsaw.|$|E

Unusually for biplanes, all three types possessed retractable landing gear. The evaluation showed that the design from Curtiss <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to the Grumman and Great Lakes designs, and an order was placed for the Curtiss type, designated SBC-3 Helldiver in service, in August 1936.|$|E

5|$|A Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 {{warships}} of over 50 guns, 21 {{of less than}} 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left Visby, the main port on Gotland, to join up with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between {{the southern tip of}} Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of Rügen to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive battle at Bornholm. The Swedish force <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> in numbers but was unable to inflict any serious losses, and two of the fleet's fireships were captured, one by the allies and the other by a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title {{to a piece of}} {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State Court proceedings. Hinde claimed that Vattier tried to use the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to have a bill of sale and title that <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde.|$|E

5|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a socio-economic status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E

Palmer from the Armored Force, and Gladeon M. Barnes from the Ordnance Department. He spoke with key British generals including Harold Alexander, Bernard Montgomery and Richard McCreery, and American commanders including Eisenhower, Patton, Thomas B. Larkin and Orlando Ward. Eisenhower was defensive, suspicious that Marshall may have sent Devers to replace him, and nervous when Devers had critical comments about {{the handling of the}} 1st Armored Division. Devers and his party received a great deal of feedback, both positive and negative about American equipment. Devers noted that the M4 Sherman <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to the M3 Lee that the 1st Armored Division was equipped with, but urged the development of the more powerful 76mm gun.|$|E
5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology.

Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
