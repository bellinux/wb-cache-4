6000|$|I have {{therefore}} {{thought it}} advisable {{to provide you}} with a catalogue of the real crimes of England; and I have selected them on a principle which cannot fail to interest and please you. On many occasions <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> wrong indeed. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we took part in preventing Europe from putting a term to the impious piracies of Frederick the Great. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we allowed the triumph over Napoleon to be soiled with the mire and blood of Blucher's sullen savages. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we allowed the peaceful King of Denmark to be robbed in broad daylight by a brigand named Bismarck; and when we allowed the Prussian swashbucklers to enslave and silence the French provinces which they could neither govern nor persuade. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we flung to such hungry adventurers a position so important as Heligoland. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we praised the soulless Prussian education and copied the soulless Prussian laws. Knowing that you will mingle your tears with mine over this record of English wrong-doing, I dedicate it to you, and I remain, ...|$|R

500|$|In 1911, {{three years}} after helium was first liquefied, Onnes working at University of Leiden {{discovered}} superconductivity in mercury, when he observed the electrical resistivity of mercury to vanish at temperatures below a certain value. The phenomenon completely surprised the best theoretical physicists of the time, and it remained unexplained for several decades. Albert Einstein, in 1922, said regarding contemporary theories of superconductivity that [...] "with our far-reaching ignorance of the quantum mechanics of composite systems <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> far {{from being able to}} compose a theory out of these vague ideas".|$|E
500|$|Producers {{initially}} noticed chemistry between Blair and Dan in the [...] episode [...] "Bad News Blair". According to producer Joshua Safran, {{the creators}} planned to revisit their relationship once {{the timing was}} right. Safran also stated that the outcome wasn't necessarily decided ahead of time. [...] "One thing <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> conscious of—and I know some fans get upset about this—is we really try to treat the characters as living, breathing, well-rounded individuals. And we're often surprised by where their journeys take them; they open new doors for us all the time." ...|$|E

[...] Babe has got away with many a manipulative scheme over the years, but her treatment of lovely Les and Pam is just one step too far. Because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> much Team Coker over here, we'd like to see Aunt Babe brought down a peg or two. And soon." ...|$|E

The 'think big' brief given to us was apt for {{the launch of the}} final book... The challenge was to not just get existing fans of the franchise to buy The Oath of Vayuputras—that would happen anyway—but to expand the reader base. The campaign idea revolved around creating another 'first-of-its-kind' in book marketing, which this time around {{turned out to be the}} production of a world-class music video which is poised at reaching out to the masses through television, in a bid to garner greater awareness about the book." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was happy}} with his players after they had come from behind to win the match: [...] "It was a {{difficult}} game. We were controlling the game, passing the ball around and then {{we made a mistake}} and had to work really hard to get back. They played well, but I think we controlled the game. To score three goals is not easy. I can say that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> happy now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory." [...] With five days of the transfer window left, Benítez refused to speculate on whether Liverpool would sign Michael Owen, stating, [...] "I like good players, {{we have a lot of}} them here." ...|$|E
500|$|The Upper Peninsula press {{continued}} {{to report on}} Heikkinen’s every move, as he returned home shortly before Christmas, before heading west {{to play in the}} East-West Shrine Game. On his departure for California, The Bessemer Herald said: “Ralph has made every major All America team in the nation this year[...] [...] [...] Our nation has had many great men to emulate. The children of the Ramsay school not only have these in common with all others, but we have our own local hero who has gained national repute as a gentleman, scholar and last, but not least, a great athlete. To say that we are proud of Ralph is putting it mild. We feel that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> honored to have had him as a student of the Ramsay school.” ...|$|E

Taking this approach gives us the opportunity to set an example and share with others the possibilities of real alternatives for a safer, cleaner world. We will see you all very soon for what will be an exciting, chaotic circus of insanity, and an unforgettable tour." ...|$|E
500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is {{going to bring}} us to the verge of {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism." [...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E
500|$|Siegel and Shuster {{compared}} Superman's {{strength and}} leaping abilities {{to those of}} an ant and a grasshopper, respectively, as did Abednego for his son.

In order to keep his true [...] "experimental" [...] origins a secret, he tells his Legionnaire superiors, [...] " [...] place in America. A place that has scarcely been explored. I was born there. All the men of Colorado are born as I was born and are like me. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> strong. We are great fighters. We cannot be wounded except by the largest shells." [...] Other examples of similarities include both of their biological fathers are scientists (Jor-El and Abednego), both grow up in rural settings (Smallville and Indian Creek, Colorado), both are imbued with a strong moral compass from a young age both lift cars over their heads, and both hide their powers from the world.|$|E

500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> happy to win, but we do not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E
500|$|Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim {{expressed}} his delight following his side's victory. He {{was interviewed by}} the Turkish press and dedicated the cup to Turkey and its public, particularly to those {{who lost their lives}} during the 1999 İzmit earthquake: [...] "Many people suffered terribly in the earthquake in Turkey last year and if this victory brings some happiness back into their lives then I am delighted and so are all the players. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> proud if we are able to help the Turkish people in some small way and this victory is for the whole country and all of the soccer fans in Turkey. I believe they were all united behind us." [...] Terim also praised his own players and Taffarel: [...] "I am proud and delighted he is in my team. He was magnificent and thoroughly deserved to be man of the match". Popescu, a former defender of Tottenham Hotspur, also indulged in the triumph and said: [...] "I am sure the fans at my old club are delighted as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|Carson {{returned}} to Liverpool {{at the end}} of the season and in June 2007, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez confirmed that he would be part of the first-team squad for the 2007–08 season, saying [...] "He must fight with Pepe Reina now for a starting place." [...] Carson remained second choice to Reina, however, and faced further competition following the signing of Charles Itandje in August 2007; as a result, Carson was loaned out again, this time to Aston Villa at a cost to Villa of £2million. Benitez said of the deal, [...] "We do not want to sell him, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> happy with Scott. But he needs to play to keep up his England place." [...] Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill preferred Carson to Thomas Sørensen and Stuart Taylor, and Carson played in all but three of Villa's 38 league matches, missing the two matches against Liverpool as he was ineligible to play, and kept 11 clean sheets during the 2007–08 season. He received the first red card of his career when he fouled Carlos Tevez in Villa's 4–1 Premier League defeat to Manchester United.|$|E

500|$|Mayor Daley said on May 10, 2006 {{that the}} Olympics [...] "cannot become a {{financial}} burden {{to the taxpayers}} of Chicago and Illinois." [...] "The {{goal is to have}} the Olympics be totally privately funded and we have unparalleled support from the business community," [...] a mayoral spokeswoman said in July 2006. Daley insisted that no tax money would be used to pay for the city to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and said funding from the private sector and federal dollars for security and infrastructure would cover the costs. [...] "Tax money isn't paying for it," [...] Daley said on February 7, 2009. [...] "The federal government pays for security, which is the highest cost of the Olympics ... The other thing they pay for is infrastructure ... There's no city tax money whatsoever ... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> strong in that position ... in the regard to having that be sponsored by the private sector and others." [...] In previous years, Daley opposed possible bids for the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games owing to former international committee financial-guarantee requirements. The 2016 financial guarantee requirements were not initially formalized.|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
