5|$|In 1985, five tammar <b>wallabies</b> were {{introduced}} onto North Island, {{and the population}} established successfully. Possible reasons for this success include {{the absence of the}} wallabies' natural predator, the carpet python (Morelia spilota imbricata); the availability of additional food and water from the fishers' huts, which are occupied during the harshest time of the year; and the presence of the air strip, which apparently provides additional food for them. By the 2000s, there were over 450 tammar <b>wallabies</b> on the island. The <b>wallabies</b> overgrazed and ringbarked the native vegetation, particularly the area burnt in 1935, thus reducing vegetation cover and causing a serious decline in populations of some plant species. In 2003, island residents asked the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM; now the Department of Environment and Conservation) for help in managing the issue. CALM staff visited the island in April and May of that year and produced a report recommending an investigation into controlling population levels by the use of implanted contraceptives. Exploration of this option began in 2005, but in July 2007 the research was discontinued. Around 60 <b>wallabies</b> were removed to educational institutions for research purposes, and culling began. By February 2008, the wallaby population had been reduced to around 25 individuals.|$|E

50|$|The agile <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus agilis) {{also known}} as the sandy <b>wallaby,</b> is a species of <b>wallaby</b> found in {{northern}} Australia and New Guinea. It is the most common <b>wallaby</b> in Australia's north. The agile <b>wallaby</b> is a sandy colour becoming paler below. It is sometimes solitary and at other times sociable and grazes on grasses and other plants. The agile <b>wallaby</b> is not considered threatened.|$|R
5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar <b>wallabies</b> died {{suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar <b>wallabies</b> in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E

5|$|In 1952 he was {{selected}} for the domestic series against Fiji and later that year again toured New Zealand with the <b>Wallabies.</b> He played in nine of Australia's ten tour matches in New Zealand. The <b>Wallabies</b> lost only two of their matches, a game against Southland, and their second Test against the All Blacks. In the first Test Windon harassed the New Zealand fly-half with his aggressive defence, and pounced on a loose ball to score a try after the ball was dropped following a mistimed All Blacks' back-line move. The New Zealanders adjusted to Australia's tactics to win the second Test 15–8, but Windon did get the consolation of another try.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} nail-tail <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea unguifera) {{also known}} as the sandy nail-tail <b>wallaby,</b> is a species of macropod found in Queensland, Western Australia and Northern Territory.

5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the <b>Wallabies.</b> He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the <b>Wallabies</b> defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Wales again won the Home Championship, {{and later}} that year played the South African {{national}} side, the Springboks for the first time. Wales were favourites to win the match, but instead South Africa dominated in the forwards and eventually won 11–0. Two years later, on 12 December 1908, Wales played the touring Australians, the <b>Wallabies,</b> who they defeated 9–6.|$|E

5|$|Rugby {{union was}} not {{played at the}} 1904 games in St. Louis, nor at the 1906 Intercalated Games, but was {{included}} in 1908, when the Olympics were held in the sport's native country. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) {{was involved in the}} organization of the sport at this edition of the Olympics. Like the 1900 games, three teams entered: Australasia (representing Australia and New Zealand), France, and hosts Great Britain (which included the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). France pulled out prior to the commencement of the tournament, being unable to field a representative team. Australasia was represented by the <b>Wallabies,</b> who were already on tour in Britain. As the best English and Welsh players were on tour in New Zealand at the time, Great Britain was represented by the Cornwall county team, who were chosen by the RFU as an appropriate side after they defeated Durham in the 1907 English county championship. The choice of Cornwall was controversial, as only three of their players had ever represented England and the <b>Wallabies</b> had defeated them 18 points to five.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 season {{started off}} with two mid-year tests against France. New Zealand won the tests 42–11 at Eden Park and 61–10 at Westpac Stadium. A third game, against Canada, {{resulted}} in a 64–13 win, although the game was more competitive than the scoreline indicated. New Zealand's first Tri-Nations game of 2007 was against the Springboks in Durban, South Africa. New Zealand scored two tries in the final ten minutes of the game to win 26–21. The following week against the <b>Wallabies</b> at the Melbourne Cricket Ground the <b>Wallabies</b> upset New Zealand to win 20–15, New Zealand's first loss to Australia since 2004. The All Blacks won their following home games to successfully defend the Tri-Nations Series for 2007. New Zealand entered the 2007 Rugby World Cup as favourites, and topped their pool, beating Scotland, Italy, Romania and Portugal by at least 40 points. However, they then suffered a defeat by hosts France in the quarter-finals in Cardiff. Following the loss to France coach Graham Henry's job was reappointed amid vocal debate and comment, despite then Crusaders coach Robbie Deans being a strong contender.|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and <b>wallabies)</b> and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.|$|E

40|$|Non-invasive {{methods of}} {{monitoring}} wild populations (such as genotyping faeces or hair) are now widely used and advocated. The potential advantages of such methods over traditional direct monitoring (such as live capture) are that accuracy improves because sampling of non-trappable individuals may be possible, species in difficult and remote terrain can be surveyed more efficiently, and disturbance to animals is minimal. Few studies have assessed {{the effects of}} interactions between species on remote sampling success. We test the use of non-invasive monitoring for the cryptic, forest-dwelling, solitary and endangered bridled nailtail <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea fraenata) that is sympatric with the ecologically similar and more common black-striped <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus dorsalis). Six types of hair traps were tested for 3668 trap days, and hairs were caught with about a 10 % success rate. Camera traps showed that baited hair traps targeted both <b>wallaby</b> species. We microscopically identified hair as bridled nailtail <b>wallaby</b> or black-striped <b>wallaby.</b> We compared these hairs and their genotypes (using seven microsatellite loci) with known bridled nailtail <b>wallaby</b> hairs and genotypes derived from animal trapping. Trapped bridled nailtail <b>wallaby</b> hairs had characteristics that could be mistaken for black-stripe <b>wallaby</b> hairs; characteristics were not diagnostic. Genetic assignment tests consistently differentiated the known bridled nailtail <b>wallaby</b> samples from identified black-striped <b>wallaby</b> samples, however genetic overlap between most of the microsatellite markers means {{that they are not}} suitable for species identification of single samples, {{with the possible exception of}} the microsatellite locus B 151. With similar trapping effort and within the same area, live-capture mark-recapture techniques estimated 40 - 60 individuals and non-invasive methods only detected 14 genotypes. A species-specific genetic marker would allow more efficient targeting of bridled nailtail <b>wallaby</b> samples and increase capture rates...|$|R
5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the <b>wallabies</b> in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The limited (2 X) {{coverage}} of the tammar <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus eugenii) genome sequence dataset currently presents a challenge for assembly and anchoring onto chromosomes. To {{provide a framework for}} this assembly, {{it would be a great}} advantage to have a dense map of the tammar <b>wallaby</b> genome. However, only limited mapping data are available for this non-model species, comprising a physical map and a linkage map. Results We combined all available tammar <b>wallaby</b> mapping data to create a tammar <b>wallaby</b> integrated map, using the Location DataBase (LDB) strategy. This first-generation integrated map combines all available information from the second-generation tammar <b>wallaby</b> linkage map with 148 loci, and extensive FISH mapping data for 492 loci, especially for genes likely to be located at the ends of <b>wallaby</b> chromosomes or at evolutionary breakpoints inferred from comparative information. For loci whose positions are only approximately known, their location in the integrated map was refined on the basis of comparative information from opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and human. Interpolation of segments from the opossum and human assemblies into the integrated map enabled the subsequent construction of a tammar <b>wallaby</b> first-generation virtual genome map, which comprises 14336 markers, including 13783 genes recruited from opossum and human assemblies. Both maps are freely available at [URL]. Conclusions The first-generation integrated map and the first-generation virtual genome map provide a backbone for the chromosome assembly of the tammar <b>wallaby</b> genome sequence. For example, 78 % of the 10257 gene-scaffolds in the Ensembl annotation of the tammar <b>wallaby</b> genome sequence (including 10522 protein-coding genes) can now be given a chromosome location in the tammar <b>wallaby</b> virtual genome map. </p...|$|R
