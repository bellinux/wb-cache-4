5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of bad things Bart <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", a {{marathon}} twelve-minute opus which was edited for single release in some countries. The track {{begins with a}} guitar played {{to sound like a}} revving motorcycle, a reference to Todd Rundgren's contribution in the middle of [...] "Bat Out of Hell". Each verse comprises two things that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> love, followed by one thing that he would not do. It is that latter parts of each chorus that is the [...] "that" [...] of the title. However, some people misunderstand the lyrics, claiming that the singer never identifies what the [...] "that" [...] is that he is unwilling to do, a confusion that Steinman predicted during production. The song combines stadium rock and ballad for much of its twelve minutes. However, {{near the end of the}} song, a female vocalist is introduced. Credited in the liner notes as Mrs. Loud, this part was sung by Lorraine Crosby.|$|E

In the opening scenes, Bieber is wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, similar to the gray one he wore in the [...] "One Time" [...] video, along with a cranberry shirt. One day while he is waiting for his clothes and is tuning his guitar, she drops a scarf, and he picks it up. In the laundromat scene Bieber is wearing a mixed purple, blue & orange plaid collared shirt, with a dark purple tee. The girl comes {{back the next day}} however he is not there. He then posts a sign beside the washer that he found her missing scarf. He leads the girl on a scavenger hunt for the scarf, posting signs with pictures of him on them around the town to encourage her to go on a date with him.

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. The first session on Friday {{started on a}} damp track, described by Sebastian Vettel as [...] "ridiculously slippery", with the first half-hour of running done on intermediate tyres. Valtteri Bottas set the fastest time on those tyres, before all teams switched on the medium compound. Even on the dry tyres, still many drivers were fooled by the conditions, going off at turns 8 and 10 in particular. Nico Rosberg's Mercedes suffered from overheating rear brakes, forcing {{him back to the}} pit lane while he held the fastest time. Carlos Sainz Jr. recorded the most timed laps with 37, and finished eighth fastest, ahead of local favourite Sergio Pérez and Felipe Massa. Jolyon Palmer again replaced Romain Grosjean at the wheel of the Lotus, as he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the season, and finished fifteenth fastest, 0.2 seconds slower than teammate Pastor Maldonado. The fastest time of the session was set by Max Verstappen in the Toro Rosso, at 1:25.990, even though he went off in the second sector of the track. He was followed by Daniil Kvyat and the two Ferrari cars of Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel. While Rosberg was demoted to sixth, newly crowned World Champion Lewis Hamilton was only eleventh fastest.|$|E
500|$|... "Melt Away" [...] was a song Carey {{produced}} on her own, and co-wrote with Babyface. The song's writing and production were [...] "superb". with each verse gliding into its chorus.

[...] Another song that brought back reminders of older decades was [...] "Forever". The throwback was featured through the chord changes and in the way the guitar arpeggios [...] "stayed {{at the forefront of the}} music." [...] The song displayed subtle vocals from Carey, as well as an undeniable richness. [...] "Daydream Interlude (Sweet Fantasy Dub Mix)" [...] was one of the liveliest tracks on the album. The song was a club remix of [...] "Fantasy", which was tuned and remixed by famed house music producer David Morales. The song was directed to be a dance-club song, further broadening Carey's [...] "musical horizon". The song incorporated Carey's vocals, and added them to a thumping house beat, something he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> many of her future singles. [...] "Looking In" [...] was the final song on the album.
