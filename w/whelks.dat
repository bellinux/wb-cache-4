5|$|Invertebrates {{including}} cephalopods like squid and octopus; crustaceans such as prawns, crabs, and lobsters; and bivalve or gastropod molluscs such as clams, oysters, cockles, and <b>whelks</b> are all hunted or farmed for food.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as <b>whelks</b> and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E

5|$|Predators of {{the leopard}} {{catshark}} include larger sharks and marine mammals; {{it is one}} of the cartilaginous fish most often consumed by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). When threatened, it curls into a ring with its tail covering its head, a behavior also performed by the shysharks (Haploblepharus). Its eggs are also heavily preyed upon, by animals such as the <b>whelks</b> Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, which can pierce the outer covering to extract the yolk. This species is known to be parasitized by the praniza larvae of the isopod Gnathia pantherina, which infest the nostrils, mouth, and gills.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of the puffadder shyshark are fed {{upon by the}} <b>whelks</b> Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, {{at least}} in captivity. Known parasites of this species include the {{trypanosome}} Trypanosoma haploblephari, which infests the blood, the nematode Proleptus obtusus, which infests the intestine, and the copepods Charopinus dalmanni and Perissopus oblongatus, which infest the skin. Another parasite is the praniza larval stage of the isopod Gnathia pantherina, which infests the nares, mouth, and gills. The deep-penetrating mouthparts of these larvae significantly damage local tissue, causing bleeding and inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Rather slow-swimming, the pyjama shark {{spends most}} of the day resting in caves or crevices or amongst kelp, {{emerging}} at night to actively forage for food. Many individuals may congregate at a single spot, particularly in summer. This species falls prey to larger sharks, {{and is one of the}} cartilaginous fish most frequently consumed by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). When threatened, it often curls into a circle with its tail covering its head, in a similar fashion to the shysharks (Haploblepharus). Its eggs are fed upon by the <b>whelks</b> Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, which can pierce the outer covering to extract the yolk within. Like other sharks, the pyjama shark maintains osmotic balance with the environment by regulating its internal concentration of urea and other nitrogenous wastes. Experiments have shown that the shark's capacity for osmoregulation is dependent on how well it has fed.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "wampum" [...] {{refers to}} beads made from purple and white mollusk shells. Species {{used to make}} wampum include the highly prized quahog clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) which {{produces}} the famous purple colored beads. For white colored beads the shells from the channeled <b>whelk</b> (Busycon canaliculatum), knobbed <b>whelk</b> (Busycon carica), lightning <b>whelk</b> (Busycon sinistrum), and snow <b>whelk</b> (Busycon Laeostomum) are used.|$|R

25|$|Around the mid-18th century, {{goods and}} {{passengers}} {{began to be}} transported by ship between London and Whitstable, and a toll road was built to the cathedral city of Canterbury. These improvements in transport led to the town's development as a seaside resort; the first advertisements for bathing machines at Whitstable appeared in 1768. In 1790 the manor was sold to private landowners, and three years later the rights to harvest the oyster beds were bought by the newly established Company of Free Fishers and Dredgers of Whitstable, the successor to the Whitstable Company of Dredgers. Between roughly 1775 and 1875 the well smacks or early longliners out of Barking and other local fishing ports would collect lugworms and <b>whelks</b> from Whitstable's bait-diggers and dredgers before beginning their tour for prime fish north to Iceland. <b>Whelks</b> suspended in net bags in the well could live for a while due to circulating fresh water.|$|E

25|$|The first Norman {{fishing port}} of {{shellfish}} (clams, <b>whelks,</b> dog cockles, Saint-Jacques scallops), crustaceans (lobsters, brown crabs, small crabs, spider crabs) and fish (bream, rays, sharks, soles, pollock, bass, red mullet, cod, cuttlefish and squid) for local consumption with a fish market, a refrigerating terminal and a computerised sale of products. The tonnage landed (excluding farming) {{is of the}} order of 16,000 tonnes per year. An average of seventy-five equipped vessels with nearly 450 professional sailors attend the port. The marine cultures present on the islands of Chausey produce nearly 250 tons of clams, 5,000 tonnes of mussels and 100 tons of oysters.|$|E
25|$|In marine mussels, {{the foot}} is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is {{continuous}} with the byssus pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate {{allowing it to}} remain sessile in areas of high flow. The byssal thread is also sometimes used by mussels as a defensive measure, to tether predatory molluscs, such as dog <b>whelks,</b> that invade mussel beds, immobilising them and thus starving them to death.|$|E
500|$|Other bivalves, such as mussels, attach {{themselves}} to hard surfaces using tough byssus threads made of keratin and proteins. They are more exposed to attack by predators than the burrowing bivalves. Certain carnivorous gastropod snails such as <b>whelks</b> (Buccinidae) and murex snails (Muricidae) feed on bivalves by boring into their shells, although many Busyconine <b>whelks</b> (e.g., Busycon sinistrum, Busycon carica) are [...] "chipping-style" [...] predators. The dog whelk (Nucella lamellosa) drills a hole with its radula assisted by a shell-dissolving secretion. The dog whelk then inserts its extendible proboscis and sucks out the body {{contents of the}} victim, which is typically a blue mussel. The whelk needs {{a few hours to}} penetrate the shell and thus living in the littoral zone is an advantage to the bivalve because the gastropod can attempt to bore through the shell only when the tide is in.|$|E
50|$|The channeled <b>whelk,</b> Busycotypus canaliculatus, {{previously}} {{known as}} Busycon canaliculatum, {{is a very}} large predatory sea snail, a marine prosobranch gastropod, a busycon <b>whelk,</b> belonging to the family Busyconidae.|$|R

40|$|In Korea, common <b>whelk</b> (Buccinum undatum) is {{a popular}} edible shellfish. The {{aim of this study}} was to observe the {{sensitization}} rate to common <b>whelk</b> and to characterize its allergens. We carried out skin prick test (SPT) in 1, 700 patients with various allergic diseases. Specific IgE were detected by ELISA in the patient sera and ELISA inhibition tests were conducted. IgE-binding components were identified by means of SDS-PAGE and IgE-immunoblotting. The effects of digestive enzymes were evaluated in both raw and thermally treated extracts. SPT to common <b>whelk</b> was positive (≥ 2 +) in 83 (4. 9 %) patients studied. Twenty-four (38. 7 %) out of 62 SPT positive patients had high serum specific IgE to common <b>whelk.</b> ELISA inhibition test showed significant inhibitions by abalone as well as by common <b>whelk.</b> IgE-immunoblotting demonstrated three IgE-binding components (40, 71, 82 kDa), which were digested by simulated intestinal fluid and moderately digested by simulated gastric fluid, and the digestibility of allergens remained unchanged after thermal treatment. In conclusion, IgE-sensitization rate to common <b>whelk</b> was 4. 9 % in allergy patients. IgE-immunoblotting demonstrated three IgE-binding components, which were degraded by digestive enzymes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of the sensitized patients to common <b>whelk...</b>|$|R
500|$|Molluscs, {{especially}} bivalves such as {{clams and}} mussels, {{have been an}} important food source {{since at least the}} advent of anatomically modern humans, and this has often resulted in overfishing. Other commonly eaten molluscs include octopuses and squids, <b>whelks,</b> oysters, and scallops. In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global mollusc catch, netting almost [...] Within Europe, France remained the industry leader. Some countries regulate importation and handling of molluscs and other seafood, mainly to minimize the poison risk from toxins that can sometimes accumulate in the animals.|$|E
500|$|The dark shyshark is a generalist {{predator}} {{whose main}} food sources are, {{in descending order}} of importance, small benthic crustaceans, bony fishes, and molluscs. Larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans. Polychaete worms and echinoderms are also taken on occasion, and algae may be swallowed incidentally. This species is preyed upon by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and potentially also other large fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, it adopts a characteristic defense posture in which it curls into a ring with its tail over its eyes; this behavior likely makes the shark harder to swallow and is {{the origin of the}} common names [...] "shyshark" [...] and [...] "doughnut". In captivity, the <b>whelks</b> Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria have been documented piercing the egg cases of this species and extracting the yolk. A known parasite of the dark shyshark is the trypanosome Trypanosoma haploblephari, which infests the blood.|$|E
500|$|The {{estuaries}} act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, <b>whelks,</b> cockles, and snails {{thrive in}} these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a $59million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a $22million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. [...] Between 80 and 90percent {{of species that}} are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem {{to build up the}} coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.|$|E

500|$|The {{greatest}} literary strengths in Tipping the Velvet, {{according to}} reviewers and literary scholars, are the vibrant {{portrayal of the}} districts and streets of London, and Waters' ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters. Her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in The Women's Review of Books. For example, Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty, removing her glove to shake Kitty's hand. Very much an oyster girl, Nan's hands are covered with [...] "those rank sea-scents, of liquor and oyster-flesh, crab-meat and <b>whelks,</b> which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family {{for so many years}} we had ceased, entirely, to notice them." [...] Nan is mortified that she smells like a herring, but Kitty assuages her fears, kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid. Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights, sounds, and smells in Victorian London as examples of elements that are [...] "breathlessly and wittily detailed".|$|E
