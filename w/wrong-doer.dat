25|$|The main crimes {{normally}} concerned drunkenness, {{theft and}} general misbehaviour. The <b>wrong-doer</b> may be punished by running the gauntlet which involved being flogged by one's own regiment {{as he passed}} between two lines of soldiers. In 1765 a soldier was picquetted (made to stand on a tent-peg) without shoes for drunken misconduct.|$|E
2500|$|In Sykes v Walls , a {{claim of}} {{wrongful}} detention by a bailee was upheld as a good claim {{on the ground that}} a refusal to deliver up constituted a [...] "misfeasance". [...] By this case, trover became virtually concurrent with detinue. [...] When a chattel had been found, and there was a subsequent refusal to deliver it to the owner, it was taken as evidence that a conversion had occurred. Trover was a wrong against the right of possession and not against the possession itself, because possession was prima facie in the <b>wrong-doer.</b> Even when trover was allowed to overlap trespass and replevin, which were concerned with possession, it remained necessary to define conversion, and this extension did not really affect the definition. Conversion became any act {{on the part of the}} defendant inconsistent with the plaintiff's right to possession. [...] This right had parts: [...] it had to be (1) absolute and (2) immediate.|$|E

60|$|And {{yet there}} was {{something}} about him, something in his atmosphere, so to speak, that I did not like. Before we parted that evening I felt sure that {{in one way or another}} he was a <b>wrong-doer,</b> not straight; also that he had a violent temper.|$|E

60|$|Now, Felicity {{for once}} was {{undoubtedly}} right. The Story Girl's suggestion WAS wrong; {{and if it}} had been Cecily who protested, the Story Girl would probably have listened to her, and proceeded no further in the matter. But Felicity was one of those unfortunate people whose protests against wrong-doing serve only to drive the <b>wrong-doer</b> further on her sinful way.|$|E
60|$|Of Luke's {{overbearing}} {{cousin and}} his dishonest uncle much {{might be said}} which Luke leaves untold. The boy does this probably out of his natural good-heartedness. Yet {{the lives of the}} pair, and especially that of the father, well illustrate the old saying, that, sooner or later, every <b>wrong-doer</b> is bound to overreach himself and {{fall into the hands of}} justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I perceive," [...] whispered his dragoman, [...] "that I {{must make}} clear {{to you the}} spirit which animates our justice in these matters. You know, of course, that the {{intention}} of our law is ever to penalise the <b>wrong-doer.</b> It therefore requires the innocent party, like that lady there, to be exceptionally innocent, not only before she secures her divorce, but for six months afterwards." ...|$|E

60|$|These {{and many}} {{analogous}} considerations might {{be presented to}} the child, going to show that, whatever the rule of strict justice in respect to the criminal may enjoin, it is not right to take the life of a <b>wrong-doer</b> merely to prevent the commission of a minor offense. The law of the land recognizes this principle, and does not justify the taking of life except in extreme cases, such as those of imminent personal danger.|$|E
60|$|A sort of {{necessary}} {{order in the}} development of Genius is, first, Complaint; second, Plaint; third, Love. Complaint, which is the condition of Persius, lies not in the province of poetry. Erelong the enjoyment of a superior good would have changed his disgust into regret. We can never have much sympathy with the complainer; for after searching nature through, we conclude that he must be both plaintiff and defendant too, and so had best come to a settlement without a hearing. He who receives an injury is to some extent an accomplice of the <b>wrong-doer.</b>|$|E
60|$|The early English {{society was}} founded {{entirely on the}} tie of blood. Every clan or family lived by itself and formed a guild for mutual protection, each kinsman being his brother's keeper, and bound to avenge his death by feud with the tribe or clan which had killed him. This duty of blood-revenge was the supreme {{religion}} of the race. Moreover, the clan was answerable as a whole for the ill-deeds of all its members; and the fine payable for murder or injury was handed over by {{the family of the}} <b>wrong-doer</b> to the family of the injured man.|$|E
60|$|When {{he first}} perceived, by {{the dim light}} of a street lamp, two persons {{standing}} together on his side of the street, his conscience, without any reason for it, suggested that he cross over and pass by without attracting attention. To <b>wrong-doers</b> attention is generally unwelcome.|$|R
50|$|Ganesan (Vignesh), is an irresponsible {{youth in}} a village. He {{promises}} his mother (Kuyili) {{that he would}} be good and start earning.

60|$|This {{principle}} is eminently true in {{its application to}} children. They need {{the influence of a}} kind and considerate sympathy when they have done wrong, more, perhaps, than at any other time; and the effects of the proper manifestation of this sympathy {{on the part of the}} mother will, perhaps, be greater and more salutary in this case than in any other. Of course the sympathy must be of the right kind, and must be expressed in the right way, so as not to allow the tenderness or compassion for the <b>wrong-doer</b> to be mistaken for approval or justification of the wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you are aware, Watson, {{there is}} no one who knows the higher {{criminal}} world of London so well as I do. For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organizing power which forever stands {{in the way of the}} law, and throws its shield over the <b>wrong-doer.</b> Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts--forgery cases, robberies, murders--I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted. For years I have endeavored to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when I seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity.|$|E
60|$|No {{more could}} be said, and Romola's heart was {{perfectly}} satisfied. Not so Tito's. If the subtle mixture {{of good and}} evil prepares suffering for human truth and purity, there is also suffering prepared for the <b>wrong-doer</b> by the same mingled conditions. As Tito kissed Romola on their parting that evening, the very strength of the thrill that moved his whole being at the sense that this woman, whose beauty it was hardly possible to think of as anything but the necessary consequence of her noble nature, loved him with all the tenderness that spoke in her clear eyes, brought a strong reaction of regret that he had not kept himself free from that first deceit which had dragged him into the danger of being disgraced before her. There was a spring of bitterness mingling with that fountain of sweets. Would the death of Fra Luca arrest it? He hoped it would.|$|E

5000|$|Tasioulas {{works in}} moral, legal and {{political}} philosophy.

6000|$|The {{principle}} {{on which}} the distinction is made is perfectly clear, [...] {{but in many cases}} persons may be misled chiefly in regard to [...] matters of fact. A clergyman may at first sight be classed as an [...] unproductive laborer; but, until we know the facts, we can not [...] apply the principle of our definition. Unless we know that no [...] clergyman, by inculcating rules of morality and self-control, ever [...] caused an idler or <b>wrong-doer</b> to become a steady laborer, we can [...] not say that a clergyman is a laborer unproductive of material [...] wealth. Likewise the army, or the officers of our government at [...] Washington, {{may or may not have}} aided in producing material wealth [...] according as they do or do not, in fact, accomplish the protective [...] purposes for which they exist. So with teachers. There is, [...] however, no disparagement implied in the word unproductive; it is [...] merely an economic question, and has to do only with forces [...] affecting the production of wealth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] said Psmith. [...] "And now {{to decide}} upon our main scheme. You, of course, are the editor, and my {{suggestions}} are merely suggestions, subject to your approval. But, briefly, my {{idea is that}} Cosy Moments should become red-hot stuff. I could wish its tone to be such that the public will wonder why we do not print it on asbestos. We must chronicle all the live events of the day, murders, fires, and the like in a manner which will make our readers' spines thrill. Above all, we must be the guardians of the People's rights. We must be a search-light, showing up the dark spot in the souls {{of those who would}} endeavour in any way to do the PEOPLE in the eye. We must detect the <b>wrong-doer,</b> and deliver him such a series of resentful buffs that he will abandon his little games and become a model citizen. The details of the campaign we must think out after, but I fancy that, if we follow those main lines, we shall produce a bright, readable little sheet which will in a measure make this city sit up and take notice. Are you with me, Comrade Windsor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lest {{the reader}} should think I was unduly severe upon 'Squire Newcome, let me appeal {{to his own}} experience, and inquire if he never knew, not only individuals, but whole neighborhoods, which were sorely {{addicted}} to prying into every man's affairs, and to inventing when facts did not exactly sustain theories; in a word, convulsing themselves with that with which they have no real concern, draw themselves up in dignified reserve, as the witnesses of wrongs of all sorts, that every honest man is bound to oppose? I will go further, and ask if a man does happen to step forth to vindicate the right, to assert truth, to defend the weak and to punish the <b>wrong-doer,</b> if that man be not usually the one who meddles least in the more ordinary and minor transactions of life--the man who troubles his neighbors least, and has the least to say about their private affairs? Does it not happen that the very individual who will stand by and see his neighbor wronged, {{on account of his}} indisposition to meddle with that which does not belong to him, will occupy a large portion of his own time, in discussing, throwing out hints, and otherwise commenting on the private affairs of that very neighbor? ...|$|E
