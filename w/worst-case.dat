5|$|During the game's ending, Wario's new castle quality {{depends on}} the number of Spiritelings rescued. The <b>worst-case</b> {{scenario}} sees Wario with nothing but a campsite with his throne in a dark jungle, but if all 40 Spritelings were rescued, Wario is given a palace even grander than his previous one.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to legislative reform, the breaching of coastal flood defense systems during Vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms. In Nagoya, regulation {{was created for}} coastal construction and their heights. Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also set into motion. The heights of such defense systems were based on <b>worst-case</b> scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson's {{depression}} returns again, when Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs {{her that}} she has an infection that requires surgery. She rejects the surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the <b>worst-case</b> scenario is that she will need an ostomy pouching system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an {{inspection}} programme was launched (costing £1.2million) {{to assess the}} condition of the main suspension cables after corrosion was discovered in a number of older bridges in the United States of a similar design and size. The study was completed two years later and reported that the main cables had suffered an 8–10% loss of strength. Future projections highlighted the likelihood of this accelerating, with traffic restrictions to limit loading required in 2014 in the <b>worst-case</b> scenario, followed by full closure by 2020.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence. These {{have increased the}} threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not a <b>worst-case</b> scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller <b>worst-case</b> time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid <b>worst-case</b> scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the <b>worst-case</b> scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher {{temperatures}} and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been {{extensive}} research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without <b>worst-case</b> runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. Non-standard computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and adiabatic quantum computation. The maximum clique problem {{was the subject of}} an implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992–1993, and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge is publicly available.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a <b>worst-case</b> scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow for}} track or {{forecast}} uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated {{to create a}} map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums. For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed, are modeled to produce <b>worst-case</b> water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs. These studies have been completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website. They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane {{that will result in}} flooding, in each area of the county.|$|E
5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a <b>worst-case</b> scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E
5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the <b>worst-case</b> scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a <b>worst-case</b> scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E

25|$|Bubble sort has <b>worst-case</b> {{and average}} {{complexity}} both О(n2), where n {{is the number}} of items being sorted. There exist many sorting algorithms, such as merge sort with substantially better <b>worst-case</b> or average complexity of O(nlogn). Even other О(n2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, tend to have better performance than bubble sort. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm when n is large.|$|E
25|$|A {{random access}} list {{is a list}} with support for fast random access to read or modify any element in the list. One {{possible}} implementation is a skew binary random access list using the skew binary number system, which involves a list of trees with special properties; this allows <b>worst-case</b> constant time head/cons operations, and <b>worst-case</b> logarithmic time random access to an element by index. Random access lists can be implemented as persistent data structures.|$|E
25|$|Christofides {{made a big}} {{advance in}} this {{approach}} of giving an approach for which we know the <b>worst-case</b> scenario. Christofides algorithm given in 1976, at worst is 1.5 times longer than the optimal solution. As the algorithm was so simple and quick, many hoped it would {{give way to a}} near optimal solution method. However, until 2011 when it was beaten by less than a billionth of a percent, this remained the method with the best <b>worst-case</b> scenario.|$|E
25|$|The Bron–Kerbosch {{algorithm}} {{is not an}} output-sensitive algorithm: unlike some other algorithms for the clique problem, it does not run in polynomial time per maximal clique generated. However, it is efficient in a <b>worst-case</b> sense: by a result of , any n-vertex graph has at most 3n/3 maximal cliques, and the <b>worst-case</b> running time of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm (with a pivot strategy that minimizes the number of recursive calls made at each step) is O(3n/3), matching this bound.|$|E
25|$|Practical general sorting {{algorithms}} {{are almost}} always based on an algorithm with average time complexity (and generally <b>worst-case</b> complexity) O(n log n), of which the most common are heap sort, merge sort, and quicksort. Each has advantages and drawbacks, with the most significant being that simple implementation of merge sort uses O(n) additional space, and simple implementation of quicksort has O(n2) <b>worst-case</b> complexity. These problems can be solved or ameliorated {{at the cost of}} a more complex algorithm.|$|E

A total of NOK 451 million was invested, but was 'geared' by borrowing an additional amount corresponding to ten times the investment, so that - in reality - the municipalities were actually investing between NOK 4 and 5 billion. In a <b>worst-case</b> scenario the municipalities could lose NOK 900 million.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{operations}} required depends only {{on the number of}} levels the new element must rise to satisfy the heap property, thus the insertion operation has a <b>worst-case</b> time complexity of O(log n) but an average-case complexity of O(1).|$|E
25|$|This {{possibility}} {{has been}} confirmed in all the later studies, as the <b>worst-case</b> scenario. Other possibilities have also been raised such as micro-organisms that have harmful effects on crops, or that disrupt natural cycles, and pathogens that infect other micro-organisms.|$|E
