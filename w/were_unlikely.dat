5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E
5|$|Twin {{depth charge}} tunnels were {{built into the}} rear hull of the Mogador-class ships. Each tunnel housed eight Guirard depth charges, with another sixteen stowed in the rear magazine. They were {{launched}} by remote control in patterns of four using a chain system. Since no sonar equipment was fitted these depth charges <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to actually damage a submarine.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Goodbye, Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter in 1991, id Software planned to make a third set of episodes for the {{following}} December, titled Commander Keen in The Universe is Toast!. Beyond the proposed title and release date, shown in the epilogue of the two games, no design work was completed before the game was cancelled due {{to the success of}} id's Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as Doom (1993). John Carmack noted in 1999, when referencing the project that became the Game Boy Color game, that the original developers of Keen <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to ever work together again on another game.|$|E
5|$|British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{could be}} repaired within six months, and the Admiralty ordered further carrier-borne strikes against the battleship. First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham {{did not believe}} that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, but he hoped that further attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. The commander of the Home Fleet, Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser, initially resisted this order on the grounds that further carrier raids on Kaafjord <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be successful as Tirpitzs defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. Following an argument with Cunningham, Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again. Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord, many of the Home Fleet's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten. This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced than the men they replaced.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the members}} of the Long Parliament {{realised}} that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the Eastern Association), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to win the war. So Parliament initiated two actions. The Self-denying Ordinance, with the notable exception of Oliver Cromwell, forbade members of parliament from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent politics, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation {{for the creation of a}} Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General Thomas Fairfax, which became known as the New Model Army (originally new-modelled Army).|$|E
5|$|In April 1864, Beauregard {{saw little}} {{opportunity}} for military glory because he foresaw {{that there would}} be no more significant assaults against Charleston, and prospects for a major field command <b>were</b> <b>unlikely.</b> He requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic throat ailment, but he instead received an order to report to Weldon, North Carolina, near the Virginia border, to play a key role in the defense of Virginia. His new assignment, the Department of North Carolina and Cape Fear, also included Virginia south of the James River. When he took command on April 18, he renamed it, on his own initiative, the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. The Confederates were preparing for the spring offensive of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and were concerned that attacks south of Richmond could interrupt the critical supply lines to Richmond and the army of Robert E. Lee.|$|E
5|$|In Panama, it breeds year-round without {{apparent}} seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's Mamíferos de Venezuela (Mammals of Venezuela), reproductive {{activity is}} highest in June–July and December. In the laboratory, the gestation period is 28days; Linares reports {{that it is}} 20 to 30days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year {{and there are two}} to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, probably less than 50days old, were already pregnant. The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old; he estimated that animals <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to live {{for more than a year}} in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2.9months.|$|E

5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles {{did not yet}} exist however, and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed {{the idea of a}} caterpillar track for snow surfaces. In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to get him {{all the way to the}} Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck's XII Army, which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the Elbe River, <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to move further east. This {{assumption}} was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the link-up.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{birds are}} known to {{communicate}} using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage color of Anchiornis huxleyi, suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs. The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx, suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.|$|E

5|$|Ole Juulson Kvale was a Minnesota congressman of the Farmer-Labor Party, and a proud Norse-American. Kvale was {{a member}} of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to {{organize}} a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration voyage. This celebration was important to a Norse-American community that had been perceived as antiwar during World War I, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation. Kvale, a Lutheran minister, was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he was told that the Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar, seen by some as Protestant propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Prospects for a {{successful}} release did not look good. Aykroyd and Belushi had left SNL {{at the end of}} the previous season, reducing their bankability. Belushi's fame had taken a further hit after the commercial and critical failure of 1941 {{at the end of the}} year. One day after the editing was done, Wasserman invited Landis up to his office to speak with Ted Mann, head of the Mann Theatres chain, which dominated film exhibition in the Western United States. He told Landis that he would not book the film at any theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods, such as Westwood. Not only did Mann not want black patrons going there to see the film, he surmised that white viewers <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to see a film featuring older black musical stars. Ultimately The Blues Brothers got less than half the bookings nationwide for its initial release than a typical big-budget studio film of the era, which did not bode well for its success at the box office.|$|E
5|$|To remedy this, {{assorted}} {{odds and}} ends were used to reinforce 18th Army. The first of these was the only German cavalry division, aptly named 1st Kavalleriedivision. The mounted troops of this unit, accompanied by some infantry, were to occupy the weakly defended provinces east of the river IJssel {{and then try to}} cross the Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dike). A simultaneous landing in Holland near Enkhuizen was to be attempted, using barges to be captured in the small port of Stavoren. As both efforts <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to succeed, the mass of regular divisions was reinforced by the SS-Verfügungsdivision (including SS-Standarten Der Führer, Deutschland and Germania) and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, which would serve as assault infantry to breach the Dutch fortified positions. Still this added only 1 division to the equation.|$|E

5|$|Ælfgar's Irish confederate of 1055 is not {{identified}} in any source, {{and it is}} not clear that Diarmait had a part to play in the aforesaid events of that year. In fact, it is possible that Ælfgar received aid not from Diarmait, but from DonnchadDiarmait's enemy and Echmarcach's associatea man who then controlled the Norse-Gaelic enclaves of Limerick and possibly Waterford. Furthermore, although Diarmait appears to have gained overlordship of Mann by 1061, Echmarcach presumably enjoyed overlordship of at least part of the Hebrides in 1058. Since Magnús utilised Islesmen during his English campaign of that year, it is conceivable that Echmarcach may have played a prominent part in these operations. If Echmarcach was indeed involved in the campaign, the enmity between him and Diarmait could indicate that these two <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to have cooperated as allies.|$|E
5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, the Duke of York; William, the Duke of Clarence (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, the Duke of Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to have any further children. The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. The Duke of York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors <b>were</b> <b>unlikely</b> to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
