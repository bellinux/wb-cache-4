METHOD: Cross-sectional analyses of 848 community-dwelling men and women aged 75 - 90 living in Central Finland in 2012. Barriers to outdoor physical activity and unmet physical activity need were enquired with a questionnaire. The latent profiles were identified by profiling participants into latent groups using a mixture modeling technique on the multivariate set of indicators of outdoor physical activity barriers. A path model was used to study the associations of the profiles with unmet physical activity need. RESULTS: Five barrier profiles were identified. Profile A was characterized with minor barriers, profile B with <b>weather</b> <b>barriers,</b> profile C with health and <b>weather</b> <b>barriers,</b> profile D with barriers concerning insecurity, health and weather; and profile E with mobility and health barriers. The participants in the profiles differed {{in the proportion of}} individual and environmental barriers.

The construction failures ranged from minor to major failure of the structural integrity of the building. Some buildings became unhealthy to occupants. Most of these buildings are low-rise, 3-4 story buildings constructed of wood-frame construction, as well as some with steel, concrete, and metal stud construction types, including highrises.|$|E

40|$|This report {{addresses}} moisture {{safety in}} highly insulated wood-frame walls.  Research {{shows that the}} risk of moisture damages may increase with the thickness of the insulation layer. The possible consequences of increased insulation layers are reduced temperatures in the exterior part, more built-in moisture in the construction, reduced drying capacity and increased internal natural convection, which may lead to moisture damages. One of the major threats of elevated moisture levels in wood-frame constructions may be the risk of fungal growth, such as mould. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effect on the moisture conditions in highly insulated wood-frame walls, when using thermal insulating materials as a <b>weather</b> <b>barrier.</b> One of the main question of interest, is whether this solution will improve the moisture safety compared to using traditional types of weather barriers. In addition, there is a question of which materials may be suitable. The first part of the study is a literature search and is a study of existing literature and research on moisture issues related to highly insulated walls, weather barriers and external insulation. In addition, different products from manufacturers have been researched in order to find interesting products, mainly rigid foam, wood fibre and mineral wool products, to be used in the moisture simulation. A summary of the literatures search shows there may be a somewhat elevated risk of high moisture levels and mould growth in highly insulated walls compared to walls with less insulation. This negative effect of the insulation thickness on moisture levels can be influenced by many factors, such as the choice of materials, climate, moisture gains from the indoor air and air flow rate in the air gap. Laboratory investigations indicate that the choice of <b>weather</b> <b>barrier</b> may be of great importance for the moisture level in wall constructions. <b>Weather</b> <b>barrier</b> materials with higher thermal resistance and vapour permeability, may reduce the risk of moisture issues.   The second part of the thesis are the three parametric studies of hygrothermal simulations in WUFI. The calculations assess the use of exterior insulation as a measure to improve the moisture conditions in highly insulated wood-frame walls in a Norwegian climate. The wall construction in the parametric studies is limited to a common type of wood-frame wall. The influence of different insulating <b>weather</b> <b>barrier</b> products and the thickness of the material layers are the main parameters that are variated, in addition to different climates an initiation time of the calculations. The results from the simulations are used to evaluate the moisture conditions in highly insulated walls when using weather barriers of materials with high thermal resistance versus a traditional <b>weather</b> <b>barrier,</b> in addition to assessments of the moisture safety based on quantitative criteria for moisture damages, such as mould growth. The first study investigates the use of wood fibre boards as weather barriers. The results indicate that wood fibre boards may function well as <b>weather</b> <b>barrier,</b> and may even be more safe than conventional weather barriers. However, in the initial phases of the simulation periods, mould growth on an unacceptable level occurred. It may be desirable to achieve an acceptable level of growth in the initial stages. Therefore, the second study further investigates the use of wood fibre boards as weather barriers. In this study, most of the simulations starts in May, as opposed to in the first study, when the starting point is in January. This seems improve the results, as the mould growth is at an acceptable level in many simulation cases. The conventional <b>weather</b> <b>barrier</b> also has an improvement, but the RH levels in the dynamic cycles are still at a concerning level. The third study investigates the use of rigid foam boards used as weather barriers. When the simulations start in January, the product results in very high initial levels of mould growth and very high RH levels, which may result in condensation. Starting in May, the initial mould growth is somewhat reduced, but the risk of condensation seems to be eliminated. The product does however result in low RH values after the initial moisture dries when thicker boards are used...|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the use of façade {{integrated}} solar collectors in Norwegian buildings. One wall consisting of 0. 25 m of timber framed insulation, and one wall consisting of 0. 2 m insulation and 0. 2 m concrete were tested. The U-value of both walls were 0. 17 W/m 2 K. The solar collectors were mounted on these wall elements as a replacement of the external <b>weather</b> <b>barrier.</b> The investigations were conducted in TRNSYS and in a dynamic model describing the thermal performance of the façade integrated solar collectors, created at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The complete solar collector system was designed according to recommended values from literature. A parametric study looking at the optimal design of the storage tank set point temperature, the ratio between the tank height and the diameter, the regulatory strategy, the flow rate, the water tank volume and {{the placement of the}} heat exchanger were conducted. Following was a heat pump installed in series with the solar collectors in the existing system. Different maximum evaporator inlet temperatures were tested to find the optimal system design. The initial results showed that the heavy solar wall performed better than the lightweight solar wall. During the winter days, the heavy solar wall lead to a substantial reduction in the negative transmission compared to the conventional heavy wall. During the summer days, both of the solar walls introduced a positive transmission contribution, which may lead to overheating the building. The contribution was lowest for the heavy solar wall. When installing 6. 68 m 2 collector area in the TEK- 10 building with the heavy wall configuration, the annual negative transmission was reduced by 84 % through the wall area with the installed collectors. A positive transmission of 39 kWh annually was also introduced. The parametric study revealed that the best design for system performance was not necessarily the optimal design for transmission energy savings. Related to transmission, lowering the flow rate showed the highest energy saving, of 1. 5 kWh/m 2 annually. In maximizing the collector performance, changing the regulatory strategy of the system led to an annual energy saving of 1. 05 kWh/m 2 floor area. This was also the efficiency measure that led to the biggest energy saving when accounting for both transmission and collector performance. The use of a series connected heat pump further improved the system performance. A maximum evaporator inlet temperature of 15 °C led to the highest energy saving of 30 % compared to the system without the heat pump, when accounting for both transmission and collector performance...|$|E

50|$|Once {{moisture}} has penetrated {{deep into}} a wall system through the <b>weather</b> resistant <b>barrier</b> and into the exterior sheathing, the wall is deep wet.

40|$|Moisture and {{subsequent}} mold problems in buildings are {{a serious and}} increasing concern for the building industry. Moisture intrusion in buildings is especially pertinent in hot and humid climates because the climate conditions provide only limited drying potential {{while at the same}} time providing a high potential for mold growth. To reduce moisture accumulation in wall systems, it is important to design wall systems that not only reduce moisture intrusion, but also allow drying. Yet often a wall's ability to dry is not considered during the design or material selection process. No cladding system or installation is perfect, therefore wall systems should be designed with the assumption that some moisture will enter and then consider the effects and how that moisture can be managed. This paper explores the mechanisms of wall drying, focusing on how wood frame walls dry in hot, humid climates. This paper describes laboratory drying studies of conventional sheathing / <b>weather</b> resistive <b>barrier</b> systems under a variety of temperature and humidity conditions including those typical of hot humid climates. Additionally, a computer simulation is used to examine the implications of drying to the interior, drying to the exterior, or drying to both the interior and exterior. Traditional rules of thumb for construction in hot humid climates rely on drying to the interior, but we will show that walls can and do dry to the exterior in these climates...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis aimed (1) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the existing test methods used in characterizing moisture performance of <b>weather</b> resistive <b>barrier</b> (WRB) products, and (2) to provide a benchmark for assessment of different boundary conditions. The test materials were placed between a layer of water and various types of hygroscopic sinks including vacuum cast gypsum, oriented strand board (OSB), thick adsorbing paper (blotter) and a desiccant (anhydrous calcium chloride). The WRB were either placed directly in contact with the hygroscopic sink or were separated from it by an air gap. These tests indicated that moisture transport was highly dependent on the conditions introduced on the upper and the lower surfaces of the WRB. This thesis reports the results of a series of experimental studies, which examined moisture transport to characterize WRB for input into material standards. The new test methods developed in the thesis include: modified inverted cup (MIC) test for measuring the maximum possible total moisture transmission, moisture flux (MF) test for measuring moisture flow to an OSB or plywood substrate, and liquid penetration resistance (LPR) test for measuring onset and the rate of the liquid phase transport. The test methods were used to examine moisture transport through new WRB. The test were also used to evaluate effect of penetrations, outdoor weathering, and contribution of detergent dissolved in the interstitial water. Subsequent to the material testing, an assembly testing provided a comparative evaluation of such effects as penetrations or additives in a stucco layer. Proposed in this thesis are new laboratory test methods and the acceptance criteria to be incorporated in the next edition of North American material standards. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
