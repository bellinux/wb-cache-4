5000|$|In November 2002 Justice Govind {{said that}} there is nothing revolutionary in {{offering}} discounts in sentencing to criminals <b>who</b> <b>plead</b> <b>guilty.</b> Justice Kishore Govind made headlines when he told lawyers that there could be up to 25 percent discount in sentencing if their clients <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty.</b> He says guilty pleas have been attracting lesser sentences already but he thought he would spell it out and make it generally known. Justice Govind {{said that there}} are a number of reasons why he thought the discounting was a good move.“It saves a complainant or a victim in cases like violence or rape the trauma of going to trial to giving evidence. Secondly, it saves the state a lot of expense, calling witnesses, wastage of court time. So there are a lot of pluses attendant upon a plea of guilty and I think any person <b>who</b> <b>pleads</b> <b>guilty</b> should be rewarded for it." ...|$|R

25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court can appeal against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person <b>who</b> <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an accused person. The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the grounds of appeal do not involve any question of law, the conviction is supportable by the evidence, and {{there is nothing in the}} circumstances of the case which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Kemp, Bennett, Kirkpatrick and {{financial}} backer Theodore Forstmann co-founded {{the free market}} advocacy group Empower America, which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works. [...] Empower America represented the populist wing of the party: while avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and gay rights, it promoted free markets and growth over balancing the budget and cutting the deficit. He resigned as Co-Chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) questioned his ties to Samir Vincent, a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil-for-food scandal <b>who</b> <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to four criminal charges, including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. Testimony about Kemp became prominent in the trial. Also, FBI informant Richard Fino tied Kemp to James Cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election.|$|E
500|$|Several scandals {{took place}} during the Kirchner administration. The first {{involved}} the detention of Venezuelan-American businessman Antonini Wilson in an airport after being found with a suitcase filled with $800,000. This money was illegally provided by Petróleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, to be used for Kirchner's 2007 general election campaign. Details of the case were explained by businessman Carlos Kauffmann and lawyer Moisés Maiónica, <b>who</b> <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty.</b> The FPV financing of the 2007 elections caused another scandal years later. Three pharmaceutical businessmen, Sebastián Forza, Damián Ferrón, and Leopoldo Bina, were found dead in 2008, a case known as the [...] "Triple Crime". Further investigation of Forza, who contributed $200,000 to the campaign, identified him as a provider of ephedrine to the Sinaloa Cartel. In 2015, Martín Lanatta and José Luis Salerno, convicted for the killings, claimed that Aníbal Fernández was the boss of a mafia ring that ordered those killings to secure the illegal traffic of ephedrine. Fernández denied the charges, maintaining that it was a set up to undermine his chances in the 2015 general election. General illegal drug trade grew in Argentina during Kirchnerism, and saw Mexican and Colombian syndicates working with Peruvian and Bolivian smugglers. Conviction rates for money laundering were almost nonexistent. Mariano Federici, head of the Financial Information Unit, said that the [...] "magnitude of the threat is very serious, and this would never have been possible without collaboration from government officials in this country".|$|E
