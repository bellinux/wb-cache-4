50|$|Single node systems use a {{comparable}} mechanism called a watchdog timer. A watchdog timer will reset the node if the node {{does not tell}} the <b>watchdog</b> <b>circuit</b> that it is operating well. A STONITH decision can be based on various decisions which can be customer specific plugins.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{applications}} of stepping motor in industrial controlling fields, an intelligent control {{system is designed}} based on personal computer and single chip machine in this paper. The working principle and control mode of stepping motor are introduced firstly. Then, the hardware of single chip machine system is introduced; especially the crystal oscillator circuit, driving circuit, power circuit, LED display circuit, <b>watchdog</b> <b>circuit</b> and serial communication circuit are analyzed in details. Finally the software including motor controlling program, communication program and human-machine interface program are designed. The practice showed that the system has the characters of good performance and low cost, {{so it can be}} widely used in stepping motor controlling...|$|E
40|$|The NCV 8881 {{consists}} of a Buck switching regulator (SMPS) with a combination SMPS output undervoltage monitor and CPU <b>watchdog</b> <b>circuit.</b> In addition, two fixed−voltage low dropout regulator outputs are provided, and share an LDO output voltage status output. Once enabled, regulator operation continues until the Watchdog signal is no longer present. The NCV 8881 is intended for Automotive, battery−connected applications that must withstand a 40 V load dump. The switching regulator is capable of converting the typical 9 V to 19 V automotive input voltage range to outputs from 3. 3 V to 8 V at a constant switching frequency, which can be resistor programmed or synchronized to an external clock signal. Enable input threshold and hysteresis are programmable, with the enable input state replicated at an open drain Ignition Buffer output. The regulators are protected by current limiting, input overvoltage and overtemperature shutdown, a...|$|E

50|$|A smaller {{version of}} the RL78/G13 was {{introduced}} in 2012, the RL78/G12. Introduced with 20, 24, and 30-pin packages with 2 KB to 16 KB small size flash memory although providing the G13 functionality with integrated +/- 1% 24 MHz oscillator, reset circuit, a low voltage detection <b>circuit,</b> <b>watchdog</b> timer, data flash with background operation, and including functional safety, on-chip with A/D converter testing function.|$|R
50|$|A {{watchdog}} timer is an electronic timer that detects abnormal operation of other components and initiates corrective action to restore normal operation. It especially ensures that microcontroller controlled devices do not completely fail if a software error or momentary hardware error occurs. Watchdog timers are typically based on either a monostable timer or digital counter. The timer circuit may be integrated on the microcontroller chip or be implemented as an external <b>circuit.</b> <b>Watchdog</b> timers can significantly improve {{the reliability of}} a microcontroller in an electromagnetically-influenced environment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the demand}} of power department, a {{protection}} & monitoring device {{for the power}} distribution line is studied. The device using DSP as the core technology is a new industrial control unit, which adopts the of dual CPU of DSP+DSP and consists of chip selection unit, A/D conversion, data storage, <b>watchdog</b> <b>circuit,</b> press key, switch quantity detection, control output, communication, display and clock etc. The software system includes two parts: tracking software and protection software. The device ensures the high reliability and feasibility, at same time incarnates the advantage of microprocessor protection by intelligent designs. Instruction Relay protection device is widely used in the power system secondary equipment. With {{the development of the}} power distribution automation and the increasing of the degree of power system automation, great changes has taken place in the structure and run mode of power system. Users take many new demands on the conventional protection device, and the same time, the power system has put forward higher requirements to the performance of the protection device, which brings new topics and higher requirements. In the paper, we offer a new design scheme about microprocessor protection device...|$|E
50|$|JP Moodabe {{was almost}} the exact {{opposite}} of his brother: shorter still, slim and conservative, he was the financial <b>watchdog</b> for the <b>circuit,</b> perfectly balancing MJ's sometimes extravagant personality. There is no record of their ever fighting openly over a point of business, although after a disagreement JP would simply not show up at the office for a day or two. As brothers they loved each other deeply; as businessmen they respected and carried out each other's decisions. In the 1960s JP made an emotional visit to Brazil to meet one of his sisters for the first time.|$|R
