5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} <b>were</b> <b>even</b> more prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} the {{abundance}} of invertebrates crawling around on land and near water, in moist soil and wet litter, offered a food supply. Some <b>were</b> <b>even</b> big enough to eat small tetrapods, but the land was free from dangers common in the water.|$|E
5|$|Dwarfism was {{not seen}} as a defect in ancient Egypt, unlike in many other cultures. Egyptian texts advised the {{acceptance}} of those with physical or mental disabilities, and there <b>were</b> <b>even</b> two dwarf gods, Bes and Ptah.|$|E

5|$|The tunnels {{were built}} {{by more than}} 300,000 local citizens, {{including}} school students, on volunteer duties. Some portions <b>were</b> <b>even</b> dug {{without the help of}} any heavy machinery. Centuries-old city walls, towers and gates, including the old city gates of Xizhimen, Fuchengmen, and Chongwenmen were destroyed to supply construction materials for the complex.|$|E
5|$|A demo of The Age of Kings was {{released}} on October 16, 1999. It featured the learning campaign, a sample of a random map game, {{and the ability to}} play via the MSN Gaming Zone. Much to Ensemble Studios' disappointment, numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked. These were picked up by warez sites, and sold illegally throughout the Pacific Rim; warez versions of the game <b>were</b> <b>even</b> sold outside Microsoft's offices in South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations <b>were</b> <b>even</b> more {{cramped and}} poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists {{passed through the}} crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5000|$|A number (i.e., integer) {{expressed}} in the decimal numeral system <b>is</b> <b>even</b> or odd according to whether its last digit <b>is</b> <b>even</b> or odd.That <b>is,</b> if the last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, then it is odd; otherwise it <b>is</b> <b>even.</b> The same idea will work using any even base.In particular, a number {{expressed in}} the binary numeral system is odd if its last digit <b>is</b> 1 and <b>even</b> if its last digit is 0.In an odd base, the number <b>is</b> <b>even</b> according to {{the sum of its}} digits [...] - [...] it <b>is</b> <b>even</b> if and only if the sum of its digits <b>is</b> <b>even.</b>|$|R
25|$|Recall {{that the}} square of an <b>even</b> number <b>is</b> <b>even</b> and {{the square of}} an odd number is odd. So if {{the square of the}} {{hypotenuse}} <b>is</b> <b>even</b> the hypotenuse <b>is</b> <b>even</b> as well.|$|R

5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What to the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There <b>were</b> <b>even</b> some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there <b>were</b> <b>even</b> records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus <b>were</b> <b>even</b> more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties <b>were</b> <b>even</b> with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century Middle English {{was fully}} developed, {{integrating}} both Norse and Norman features; {{it continued to}} be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits <b>were</b> <b>even</b> used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they <b>were</b> <b>even</b> used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; the diseases crippled armies and decimated populations before battles <b>were</b> <b>even</b> fought. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E

5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} the version better known today. In that version, transposed to D major, the laudes interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including {{these in the}} tutti movements.

5|$|Hofstra {{played at}} fifth-seeded Cornell, where the teams <b>were</b> <b>even</b> at halftime, 5–5.

5|$|Important {{factors for}} the {{germination}} of spores are mainly moisture and temperature. The spores usually remain germinable after several years; there <b>were</b> <b>even</b> spores preserved in herbarium specimens which germinated after 75 years. After the spores' development, they first receive a diploid nucleus, and the meiosis {{takes place in}} the spore. At the germination, the spore shells open either alongside special germinal pores or chinks, or rip irregularly and then release one to four haploid protoplasts.|$|E
