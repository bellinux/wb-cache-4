40|$|Background: Health {{hazards of}} tobacco {{are well known}} but only small numbers of tobacco users are {{fully aware of the}} harmful effects of tobacco. <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> on tobacco {{products}} are an effective way of communicating the consequences of tobacco use and bring about behavioural changes like quitting and reducing the tobacco consumption. So the present study was conducted to investigate the awareness and effectiveness of warning labels on tobacco products among health and non-healthcare professional of Barwala, Panchkula. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was carried out among 408 subjects who were randomly selected from different professional colleges of Barwala, Panchkula. Data obtained were anlysed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square test using SPSS 20. 0. Results: Most of study participants has noticed the warnings on tobacco products and most of them believe that they could understand warning labels. More that 70 % believe that warnings create awareness about health hazards of tobacco and help in reducing or quitting tobacco. Pictorial warning was found to be better as compared to text warning. Health professionals were able to assess pictorial warnings more correctly as compared to non-healthcare professionals. Conclusion: <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> on tobacco packs effectively inform people about adverse health effects of tobacco but the mandated warnings do not serve the desired purpose since they are not properly understood...|$|R

40|$|Background: Since 1989 when {{health warning}} labels {{appeared}} on Canadian cigarette packages, the labels have changed from text only covering {{less than one}} quarter of the package to text and graphics covering over half the package. This study examines how Canadians in their 20 s feel about the current graphic warning labels and their potential to prevent smoking and encourage quitting. Methods: Participants between 20 and 24 years of age were part of a 10 -year cohort study begun when the group was in Grade 6, with the purpose of examining factors that may affect smoking. Five questions about warning labels were added to the 2002 questionnaire requesting information on perceptions of the labels and their potential impact on smoking behaviours of young adults. One item had been included in previous questionnaires. Results: 32. 8 % (n= 1267) of the respondents were smokers, with males (35. 6 %) being more likely to smoke than females (30. 4 %). Current smokers were less likely than experimental/ex-smokers to believe that warning labels with stronger messages would make people their age less likely to smoke. Female current smokers were more likely to think about quitting. Conclusion: Despite the efforts taken in developing the labels, some young adults are skeptical about their effects. <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> may have to be modified to target issues that are relevant to young adults; gender differences are important in this modification. <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> can offer an additional component to a comprehensive tobacco control program, in that they provide health information.

40|$|<b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> on {{cigarette}} packages rely on {{the negative}} health aspects of smoking. For smokers, however, smoking is related to positive {{as well as to}} negative outcomes. Positive smoking outcomes are shown to be crucial in activating smoking behaviour. Thus, this study compared current health warnings with warning labels contradicting positive outcomes. In a field study, 39 adult smokers were followed over a 5 -day period to investigate the effect of the different types of warning labels on actual smoking behaviour. Our results provide evidence that smokers, who received warning labels contradicting positive outcome expectancies, smoked less than smokers, who received current health warnings. Thus, contradicting positive smoking outcomes on cigarette warning labels may be an effective tool in smoking prevention and intervention...|$|R

40|$|Mothers {{are widely}} {{considered}} to bear special responsibilities {{for the health}} of their children. <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> directed at pregnant women on containers of alcohol or cartons of cigarettes are indicative of social expectations regarding maternal responsibilities to provide their future children with the healthiest prenatal environment. Beyond pregnancy, as Rebecca Kukla has argued: mothers bear a disproportionate responsibility for managing their children’s contact with professional health institutions, maintaining their health at the domestic level (through feeding and hygiene practices and the like), and training them in safety and self-care. Correspondingly, mothers are held disproportionately responsible for their children’s physical and mental health imperfections [1].

40|$|Abstract Background Use {{of energy}} drinks has {{significantly}} increased in recent times. Besides athletes, teenagers {{and students are}} among the most common consumers. However, popularity is also increasing among the younger and older age groups. Most of the users believe that they are a good source of instant energy and are unaware of its high Caffeine content resulting in harmful effects on health. Case presentation We report the case of a young boy who presented with palpitations and high blood pressure as a result of energy drinks usage. He had been consuming a “Sting” energy drink on regular basis while studying for long hours during his O’ level Exams. His medical examination revealed Sinus tachycardia and high blood pressure. Rest of the examination and lab workup was within normal limits. His pulse and blood pressure returned to normal range after discontinuing Sting usage.

40|$|<b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> on violent {{television}} programs give viewers discretionary advice and, therefore, might arouse reactance in viewers of all ages. Information labels give view-ers information but no advice and, therefore, should not arouse reactance. Five age groups were tested: 9 - 11 year olds, 12 - 14 year olds, 15 - 17 years olds, 18 - 20 year olds, and adults at least 21 years old. Participants (N 5900) read descriptions of violent and nonviolent TV programs and rated {{how much they}} wanted to watch them. The description contained a warning label, an information label, or no label. Consistent with reactance theory, results showed that warning labels drew {{people of all ages}} to violent TV programs.

40|$|The {{review article}} by Vally and Misso (1) {{published}} in the current edition of this journal outlines {{the broad range of}} signs and symptoms associated with sulphite sensitivity. These include bronchoconstriction, wheezing, dyspnea, nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhoea, urticaria/angiodema, diaphoresis, hives, laryngeal oedema, generalised itching and swelling, tingling sensations, flushing, hypotension, cyanosis, shock and loss of consciousness (2). Many of the symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis. Indeed reactions to sulphites can be life threatening, as a number of fatal cases have been reported (3, 4). In many areas of the world, sulphites are now one of the potential allergens (along with the likes of peanuts, fish, crustaceans, gluten and milk) that have to be labelled on food and drink products. In the European Union (EU), levels in foods and drinks above 10 mg/kg or 10 mg per litre have to be <b>labelled.</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> are now commonplace, yet in practice there is still a huge amount of ignorance and misinformation about the use of sulphites in food, drinks and pharmaceutical products.

40|$|Signal words, such as DANGER, WARNING, and CAUTION {{are often}} used on {{consumer}} products to connote various levels of hazard. Each of these signal words is usually printed in a color (e. g., white on a dark background) in order to potentially increase saliency or aesthetics. Hence, there is a potentially significant interaction of signal word, color, and product type on perceived hazard. <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> for muriatic acid, Xtra-Clean All Purpose Cleaner, and Crayola Crayons were factorially combined with signal word (DEADLY, DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, and NOTE) and color of signal word (orange, blue, red, black) {{for a total of}} 60 conditions. A sample of 124 undergraduates rated each product warning on understandability, likelihood of compliance, carehlness, and attention-gettingness. Results indicated that muriatic acid had significantly higher hazard ratings than either the cleaner or crayons. Black connoted the highest level of hazard followed by blue, red, and orange. Furthermore, the order of perceived hazard from highest to lowest for signal word was DEADLY, DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, and NOTE. Moreover, there appears to be an averaging effect in which muriatic acid with the signal word NOTE printed in orange produced the same connoted hazard level as the package of crayons with the signal word CAUTION printed in red.

This study aimed to improve our knowledge of the policy-relevant context of waterpipe smoking among six countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and the United Arab Emirates. Participants were young adult university students (18 - 29 years) from both genders who had ever smoked the waterpipe, recruited from universities participating in this study. Directed content analysis was used to analyze the transcripts. Results: A total of 53 in-depth interviews were conducted in Arabic in 2016. Findings were organized around 5 themes: waterpipe product characteristics; patterns of waterpipe smoking; the waterpipe café setting; perceived health consequences; and health warning labels.

50|$|On 19 December 2012 the European Commission adopted its {{proposal}} {{to revise the}} European Union Tobacco Products Directive 2001/37/EC which included proposals to introduce restrictions on the use and sales of e-cigarettes.On 8 October 2013 the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted down the Commission's {{proposal to}} introduce medical regulation for e-cigarettes, but proposed that cross-border marketing of e-cigarettes be regulated similarly to tobacco products, meaning that sales of e-cigarettes to under-18s would be prohibited in the European Union, along with most cross-border advertising. <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> also would be required. The Parliament and Member States are involved in trilogue discussions to reach a common conclusion. In February 2014, the European Parliament approved new regulations for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The new regulations forbid advertising of e-cigarettes, set limits on maximum concentrations of nicotine in liquids, limit maximum volumes of liquid that can be sold, require child-proof and tamper-proof packaging of liquid, set requirements on purity of ingredients, require that the devices deliver consistent doses of vapor, require disclosure of ingredients and nicotine content, and empower regulators to act if the regulations are violated.

40|$|Objectives Smokers {{might think}} that the {{negative}} effects of smoking can be compensated for by other behaviours, such as doing exercise or eating healthily. This phenomenon is known as compensatory health beliefs (CHBs). Graphic warning labels on cigarette packets emphasize {{the negative effects of}} smoking, which may impact CHBs. Research so far has assessed CHBs explicitly only via questionnaires, although implicit cognition might be an important factor in continuing to smoke. This study investigated the impact of graphic warning labels on CHBs, by testing CHBs both implicitly and explicitly. Design The study had a three-group experimental design. ANOVAs and multiple regression analyses were run on the results. Methods We assessed explicit CHBs among non-smokers, smokers, and smokers confronted with graphic warning labels (N = 107; 47 females, 23. 89 years old, 78 daily smokers). Implicit associations between smoking and CHB-specific behaviours (e. g., eating healthy food) were measured using a Single-Target Implicit Association Test. After the experiment, participants were able to choose between a healthy and unhealthy food reward. Results Non-smokers and smokers differed in explicit CHBs but not in implicit cognitions. <b>Warning</b> <b>labels</b> influenced implicit associations among smokers but did not affect explicit CHBs. Most interestingly, implicit associations and explicit CHBs predicted food choice and smoking among smokers not confronted with warning labels. Conclusions Graphic warning labels could be used in interventions to inhibit automatic associations between smoking and healthy behaviours. Unlearning implicit cognitions might in turn affect explicit CHBs, thus decreasing their role in reducing the negative feelings caused by smoking...|$|R
