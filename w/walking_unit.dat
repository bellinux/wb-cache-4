50|$|Vampires {{can create}} new vampires with their bite, but {{generally}} prefer not to. Given {{the existence of}} vampire couples with vampire children, they seem able to reproduce sexually. Ankh-Morpork resident Arthur Winkins became a vampire {{as part of an}} inheritance that included an old castle in Überwald and the accompanying noble title. His wife Doreen Winkins refers to herself as a vampiress, or vampire by marriage, although she is not actually undead. However, in Reaper Man, Doreen was not affected by the hypnotic music playing throughout the city (which turned normal people into mindless <b>walking</b> <b>units)</b> - a characteristic shared by the other undead she was with.|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} {{oxygen consumption}} during <b>walking</b> per <b>unit</b> distance (Cw) values for 12 human healthy young males at six speeds from 0. 667 to 1. 639  m s− 1 (four min per stage) {{on a level}} gradient under normobaric normoxia, moderate hypoxia (15 % O 2), and severe hypoxia (11 % O 2). Muscle deoxygenation (HHb) was measured at the vastus lateralis muscle using near-infrared spectroscopy. Economical speed which can minimize the Cw in each individual was calculated from a U-shaped relationship. We found a significantly slower economical speed (ES) under severe hypoxia [1. 237 (0. 056) m s− 1; mean (s. d.) ] compared to normoxia [1. 334 (0. 070) m s− 1] and moderate hypoxia [1. 314 (0. 070) m s− 1, P 0. 05). HHb gradually increased with increasing speed under severe hypoxia, while it did not increase under normoxia and moderate hypoxia. Changes in HHb between standing baseline and the final minute at faster gait speeds {{were significantly related to}} individual ES (r= 0. 393 at 1. 250  m s− 1, r= 0. 376 at 1. 444  m s− 1, and r= 0. 409 at 1. 639  m s− 1, P< 0. 05, respectively). These results suggested that acute severe hypoxia slowed ES by ∼ 8 %, but moderate hypoxia left ES unchanged...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: Oxygen {{consumption}} during <b>walking</b> per <b>unit</b> distance (Cw; mL/kg/m) {{is known}} to be greater for older adults than younger adults, although its underlying process is controversial. Methods: We measured the Cw values at six gait speeds from 30  m/min to 105  m/min on level ground and gradient slopes (± 5 %) in healthy younger and older male adults. A quadratic approximation was applied for a relationship between Cw and gait speeds (v; m/min). It gives a U-shaped Cw–v relationship, which includes a particular gait speed minimizing the Cw, the so-called economical speed (ES). The age-related difference of the Cw–v relationship was assessed by comparisons of ES and/or Cw. Results: A significantly greater Cw at 30  m/min and slower ES were found for older adults at the downhill gradient, suggesting that a combination of leftward and upward shifts of the Cw–v relationship was found at that gradient. Only a slower ES was found for older adults at the uphill gradient, suggesting that a leftward shift was found for older adults at that gradient. Neither a significant leftward nor an upward shift was found at the level gradient. Leg length significantly correlated to the ES for younger adults at the level and downhill gradients, while such a significant relationship was observed only at the level gradient for older adults. The maximal quadriceps muscle strength significantly correlated to the ES for older adults at all gradients, but not for younger adults. Conclusion: The age-related alteration of the Cw–v relationship depends on the gradient, and its related factors were different between age groups...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} data on behavior {{associated with the}} redesign of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The unit was designed {{to reduce the amount}} of time staff spent walking, so they could focus on activities supporting infants and their families. Access to natural light and windows were also provided in response to research indicating that exposure to natural light and views impacts health outcomes. Staff behavior was examined utilizing predesign research (PDR) and post-occupancy eva-luation (POE) techniques. Researchers gathered 124 hours of predesign and postconstruction beha-vioral mapping data, distributed questionnaires and conducted interviews. The hypothesis that walking would be reduced in the new design was not sup-ported, although when the data were weighted to reflect the impact of the size of the large unit, the ratio of time spent <b>walking</b> to total <b>unit</b> area was found to be less in the open plan.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the increase in walking economy (i. e., decrease in net metabolic rate per kilogram) after weight loss in obese adolescents is induced by a lower metabolic rate required to support the lower body weight and maintain balance during walking. METHODS: Sixteen obese adolescent boys and girls were tested before and after a weight reduction program. Body composition and oxygen uptake while standing and walking at four preset speeds (0. 75, 1, 1. 25, and 1. 5 m·s⁻¹) and at the preferred speed were quantified. Net metabolic rate and gross metabolic cost of walking-versus-speed relationships were determined. A three-compartment model was used to distinguish the respective parts of the metabolic rate associated with standing (compartment 1), maintaining balance and supporting body weight during walking (compartment 2), and muscle contractions required to move the center of mass and limbs (compartment 3). RESULTS: Standing metabolic rate per kilogram (compartment 1) significantly increased after weight loss, whereas net metabolic rate per kilogram during walking decreased by 9 % on average across speeds. Consequently, the gross metabolic cost of <b>walking</b> per <b>unit</b> of distance-versus-speed relationship and hence preferred walking speeds did not change with weight loss. Compartment 2 of the model was significantly lower after weight loss, whereas compartment 3 did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The model showed that the improvement in walking economy after weight loss in obese adolescents was likely related to the lower metabolic rate of the isometric muscular contractions required to support the lower body weight and maintain balance during walking. Contrastingly, the part of the total metabolic rate associated with muscle contractions required to move the center of mass and limbs {{did not seem to be}} related to the improvement in walking economy in weight-reduced individuals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} that tested the feasibility and efficacy of using injectable microstimulators (BIONs ®) in a functional electrical stimulation (FES) device to correct foot drop. Compared with surface stimulation of the common peroneal nerve, stimulation with BIONs provides more selective activation of specific muscles. For example, stimulation of the tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles with BIONs produces ankle flexion without excessive inversion or eversion of the foot (i. e., balanced flexion). Efficacy was assessed using a 3 -dimensional motion analysis of the ankle and foot trajectories during walking with and without stimulation. Without stimulation, the toe on the affected leg drags across the ground. BION stimulation of the TA muscle and deep peroneal nerve (which innervates TA and EDL) elevates the foot such that the toe clears the ground by 3 cm, which {{is equivalent to the}} toe clearance in the less affected leg. The physiological cost index (PCI) measured effort during walking. The PCI equals the change in heart rate (from rest to activity) divided by the <b>walking</b> speed; <b>units</b> are beats per metre. The PCI is high without stimulation (2. 29 ± 0. 37, mean ± SD) and greatly reduced with surface (1. 29 ± 0. 10) and BIONic stimulation (1. 46 ± 0. 24). Also, walking speed increased from 9. 4 ± 0. 4 m/min without stimulation to 19. 6 ± 2. 0 m/min with surface and 17. 8 ± 0. 7 m/min with BIONic stimulation. These results suggest that FES delivered by a BION is an alternative to surface stimulation and provides selective control of muscle activation.

40|$|Eurasian lynx are {{individually}} identifiable {{by their}} unique coat markings, making them ideal candidates for capture–recapture (CMR) surveys. We evaluated {{the use of}} digital photography to estimate Eurasian lynx population abundance and density within the Bavarian Forest National Park. From November 2008 to January 2009 we placed 24 camera trap sites, each with two cameras facing each other on well–used <b>walking</b> tracks). The <b>units</b> were placed based on a systematic grid of 2. 7 km. We captured five independent and three juvenile lynx and calculated abundance estimates using Program Mark. We also compared density estimates based on the MMDM method (Mean Maximum Distance Moved) from telemetry data (½MMDMGPS) and from camera trapping data (½MMDMCAM). We estimated that in an effectively sampled area of 664 km 2 the Eurasian lynx density was 0. 9 individuals/ 100 km 2 with ½MMDMCAM. The Eurasian lynx density calculated with ½MMDMGPS was 0. 4 individuals/ 100 km 2 in an effectively sampled area of 1, 381 km 2. Our results suggest that long–term photographic CMR sampling {{on a large scale}} may be a useful tool to monitor population trends of Eurasian lynx in accordance with the Fauna–Flora–Habitat Directive of the European Union...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} {{if there is}} variation {{in the frequency of}} tree species maintained at household level, and the socioeconomic factors that can explain its variation. Data were collected from 156 randomly selected households in 2009 in Ambober village of Gondar district, Ethiopia. Farm visits and recording, observation, group discussion and interview were the methods used to collect the data. Data were analyzed using mean, independent samples test, one way analysis of variance, and multiple regression techniques. The results showed that there was significant variation in tree species abundance with fast growing tree species like Ecucalyptus camaldulensis being the most common. The ordinary least square estimation results indicated that family size, income, and household’s head age contributed positively towards household level tree species abundance. While farm size, tropical livestock <b>unit,</b> <b>walking</b> distance affected the variation in tree species abundance negatively, sex of household head, location dummy, land tenure and years of land ownership turned out to be insignificant. On the other hand, tropical livestock unit, family size, income, household’s head age, tenure insecurity, and walking distance positively affected household level tree species composition.

40|$|Animals {{initiate}} behavior {{not only}} reflexively but also spontaneously {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. In vertebrates, electrophysiological data on the neuronal activity associated with the self-initiated voluntary behavior have accumulated extensively. In invertebrates, however, {{little is known about the}} neuronal basis of the spontaneous initiation of behavior. We investigated the spike activity of brain neurons at the time of spontaneous initiation of walking in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii and found neuronal signals indicative of readiness or preparatory activities in the vertebrate brain that precede the onset of voluntary actions. Those readiness discharge neurons became active > 1 s before the initiation of walking regardless of stepping direction. They remained inactive at the onset of mechanical stimulus-evoked walking in which other descending units were recruited. These results suggest that the parallel descending mechanisms from the brain separately subserve the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked walking. Electrical stimulation of these different classes of neurons caused different types of walking. In addition, we found other descending units that represented different aspects of <b>walking,</b> including those <b>units</b> that showed a sustained activity increase throughout the walking bout depending on its stepping direction, as well as one veto unit for canceling out the output effect of the readiness discharge and three termination units for stopping the walking behavior. These findings suggest that the descending activities are modularized in parallel for spontaneous initiation, continuation, and termination of walking, constituting a sequentially hierarchical control...|$|R
40|$|The {{study used}} data {{collected}} through household surveys. Data were analysed through OLS. Socioeconomic factors that govern tree species abundance and compostion were identified.

40|$|Hip fractures, {{the most}} serious osteoporosis-related fractures, mainly affect older people. The {{functional}} outcome for many hip fracture patients remains to be improved. Hip fractures in young patients are uncommon, but lifelong disability may prevail. The aim of this thesis was to examine possibly modifiable factors correlated with functional outcome in older subjects with hip fracture. Furthermore, to study background data and trauma mechanism in young and middle-aged patients with femoral neck fracture. Finally, the frequency of osteoporosis and sarcopenia in younger patients with a hip fracture was examined. Study I A total of 850 patients with hip fractures were included. Outcomes including return to independent living, pressure ulcer (PU), length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality {{were considered in relation}} to time between admission and surgery. Patients operated upon later than 36 and 48 hours after admission were less likely to return to independent living while {{there was no significant difference}} when using the 24 -hour cut-off limit. The incidence of PU and LOS in the groups operated on later was increased at all 3 cut-off limits. The mortality rate did not differ. Study II A total of 246 patients with femoral neck fracture and cognitive impairment were included. All were able to walk before the fracture. Significant predictors of preserved walking ability and ADL function at 4 - and 12 -month follow-up were: discharge to rehabilitation <b>unit,</b> <b>walking</b> ability, and ADL function prior to fracture, whereas surgical method was not. Patients discharged to rehabilitation unit were less likely to be wheelchair bound at any follow-up occasion. Study III Included were 27 young (20 - 49 years of age) and 158 middle-aged (50 - 69 years of age) patients with a femoral neck fracture. They were studied regarding trauma mechanisms and risk factors for osteoporosis and hip fracture. A minority of both the young and middle age group had a high-energy trauma as a cause for the hip fracture. Life style factors and other non-trauma related risk factors appeared to be main contributors to the occurrence of the hip fracture in both age groups Study IV The study population was the same as in Study III. Bone mineral density (BMD) and fat-free mass (FFM) were determined by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). FFM index (FFMI) was calculated as the ratio of FFM (kg) and height squared. One third of the study population had FFMI below the 10 th percentile of a of an ageand gender-matched reference population, i. e. indicating sarcopenia. All young patients had a femoral neck BMD below the mean for age and 90 % of the middle-aged patients had osteopenia (56 %) or osteoporosis (34 %). In conclusion, the result of this thesis indicates that early operation of patients with hip fracture improves the ability to return to independent living, reduces the incidence of pressure ulcers and reduces the length of hospital stay. Discharge to rehabilitation unit, a factor we can influence, and previous function were both associated with preserved walking ability and ADL function in cognitively impaired patients with hip fracture. A minority, both in the young and middle-aged patients had a high-energy trauma as a cause for the hip fracture. And most of these patients have one or more risk factors for hip fracture and low BMD regardless of the trauma mechanism. One third has signs of sarcopenia i. e. low muscle mass...|$|R
