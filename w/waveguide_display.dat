40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Aims. By {{focusing on}} the oscillations of the cross-sectional area and the total intensity of magnetic waveguides located in the lower solar atmosphere, we aim to detect and identify magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sausage waves. Methods. Capturing several high-resolution time series of mangetic waveguides and employing a wavelet analysis, in conjunction with empirical mode decomposition (EMD), makes the MHD wave analysis possible. For this paper, two sunspots and one pore (with a light bridge) were chosen as representative examples of MHD waveguides in the lower solar atmosphere. Results. The <b>waveguides</b> <b>display</b> a range of periods from 4 to 65 minutes. These structures display in-phase behaviour between the area and intensity, presenting mounting evidence for sausage modes within these waveguides. The detected periods point towards standing oscillations. Conclusions. The presence of fast and slow MHD sausage waves has been detected in three different magnetic waveguides in the solar photosphere. Furthermore, these oscillations are potentially standing harmonics supported in the waveguides which are sandwiched vertically between the temperature minimum in the lower solar atmosphere and the transition region. The relevance of standing harmonic oscillations is that their exploitation by means of solar magneto-seismology may allow insight into the sub-resolution structure of photospheric MHD waveguides...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} optical {{transmission}} of a waveguide that is side coupled to a high-Q circular microresonator. The coupling is critical if the intrinsic resonator losses equal the coupling losses to the waveguide. When this happens, the transmittance of the <b>waveguide</b> <b>displays</b> resonance dips with maximal depth as the frequency is {{swept through the}} resonators' resonances. We show that multiple configurations, parametrized by the minimal distance between the resonator and the waveguide, can lead to critical coupling. Indeed, for a sufficiently large resonator radius, the flow of power between the waveguide and the resonator can change sign several times within a single pass. This leads to an oscillatory coupling parameter {{as a function of}} the separation distance. As a result, multiple geometrical configurations can lead to critical coupling, even if the waveguide lies in the equatorial plane of the resonator. These results are explained using coupled-mode theory and full-wave numerical simulations. In the vicinity of secondary or higher-order critical coupling, the depth of the transmittance dip is very sensitive to the environment. We discuss how this effect can be exploited for sensing purpose. Alternatively, by actively controlling the environment in the secondary critical configuration, the waveguide-resonator system can be driven as an optical switch.

Phononic crystals are periodic structures that prohibit {{the propagation of}} elastic waves through destructive interference and exhibit large band gaps and ballistic propagation of elastic waves in the permitted frequency ranges. In contrast, random-structured materials do not exhibit band gaps and favour localization or diffusive propagation. Here, we use structures with correlated disorder constructed from the so-called stealthy hyperuniform disordered point patterns, which can smoothly vary from completely random to periodic (full order) by adjusting a single parameter. Such amorphous-like structures exhibit large band gaps (comparable to the periodic ones), both ballistic-like and diffusive propagation of elastic waves, {{and a large number}} of localized modes near the band edges.

This study leads to a design methodology that facilitates the reali-zation through systematic design of long-range modes in any asymmetric hybrid plasmonic waveguide (AHPW). Examining the modal behavior of an AHPW reveals that field symmetry {{on either side of}} the metal is the only necessary condition for plasmonic structures to support long-range propagation. We report that this field sym-metry condition can be satisfied irrespective of asymmetry in a waveguide structure, material, or even field profile.

40|$|Waves, of {{wavelength}} λ, transmit poorly through apertures of dimensions ℓ≪λ. Here it {{is shown}} that coupling of a subwavelength aperture to an electromagnetic oscillator {{makes it possible}} for a focused, diffraction-limited beam that impinges on the aperture to undergo perfect transmission. Ignoring nonradiative losses, and for apertures with closed boundaries in a metallic screen, the transmitted power at the oscillator’s natural frequency is enhanced by a factor of (λ/ℓ) ^{ 6 } compared with the nonresonant case. As a nontrivial extension to apertures with open boundaries, an analytically solvable problem is introduced and analyzed, which involves a pair of arbitrarily small slits in a two-dimensional <b>waveguide.</b> The system <b>displays</b> perfect transmission at a frequency corresponding to that of a quasilocalized, cavitylike mode bound to the slits, the frequency of which is below that of the cutoff mode of the continuum.

40|$|Structural {{changes of}} electroactive species during {{electrochemical}} reactions cannot be determined from the electroanalytical technique alone. By incorporating spectroscopic techniques with electrochemistry, {{additional information about}} analyte structure and composition of the double layer can be obtained during electrochemical processes. Several spectroscopic methodologies have been tailored for this purpose including electronic and vibrational spectroscopies. Mid-infrared ATR spectroscopy is especially interesting as it provides in-situ information about adsorbates at the electrode surface. Mass transport limitations present in mid-infrared (mid-IR) external reflection and transmission spectroelectrochemistry are circumvented with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroelectrochemistry. However, limitations of appropriate electrode materials for internal reflection configurations have hindered widespread adoption of the technique. The work described in this thesis focuses on the development and coupling of electrically conducting DLC films with mid-IR transparent multi-reflection waveguides for ATR spectroelectrochemistry. Conducting diamondlike carbon (DLC) thin films were developed utilizing pulsed laser deposition systems in collaboration with Joanneum Research (Leoben, Austria) and at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill). Nitrogen doping and incorporation of noble metal nanoclusters were investigated as approaches aimed at improving the electrical conductivity of DLC. Detailed compositional studies of nitrogen-doped DLC layers showed that sp 2 -hybridized carbon {{is responsible for the}} observed electrochemical activity. Optical transparency of thin (~ 40 nm) DLC layers in the mid-IR regime was confirmed by transmission-absorption measurements upon deposition on zinc selenide ATR waveguides. Additionally, the first spectroelectrochemical application of conducting DLC films was demonstrated via the electropolymerization of polyaniline onto coated ATR elements. Metal-DLC nanocomposite layers were investigated with various analytical techniques obtaining detailed compositional information. Improved electrochemical activity of metal-DLC demonstrated their suitability as electrode materials. Sufficient mid-IR transmissivity of metal-DLC coated germanium <b>waveguides</b> was <b>displayed</b> to enable spectroelectrochemical application. Finally, electropolymerization of poly(4 -vinylpyridine) in acetonitrile was pursued to produce highly cross-linked ion-exchange membranes for spectroelectrochemical sensing. The composition of the pre-polymerization mixture and deposition conditions were tailored to obtain uniform semipermeable membranes. Diffusion of cations to electrodes is restricted by performing the electropolymerization as established herein. By employing the described electropolymerization procedure at DLC-coated waveguides, spectroelectrochemical sensing strategies can now be extended into the mid-IR regime. Ph. D.

40|$|Strongly {{localised}} plasmons in metallic nano-structures offer exciting characteristics for guiding {{and focusing}} {{light on the}} nano-scale, opening {{the way for the}} development of new types of sensors, circuitry and improved resolution of optical microscopy. The work presented in this thesis focuses on two major areas of plasmonics research - nano-focusing structures and nano-sized waveguides. Nano-focusing structures focus light to an area smaller than the wavelength and will find applications in sensing, efficiently coupling light to nano-scale devices, as well as improving the resolution of near field microscopy. In the past the majority of nano-focusing structures have been nano-scale cones or tips, which are capable of focusing light to a spot of nano-scale area whilst enhancing the light field. The alternatives are triangular nano-focusing structures which have received far less attention, and only one type of triangular nano-focusing structure is known – a sharp V-groove in a metal substrate. This structure focuses light to a strip of nano-scale width, which may lead to new applications in microscopy and sensing. The difficulty with implementing the V-groove is that the structure is not robust and is quite difficult to fabricate. This thesis aims to develop new triangular nano-focusing devices which will overcome these difficulties, whilst still producing an intense light source on the nano-scale. The two proposed structures presented in this thesis are a metallic wedge submerged in uniform dielectric and a tapered metal film lying on a dielectric substrate, the latter being the easier to fabricate and the more structurally sound and robust. The investigation is performed using the approximation of continuous electrodynamics, the geometrical optics approximation and the zero-plane method. The second aim of this thesis is to investigate plasmonic waveguides and couplers for the development of nano-optical circuitry, more compact photonic devices and sensors. The research will attempt to fill the gaps in the current knowledge of the V-groove waveguide, which consists of a sharp triangular groove in a metal substrate, and the gap plasmon waveguide, which consists of a rectangular slot in a thin metal film. The majority of this work will be performed using the author’s in house finite-difference time-domain algorithm and FEMLAB as well as the effective medium method and geometric optics approximation. The V-groove may be used as either a nano-focusing or waveguiding device. As a waveguide the V-groove {{is one of the most}} promising plasmonic waveguides in the optical regime. However, there exist quite a number of gaps in the current knowledge of V-groove waveguides which this thesis will attempt to fill. In particular, the effect of rounded groove tip on plasmon propagation has been assessed for the V-groove. The investigation of rounded groove tip is important, as due to modern fabrication processes it’s not possibly to produce an infinitely sharp groove, and the existing literature has not considered the impact of this problem. The thesis will also investigate the impacts of the inclusion of dielectric filling in the groove on plasmon propagation parameters. This research will be important for optimising the propagation characteristics of the mode for certain applications, but it may also lead to easier methods of fabricating the V-groove device and prevent oxidation of the metal film. The gap plasmon waveguide is easier to fabricate than the V-groove, and is a new type of sub-wavelength <b>waveguide</b> which <b>displays</b> many advantages over other types of plasmon waveguides, including ease of fabrication, almost 100 % transmission around sharp bends, sub-wavelength localisation and long propagation distances of the guided mode, etc. This waveguide may prove invaluable in the development of compact photonic devices. In the past the modes supported by this structure were not thoroughly analysed and the possibility of using this structure to develop sub-wavelength couplers for sensing and nano-optical circuits was not considered in detail. This thesis aims to resolve these issues. In conclusion, the results of this thesis will lead to a better understanding of Vgroove and gap plasmon waveguide devices for the development of nano-optical circuits, compact photonic devices and sensors. This thesis also proposes two new nano-focusing structures which are easier to fabricate than the V-groove structure and will lead to applications in sensing, coupling light efficiently into nano-scale devices and improving the resolution of near-field microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technologies of wireless communications systems {{have led to}} an increasing desire for several antennas performing diverse functions at different frequencies to be integrated into a common radiating aperture. This {{gives rise to the}} so-called multifunction antenna, which affords the saving of scarce premium real estate and can alleviate problems arising from excessive antenna protrusions in aspects such as aerodynamics, aesthetics, and stealth capability in military applications. Where rapid and simultaneous operations are required, electronically phased-steered array antennas using waveguide elements offer an effective and viable solution. This is in virtue of the excellent isolation which waveguides can provide when operated below the fundamental modal cutoff. Miniaturized waveguide elements are thus needed for realizing multi-frequency interlaced arrays. Although to entirely fill waveguides with dielectric material to realize compact waveguides is feasible, the increased attenuation losses and weight may cause problems. An alternative approach is the partially-filled sidewall loaded rectangular waveguide. The advantages of this waveguide include having lower dielectric losses and being lighter than its entirely filled counterpart. These advantages, however, are still trivial. The prominent property which this alternative waveguide possess is that when operated at the so-called TEM frequency, the fundamental mode of this structure displays TEM plane wave properties, i. e. uniform aperture field distribution over the empty region with clean linear polarization, and exhibiting a modal propagation constant that is equal to that of a uniform plane wave in freespace. Therefore, these are called quasi-TEM hard waveguides. Intuitively, these attributes may provide good radiation performance when the waveguides are terminated as open-ended radiating elemental apertures of a planar array antenna. However, they may be advantageous only for broadside array scan and when the radiating aperture entirely fills the unit cell. The latter aspect is certainly violated in interlaced arrays requiring miniaturized waveguide elements. It is then a primary objective of this thesis to investigate the complete and true effects of the TEM modal plane wave property of the hard waveguide elements on the array performance. Results have shown that, even when operated at the TEM condition under broadside array scan, miniaturized apertures of the quasi-TEM hard waveguides lead to poor array transmission. Nevertheless, miniaturization in E-plane is found to be more facilitated than in H-plane. The performance at the TEM condition is optimal for a particular aperture size, this being a crucial finding. When an internal homogeneous dielectric layer is incorporated into each waveguide element to serve as a matching section, very good array transmission can be obtained even for highly miniaturized apertures under a specific set of operating conditions, e. g. matched for broadside array scan and at the TEM frequency. However, the matching is narrowband. Nonetheless, this provides good isolation from other frequencies and allows closely separated bands to be operated simultaneously. Moreover, the matching is fairly well maintained even when the array is scanned off broadside in both principal E and H planes. It is also learnt that the bandwidth of the matching degrades more rapidly when the aperture is miniaturized in H-plane than in E-plane. Although the waveguide elements of the array operating at the lower frequency band are unable to interfere with those of the higher frequency bands, the converse is not true. This may be solved if the waveguides of the lower frequency band have, in addition to a usual lower cutoff frequency, an upper one as well. Novel waveguides with such a feature can be realized by loading the internal walls with metamaterials. This thesis has studied one such structure comprising an array of metallic strip dipoles imprinted on the surfaces of the two dielectric sidewall loadings of a rectangular waveguide. This structure serves as a <b>waveguide</b> filter, <b>displaying</b> a passband within which the lower frequency band can be operated, and an upper stopband in which the higher frequency band may reside. The thesis concludes with a final investigation on the prospect of using an array of open-ended waveguide apertures as a focal plane array feed for reflector antennas. The goal {{of the study was to}} ascertain the effects of mutual coupling on radiation efficiency. Although an active uniformly illuminated and linearly phase steered array only has reflection losses but no coupled losses, an array feed whose aperture is synthesized to match the focal plane fields of a reflector antenna has both reflection and coupled losses. Hence, although a desired feed radiation pattern may be synthesized to achieve high feed efficiency, the radiation efficiency has often been neglected. This work elucidates the importance of the latter aspect...|$|R
