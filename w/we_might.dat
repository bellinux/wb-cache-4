5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until we {{get some sort of}} third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} imagine that if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to – today <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern conservatism.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe liquid {{water and energy}} are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting to find another place where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have liquid water. But, energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|This day a {{dense fog}} {{obscured}} everything. Things a foot away {{could not be}} made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. The frightening waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up into the blue sky and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|E
25|$|Sir Jack is {{the only}} cricketer of whom <b>we</b> <b>might</b> fairly say that he {{directly}} descended from W.G. armed, like Jove.|$|E

60|$|Even the dullest {{among us}} {{understood}} that <b>we</b> three <b>might</b> be {{absent from the}} settlement many days, and yet our preparations for the dangerous journey were most simple.|$|R
25|$|This {{implies that}} in the Gödel lambdadust solution, the {{absolute}} future of each event has a character {{very different from what}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> naively expect.|$|E
25|$|Note {{also that}} the {{population}} from which the sample is drawn {{may not be the}} same as the population about which we actually want information. Often there is large but not complete overlap between these two groups due to frame issues etc. (see below). Sometimes they may be entirely separate – for instance, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> study rats {{in order to get a}} better understanding of human health, or <b>we</b> <b>might</b> study records from people born in 2008 in order to make predictions about people born in 2009.|$|E
25|$|From the Holocaust, we must {{remember}} the depths to which humanity might sink; but then we {{must remember}}, as well, the heights to which <b>we</b> <b>might</b> aspire.|$|E

30|$|Another {{weakness}} of our surveillance is the short study {{period and the}} low number of VAP and CLABSI cases, and the high sensitivity and negative predicted values <b>we</b> measured <b>might</b> be due to this limitation [17].|$|R

25|$|He gave us passions—if we {{may call}} them passions—in order that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> seek after those things which we need, and {{which we had}} a right to {{experience}} and know.|$|E

25|$|Colburn wrote prolifically and well; all {{his contemporaries}} {{attest to the}} way he added insight and opinion to {{straight}} reporting. His books and articles were the stuff of technology transfer in his day. He was certainly the first engineering journalist, as <b>we</b> <b>might</b> understand the term today.|$|E
25|$|This {{will be a}} long {{fight and}} anti-capitalism may fail. Nevertheless, at the very worst, even in failure <b>we</b> <b>might</b> succeed in bearing witness to the {{pathological}} absurdities of a world where money makes human beings and the rest of nature a means rather than an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Providence knew best," [...] she answered. [...] "IT {{gave you}} moustaches. That {{was in order}} that <b>we</b> women <b>might</b> be spared from always seeing you as you are. Besides, I said 'Nine times out of ten.' There are exceptions--SUCH exceptions!" ...|$|R

25|$|Hogan has {{emphasised}} that {{it would}} be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning.

25|$|It is {{no secret}} {{that there have been}} some {{difficult}} episodes in our past – Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. But history cannot be rewritten, however much <b>we</b> <b>might</b> sometimes wish otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn from the sadness and build on the gladness.|$|E
25|$|But if in {{addition}} to interchanging {{the names of the}} values we also interchange the names of the two binary operations, now there is no trace of what we have done.

60|$|And sweet {{with young}} Lycoris to recline In some Illyrian valley far away, Where canopied on herbs amaracine <b>We</b> too <b>might</b> waste the summer-tranced day Matching our reeds in {{sportive}} rivalry, While far beneath us frets the troubled purple of the sea.|$|R
