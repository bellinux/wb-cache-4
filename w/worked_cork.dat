40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{and sustainable}} materials {{can be used}} as a template to create biomimetic/biomorphic ceramics, known as Ecoceramics (environmentally conscious ceramics). In this <b>work,</b> <b>cork</b> was chosen as template to produce novel ceria (CeO 2) ecoceramics, for applications in water splitting for H 2 production via direct concentrated solar thermochemical fuel production (TCFP). The cork powder was pyrolised at 900 °C and the resulting carbon skeleton was infiltrated with an aqueous CeO 2 precursor, and then heated at 1000 °C for 2 h to produce the ecoceramic. The cellular structure of the cork was maintained, with hexagonal cell dimensions of 20 - 30 μm in diameter, but the grains were nanoscale at ≤ 100 nm. XRD data confirmed that CeO 2 was the only crystalline phase obtained. An important feature was that, while the rectangular side walls were maintained to hold the three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3 DOM) cellular cork structure, the rear hexagonal walls were pierced repeatedly through the structure, unlike in the original cork structure, which will allow gasses such as H 2 to permeate well into the structure, greatly increasing the reactive area available for catalysis. The next step will be to test the capabilities of both the regular, porous 3 DOM structure and the nanoscale grains for thermochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen under direct concentrated solar energy...|$|R
5000|$|In O'Flanagan and Buttimer's <b>work,</b> <b>Cork</b> History and Society they {{single out}} the insular peninsular world of Schull-Kilcrohane-Beara as showing {{a pattern of}} densely {{populated}} clustered settlements with population densities of South East Asian proportions. This was possible due to complex partnership arrangements in the organisation of land use and work rhythms {{and the use of}} the spade for cultivation due to a surplus of labour. Joint farming was integral and marine resources of seaweed and marine coral sand was extensively used. In Dunmanus Bay this came from Carbery Island among other places. Seasonal migration to the better farmlands of East Cork and Munster also added to income. In South Kilkenny, Amhloaimh O Suilleabhain (Humphrey O'Sullivan) said that a [...] "spailpina bochta" [...] could earn 8d. a day and the sickle men [...] "lucht corain [...] "15d. Added to this widespread sub-division, early marriages, the availability of wasteland, smallpox inoculation and the presence of a cottier textile industry and the contribution of fishing allowed a massive population expansion. Land was let by the 'gneeve' i.e. the grass of one cow or one twelfth of a ploughland. The contribution of the wife by keeping poultry and spinning was important. Between 1766 and 1821 the number of households in the Durrus area increased by 60/69%, the population rose significantly.|$|R
40|$|Cork-polymer {{composites}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising fields of cork technology to create materials for a sustainable development. In this <b>work,</b> <b>cork</b> particles and powder were compounded with polypropylene (PP) by twin-screw extrusion and further processed by injection or compression moulding. The obtained PP/Cork injection moulded composites were used to investigate the tensile properties before and after water absorption (WA) tests. The addition of polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and stearic acid was evaluated. The composites show good distribution and dispersion of cork with interesting aesthetic characteristics. Low cork content (5 wt. %) reinforces the stiffness of the PP. The addition of PP-g-MA up to 8 wt. % promotes an increase on the tensile strength while the stearic acid contributes only with a slight increase on the tensile strain. The thermo-physical properties were investigated and the composites present lowWA. In general the tensile properties of the composites were not significantly affected after theWAtests. Moreover, theWAwas found to increase with an increase in cork content and was reduced with the PP-g-MA and stearic acid. It was also found, that cork act as nucleating agent and promotes antioxidant protection to PP. Both properties ameliorate with the increase of the cork content. Low cork content improves the thermal resistance while increasing the bio-based component increases the composite density and the thermal conductivity. The maximum incorporation of cork on the PP matrix through extrusion process was 93 % in volume...|$|R

40|$|Cork is {{the bark}} of Quercus suber tree. This bark has an amazing number of {{possible}} uses, particularly {{for the production of}} cork stoppers. Metals in cork can come from different sources; it could be from the field or the different industrial process that the cork suffers before the transformation to the final product [1]. There are different types of corks such as natural cork that is a 100 % natural product, agglomerated stoppers which can be manufactured by individual moulding or extrusion, and in both methods, the agglutinated substance used to connect the cork granules is approved for the use in food contact materials. These stoppers are entirely made from granulated cork from sub-products from the production of natural cork. In the present <b>work,</b> <b>cork</b> samples from different steps of the industry process were analysed. The following chemical elements were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) : Vanadium (V), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Selenium (Se), Lead (Pb), Cobalt (Co), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn) and Strontium (Sr). The method for sample preparation of cork stoppers consisted on grinding and homogenizing samples, followed by an acid-assisted microwave digestion to destroy the organic matrix. For quality control purposes parameters such as repeatability, linearity of the calibration curve, blanks or recovery of spiked samples were monitored and complied with the acceptance criteria established by the laboratory. Several elements were present in the samples in amounts above the quantification limits (ppb or ppt level). However, and according to European legislation [2], the total amount of the elements found was always below the maximum limit. We may conclude that there’s no contamination of the chemical elements during the manufacturing process of agglomerated cork stoppers...|$|R

25|$|The Honan Chapel is internationally {{regarded}} as representing the best artwork of the Irish Arts & Crafts Movement (1894–1925). However, socially, {{the commission was}} also significant because the project generated much needed <b>work</b> in <b>Cork</b> during the First World War (1914–18). The project fostered the revival of silver and textile craft working, once central to the Cork economy, and supported local firms, through patronage, such as the builders John Sisk & Son. Today Sisk is a construction firm of national importance. Egan’s of Patrick Street continued making liturgical altar plate and textiles until it ceased trading in 1986. As a central figure behind the Honan commission, Rev. Sir John Robert O’Connell was a catalyst in Irish cultural life {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century. His collaboration with Sir Bertram Windle between 1914-17 greatly assisted the physical expansion of University College Cork and the revival of craft industry in Cork.|$|R
50|$|With {{the closure}} of the Gunpowder Mills in the early 1900s, Ballincollig became little more than a small village on the road from Cork city to the larger market town of Macroom.

Other Regiments stationed in the Barracks before it was decommissioned were 1st Field Artillery Regiment and 8th Field Artillery Regiment (FCÁ). The recently decommissioned Murphy Barracks was a major source of employment. In the 1970s, Ballincollig developed as much more of a satellite town, with many housing developments constructed around the old village, and housing people who <b>worked</b> in <b>Cork</b> city or its suburbs. This expansion continued through the late 80s and 90s. Consequently, the town's population has risen dramatically, particularly with the westward expansion of the town.
