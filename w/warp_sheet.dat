40|$|The {{solar and}} interplanetary {{magnetic}} sector structure has its source in a large-scale photospheric magnetic field structure that is carried {{away from the}} sun by the solar wind to form a <b>warped</b> equatorial current <b>sheet</b> in the heliosphere; this current sheet makes one complete rotation past the earth in the solar rotation period of 27 days.

Sun-weather analyses are described, where the time at which the <b>warped</b> current <b>sheet</b> is observed to be carried past the earth by the solar wind gives the phase information. Individual troughs crossing 180 deg longitude when the IMF is directed away from the sun are significantly larger than troughs crossing 180 deg longitude when the field is toward the sun.

They proposed that the disconnections are a natural combination of Alfven's model and the solar-wind sector structure first discovered by Wilcox and Ness (1965). The DEs can be utilized as probes of interplanetary sector structure. Correlations between DEs and sector boundaries observed at earth are considered, and sector boundary properties deduced from DEs are discussed.

40|$|Warped astrophysical discs {{are usually}} treated as laminar viscous flows, which have {{anomalous}} properties when the disc is nearly Keplerian and the viscosity is small: fast horizontal shearing motions and large torques are generated, which cause the warp to evolve rapidly, {{in some cases}} {{at a rate that}} is inversely proportional to the viscosity. However, these flows are often subject to a linear hydrodynamic instability, which may produce small-scale turbulence and modify the large-scale dynamics of the disc. We use a <b>warped</b> shearing <b>sheet</b> to compute the oscillatory laminar flows in a warped disc and to analyse their linear stability by the Floquet method. We find widespread hydrodynamic instability deriving from the parametric resonance of inertial waves.

The massif exhibits a conspicuous layered structure which consists of layers of dunite, lherzolite, plagioclase lherzolite, and {{a small amount of}} gabbro and pyroxenite. Coexisting minerals from all the rock types of the layered ultramafic to mafic sequence were analysed by EPMA. The ferromagnesian minerals show large compositional variations in accordance with lithological change in the series of dunite â†’ lherzolite â†’ plagioclase lherzolite â†’ gabbro. Forsterite content of olivine varies successively from Fo 92. 5 to Fo 64. 5. Enstatite content of orthopyroxene also varies from En 93. 0 to En 85. 5. Large and continuous compositional variation was also obtained for clinopyroxenes, e. g. Ca 46 Mg 51 Fe 3 from dunite, Ca 48 Mg 48 Fe 4 from lherzolite, Ca 49 Mg 46 Fe 5 from plagioclase lherzolite, Ca 50 Mg 44 Fe 6 from the margin of gabbro, and Ca 38 Mg 39 Fe 23 from the center of gabbro. Al and Ti contents of clinopyroxcncs and pargasitic amphiboles increase with decrease of the Mg/ Mg + Fe ratio. The mineralogical characteristics indicate that the Horoman layered sequence represents a magmatic series formed by fractional crystallization. The gabbroic seams in the plagioclase lherzolite and the layers of gabbro were probably formed by crystallization of residual liquid which were slightly alkaline in chemical nature. The Horoman ultramafic rocks are strongly modified by deep-seated deformation and recrystallization, and additionally by mylonitization during the up-thrusting intrusion into the Earth's crust. The primary composition of minerals, obtained by step-scanning EPMA analyses are recognized as a distinct and uniform compositional plateaus at the cores of large, porphyroclastic, primary grains. The equilibration temperatures were calculated for the orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene pairs of primary porphyroclasts, using the Opx-Cpx geothermometer.

The graphitization of hexagonal SiC surfaces provides a viable alternative for the synthesis of graphene, with wafer-size epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) now possible. Despite this recent progress, the exact nature of the graphene-SiC interface and whether the graphene even has a semiconducting gap remain controversial. Using scanning tunneling microscopy with functionalized tips and density functional theory calculations, here we show that the interface is a <b>warped</b> carbon <b>sheet</b> consisting of three-fold hexagon-pentagon-heptagon complexes periodically inserted into the honeycomb lattice. These defects relieve the strain between the graphene layer and the SiC substrate, while still retaining the three-fold coordination for each carbon atom. Moreover, these defects break the six-fold symmetry of the honeycomb, thereby naturally inducing a gap: the calculated band structure of the interface is semiconducting and there are two localized states near K below the Fermi level, explaining the photoemission and carbon core-level data. Nonlinear dispersion and a 33 meV gap are found at the Dirac point for the next layer of graphene, providing insights into the debate over the origin of the gap in epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001).

40|$|Astrophysical discs are warped {{whenever}} a misalignment {{is present in}} the system, or when a flat disc is made unstable by external forces. The evolution of the shape and mass distribution of a warped disc is driven not only by external influences but also by an internal torque, which transports angular momentum through the disc. This torque depends on internal flows driven by the oscillating pressure gradient associated with the warp, and on physical processes operating on smaller scales, which may include instability and turbulence. We introduce a local model for the detailed study of warped discs. Starting from the shearing sheet of Goldreich & Lynden-Bell, we impose the oscillating geometry of the orbital plane by means of a coordinate transformation. This <b>warped</b> shearing <b>sheet</b> (or box) is suitable for analytical and computational treatments of fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, etc., and {{it can be used to}} compute the internal torque that drives the large-scale evolution of the disc. The simplest hydrodynamic states in the local model are horizontally uniform laminar flows that oscillate at the orbital frequency. These correspond to the nonlinear solutions for warped discs found in previous work by Ogilvie, and we present an alternative derivation and generalization of that theory. In a companion paper we show that these laminar flows are often linearly unstable, especially if the disc is nearly Keplerian and of low viscosity. The local model can be used in future work to determine the nonlinear outcome of the hydrodynamic instability of warped discs, and its interaction with others such as the magnetorotational instability.

Starting from the National Solar Observatory photospheric magnetograms, the position of the neutral line at the source surface () is determined using the potential field source surface model. A plasma sheet is centered around the current sheet represented as the radial extension of the neutral line. Comparing the synoptic maps of the streamer belt obtained with the SOHO/LASCO-C 2 coronagraph and the simulated synoptic maps constructed from our model of the <b>warped</b> plasma <b>sheet,</b> we confirm earlier findings by Wang et al. (1997, ApJ, 485, 875; Wang et al. 2000, Geophys. Res. Lett., 27, 149) that the streamers are associated with folds in the plasma sheet. Although the large-scale structure of the streamer belt is described reasonably well, some features, however, cannot be explained in this framework. We propose that two types of large-scale structures take part in the formation of these additional features. The first one is an additional fold of the neutral line, which does not appear in the modeled source surface neutral line, but is well visible in photospheric magnetograms. The second one is a plasma sheet with a ramification {{in the form of a}} secondary short plasma sheet. We show that these structures better describe the observed configurations of the streamer belt. The secondary plasma sheet can be formed between two secondary current sheets connected to the main current sheet.

The maps are based on 16 years of 5 -min averages of Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) 8 magnetic field data. During this time, IMP 8 traversed the tail between - 25 R(sub E) and - 40 R(sub E) in the x direction. Its average x distance was - 33 R(sub E). For this average distance we show separate maps for low and high dipole tilts, corresponding to equinox and northern hemisphere summer seasons. The low-tilt (equinox) maps show symmetrical field and current patterns; the high-tilt (solstice) maps show the cross-tail current sheet arcing above the equatorial diagonal {{in the center and}} dipping below it on the flanks. The shape of <b>warped</b> current <b>sheet</b> fits Fairfield's (1980) displaced ellipse model fairly well. The distance at which the current sheet is hinged to the magnetic equator is found to be 9. 88 R(sub E) and is independent of Kp.

A Harris sheet profile with a 7 R(sub E) thickness fits the B(sub x) profile. Though these are magnetic field data, the JxB maps clearly outline the plasma sheet. This approach also gives 7 R(sub E) thickness.

The model matches the MHD solution for a simple dipole test case better than earlier source surface and current sheet models. The strength and polarity of the radial interplanetary magnetic field component predicted for quiet time samples in each year from 1977 to 1986 agree with observations made near the Earth's orbit better than the hybrid MHD-source surface model (Wang and Sheeley, 1988). The results raise the question of whether coronal holes are the only solar source of the interplantary magnetic field in the solar wind. If some interplanetary flux originates outside coronal holes, the model can match the observed field using the accepted 1. 8 saturation correction factor for lambda 5250 A magnetograph observations. Requiring open flux to come exclusively from coronal holes requires and additional factor of two...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaser cutting {{has started}} {{to be used as}} an {{effective}} method for cutting out blanks from rolled sheet metals because of its high flexibility for cutting line and high productivity. However, residual stresses, which are generated by laser cutting, have been the greatest obstacle for the popularization of laser cutting. One of the problems is the warp which appears in the sheet metal, after being subjected to bending processes after laser cutting. The authors present a light indentation method for reducing residual stress generated by laser cutting. The method is to give light indentation on the sheet metal edge and to reduce tensile residual stress generated near the laser cutting surface. In particular, this present paper especially focuses upon optimization of working condition depending on mechanical properties of blank. Furthermore, the mechanism of transition of stress and effective strain in light indentation was examined. Experiments of U-bending after applying light indentation were conducted for usability of this method. The FEM analyses were carried out in order to investigate the effect of working condition in various mechanical properties. As a result, the optimum condition of light indentation method in various materials was found out, and the <b>warp</b> of bent <b>sheet</b> metals was drastically reduced...|$|R
40|$|In {{the outer}} heliosphere, beyond {{the solar wind}} {{termination}} shock, {{it is expected that}} the <b>warped</b> heliospheric current <b>sheet</b> forms a region of closely-packed, multiple, thin current sheets. Such a system may be subject to the ion-kinetic tearing instability, and hence generate magnetic islands and hot populations of ions associated with magnetic reconnection. Reconnection processes in this environment have important implications for local particle transport, and for particle acceleration at reconnection sites and in turbulence. We study this complex environment by means of three-dimensional hybrid simulations over long time scales, in order to capture the evolution from linear growth of the tearing instability to a fully developed turbulent state at late times. The final state develops from the highly ordered initial state via both forward and inverse cascades. Component and spectral anisotropy in the magnetic fluctuations is present when a guide field is included. The inclusion of a population of new-born interstellar pickup protons does not strongly affect these results. Finally, we conclude that reconnection between multiple current sheets can act as an important source of turbulence in the outer heliosphere, with implications for energetic particle acceleration and propagation.

40|$|Rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, are plausibly {{the source}} of power behind many astrophysical systems, such as gamma-ray bursts, {{supernova}}e, pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. In the past several years, 3 D numerical simulations {{made it possible to}} compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first principles and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than aligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique pulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3 D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to the standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away from the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is the primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To demonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and orthogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3 D description of the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the <b>warped</b> magnetospheric current <b>sheet</b> and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties outside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet separates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each other. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven, rather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across the current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a mechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical description of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar gamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse gamma-ray bursts and supernovae.
