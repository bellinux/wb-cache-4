Counterfeit clothes, shoes, jewelry and handbags from designer brands are made in varying quality; sometimes the intent is only to fool the gullible buyer who only looks at the label and {{does not know what}} the real thing looks like, while others put some serious effort into mimicking fashion details. Others realize that most consumers do not care if the goods they buy are counterfeit and just wish to purchase inexpensive products. The popularity of designer jeans in 1978, spurred a flood of knockoffs. Factories that manufacture counterfeit designer brand garments and watches are usually located in developing countries, with between 85-95% of all counterfeit goods coming from China. International tourists visiting Beijing, China, may find a wide selection of counterfeit designer brand garments at the Silk Street. Expensive watches are vulnerable to counterfeiting as well. In Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, authentic looking but poor quality watch fakes with self-winding mechanisms and fully <b>working</b> <b>movements</b> can sell for as little as US $20 to good quality ones that sell for $100 and over. Also some fakes' movements and materials are of remarkably passable quality [...] - [...] albeit inconsistently so [...] - [...] and may look good and work well for some years, a possible consequence of increasing competition within the counterfeiting community. Some counterfeiters have began to manufacture their goods in the same factory as the authentic goods. Yuandan goods is a term used to describe those fakes that are produced in the same factory as legitimate designer pieces without authorized permission to do so. These goods are made from scraps and leftover materials from the genuine products, produced illegally and sold on the black market.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a possible}} method {{to increase the}} coupling tractive force track-wheel locomotion of construction machines. Sufficient tractive coupling force allows organizing translational displacement of the machine under above-medium load modes during operation of overburden chain excavators, tower cranes and gantry cranes in outdoors environments. A mechanism is examined to convert rotary motion into rectilinear motion using {{the example of a}} gear and rail, with kinematic calculations quoted. Analysis of the “force couple” system is proposed to identify free traction forces. Factors are established that influence the machine’s <b>working</b> <b>movements.</b> Equations to calculate tractive forces in track-wheel locomotion are described. A laboratory complex is presented where students of mechanical engineering gain practical skills in mastering the production process of soil excavation and the influence of the coupling tractive force during the machine’s operation. As practical recommendation, the paper describes a device made of a balancing lever, drive cogwheel and tractive chain to implement the required tractive force of the trolley in coupling; this solution’s efficiency is demonstrated for experimental works on hard soils with high coefficient of difficulty...|$|E

The measuring equipment consists of a process parameter measuring and data storing system and a bi-plane video recording system. The measuring and data storage system is equipped with four sensors which measure the rotation speed of the main shaft, the movements of arms in the picking-up and laying-off zones, and {{the movements of the}} pedal regulator used to control the sewing dynamics. The bi-plane video recording system is used to record simultaneously the <b>working</b> <b>movements</b> (working methods) performed at the discussed workplace. From the process parameter measurements graphs for the technological operation structure are obtained, including the duration of individual suboperations and changes occuring due to pedal regulator movements. The bi-plane video recording system investigates the working method employed, the basic movements and and the optimal logical sets of movements, as well as the cyclograms of the movements used to define space and time values.

40|$|Overheating during implant site {{preparation}} negatively affects the osseointegration process {{as well the}} final outcome of implant rehabilitations. Piezoelectric techniques seem to provide to a gentle implant preparation although few scientific reports have investigated the heat generation and its underlying factors. To investigate, through a proper methodological approach, the main factors influencing temperature rise during piezoelectric implant {{site preparation}}. Different piezoelectric tips (IM 1 s, IM 2, P 2 - 3, IM 3, Mectron Medical Technology, Carasco, Italy) have been tested. The experimental set-up consisted in a mechanical positioning device equipped with a load cell and a fluoroptic thermometer. The first tip of the sequence (IM 1 s) generated the highest temperature increasing (ΔT). The diamond tips (IM 1 s and P 2 - 3) determined higher ΔT values than the smooth tips (IM 2 and IM 3). Further tests with IM 1 s suggested that the temperature elevation during the first thirty seconds may be predictive of the maximal temperature {{as well as of}} the overall thermal impact. Working load, <b>working</b> <b>movements</b> management and bone features resulted to be the main factors influencing temperature rise during piezoelectric implant site preparation.

40|$|Monuments {{are raised}} {{all over the}} world of several {{different}} reasons. A monument dosen´t only refer just to itself, it also tells something about the historical context they are risen into. The overall {{purpose of this study is}} to try to reveal how history is used through the process, and rising of the monument "Vindarnas Boning" in Karlstad, Sweden 16 / 6, 1967. The historical narrative around this monument is about to show the importance of the esthetics, the main forces around the monument and last, how the monument legitimacy is maintained. Throughout those analytic tools, according to this study, I will try to examine possible other reasons behind this monument than the official one, who is to act as a remembrance of the finnish immigrants who settled in the unpopulated deep forests of Sweden and enabled to maintain a minor community separated from other influences, during the 16 th century and onward. The 1960 ´s is characterized by the large <b>working</b> <b>movements</b> between Sweden and Finland. Also the Finnish authorities launches an economical campaign in Sweden to broaden their export possibilities. This campaign is about to show the new modern Finland, with increasing own independence from Soviet influences. Referred to this, the study shows how other groups in the society possible uses history for their own purposes, the cultural ties between Sweden and Finland are strengthen through this monument, wich gains advantages in other areas as well. Referred to the economics and the thoughts of a Nordic cooperation, which some elements wishes to broaden. Through the historical narrative this study reveals actors who has strong ties to these goals. Because of this, there might be a reason to ask if the official remembrance is the only factor that is linked to this monument. This study connects the use of history through monuments with ideological reasons. This perhaps, can be a perspective to have in mind, when visiting the monument "Vindarnas Boning" next time, or other monuments as well...|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} about {{the work of the}} {{documentary}} protagonist in constituting the image. It {{is about the}} work of the protagonist in landscape – or rather land [...] documentary, contributing to the image, be that affectively or materially as part of the aesthetics of the image. It regards the protagonist as the material of the documentary image. The essay suggests that in contrast to landscape painting, in documentary, the protagonists’ manual labor not only shapes the land, but also the image. The work of the manual laborers on the land has a causal connection to the documentary image even with respect to landscape – the “scaped” or shaped view of the land. In contrast to the landscape painting that is associated with the contemplation of the artist {{in the absence of the}} worker in the image, it is argued here that the aesthetics of the documentary image are directly dependent on the material labor of the documentary protagonist in the image. The labor of the protagonist contributes to the aesthetics of the documentary image. The essay reads that image as a space that has already been inscribed and generated by multiple human and non-human directors and protagonists, well before the last artist claims ownership. It explores the material labor of the protagonist as part of the aesthetics of the image especially through the example of central perspective, which is conventionally regarded as being constructed only within the image, by the artist for the viewer. This essay regards the vanishing point in the documentary image as having a material connection with the world it depicts. It also questions the benefits of making the worker visible through the realist documentary image and suggests that allowing the worker to be invisible while still showing their <b>working</b> <b>movements</b> precludes additional immaterial labor of the protagonist for the documentary. Finally, it looks at documentaries that explore work by means of aesthetics beyond realism including “happy” images of material labor...|$|E
40|$|The folk-dance has today, and in {{the past}} it had much more, beside its {{entertaining}} and recreation role, beside its magic role in the past, some social functions too. In northern regions of Croatia, especially in Slavonia, the dance is a public tribune on which numerous events in the life of village, country and all the world are analized. The love, the woman rival, the father, the mother, the priests, the landlords, the political conditions are talked about in couplets of the song accompanying dance. Those who are guilty of something do not approach the »kolo«, because the »počimalja«, who leads the song, would make a poignant verse on their account and they -would be made object of derision. Nondancers, children and old men, who come not only to see something but also to hear about the most recent events, gather around the »kolo«. In Dinara region the bachelors choose in the »kolo« the future wives. In Lika there were three fairs: on »Velika Gospa« — »zagledač« (of looking at girls), on »Mala Gospa« — »probirač« (of selecting the girl), and on St. Petka day — »podmorač« (who ought to). At the first fair the bachelors look the girls, at the second they selecting and at the third they ought to choose one, as the names of the fairs themself tell us. And this choosing is made just in the »kolo«. They watch, which one of the girls will dance longest, which one will jump highest and even which one will dance longer than a boy. They will preferably and quickest marry such a girl. In the same region the entering of a girl in a »kolo« signifiles that she is ready for matrimony, that she has prepared her »dota«, the dowry. A rigid sequence in marrying caused, that the younger sister could enter in a »kolo« only if the older one is married. The initiation fests among many primitive peoples comprised the training of dances necessary for ceremony and for magic uses. Many of these were {{at the same time a}} teaching to work too, they contained <b>working</b> <b>movements.</b> And in our country a woman from Lika teaches her child the sowing movements dancing: In this way the »kolo« is danced, jump and step, In this way the grain is sown, take and throw. Maybe and some other plays are rests of such teaching the <b>working</b> <b>movements</b> by means of a song and dance »Sejala sam lenek« (I sowed the flax) and so on. Folk-dance gives opportunity for givig vent to some fundamental and inborn human characteristics. The dancer can improvise on the basic rhytmical sheme, he can excel in particular, he can display his individual skill, but his dancing ought to harmonize with the collective. The national awakening expressed itself in the dance too. The folk-dances were danced at the parties from the time of Gaj 2 ̆ 7 s Illyrians till the last war. The dances get names from it, e. g. »Croatian« or from the appelation of political parties, as »radikalka« for example. In the partisan struggle the dance played a very important role specially »Kozaračko kolo« (»kolo« from Kozara). The combatants from cities and from villages, of different nationalities and professions, found in it a simple means of expression, in which they all could jointly participate. Only the folk-dance, in course of centuries polished for collective expression, could supply a simple melody, a verse first told by an individual and then repeated easily by all, who listened to the voice, important and equal in the collective. The social role of the dance manifests itself in a series of other modularities. In some regions the dance partialy serves as a means of earning material goods, it accomplishes important wedding tasks, it educates and soothes the social, religious, national and differences in age, it transfers in its civic couple form the urban civilization in the village, etc. The social role of the folk-dance has today a particular importance. Dancing groups act all over the world. The dance with its simple beauty and immediateness is a medium for drawing near different nations, for their better mutual acquaintance...|$|E
