5|$|In {{the next}} match, Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Umaga. Both men {{performed}} {{a variety of}} wrestling maneuvers, including a DDT from Triple H onto Umaga, and a Samoan drop from Umaga onto Triple H. Umaga attacked Triple H's ribs throughout the match, but Triple H gained an advantage when Umaga missed a hip attack. Umaga attempted to splash Triple H, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> turnbuckle, but Triple H moved and Umaga crashed into the ring post. Triple H then performed a Pedigree for the pinfall, thereby retaining his championship.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} Vithoba temples in Maharashtra, {{and some in}} Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur. The temple's date of {{establishment}} is disputed, though {{it is clear that}} it <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13thcentury. Along with Vithoba and his consorts—Rukmini, Satyabhama and Radha—other Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi; Garuda and Hanuman (see previous section). Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; Khandoba, a form of Shiva; and Annapurna, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati. The samadhis (memorials) of saints like Namdev, Chokhamela and Janabai, and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra, are in and around the temple. Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located: at Dehu, the birthplace of Tukaram, which attracts visitors at all ekadashis of the year; at Kole (Satara district), in memory of Ghadge Bova, which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight (waxing moon) in Magha month; at Kolhapur and Rajapur, which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi; Madhe— a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the Birla Mandir in Shahad.|$|E

This event was witnessed by at least one passing motorist.|$|E

500|$|Both Cano and de Fivas {{say that}} whilst {{en route to}} Spinetta Marengo Moustache {{took part in a}} small {{engagement}} between a company of his regiment and some Austrians. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of the company when he received a bayonet wound to his left shoulder. [...] Moustache spent several days recovering in the hospital of the regimental surgeon. [...] Though he was not fully recovered from the wound, still having a limp, Moustache is said to have taken to the field with the regiment on 14 June 1800 at the Battle of Marengo. [...] During the battle he persistently barked at the Austrian forces and was only dissuaded from attacking them by their fixed bayonets.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E

On June 28, 1869 at Fulton Ferry, while he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of a dock, working on fixing the location where the bridge would be built, his foot was crushed by an arriving ferry. His injured toes were amputated. He refused further medical treatment and wanted to cure his foot by [...] "water therapy" [...] (continuous pouring of water over the wound). His condition deteriorated. He died on July 22, 1869 of tetanus at the home of his son on Hicks Street, in Brooklyn Heights. It was just 24 days after the accident. Roebling is buried in the Riverview Cemetery in Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of March 6, 1976, the house was {{investigated}} by Ed and Lorraine Warren, {{a husband and wife}} team self-described as demonologists, together with a crew from the television station Channel 5 New York and reporter Michael Linder of WNEW-FM. During the course of the investigation Gene Campbell took a series of infrared time-lapse photographs. One of the images allegedly showed a [...] "demonic boy" [...] with glowing eyes who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of a staircase. The photograph did not emerge into the public domain until 1979, when George and Kathy Lutz and Rod Steiger appeared on The Merv Griffin Show to promote the release of the first film. 112 Ocean Avenue was also investigated by the parapsychologist Hans Holzer. The Warrens and Holzer have suggested that the house is occupied by malevolent spirits due to its history.|$|E
2500|$|Down the dial, Dallas' CBS Radio {{affiliate}} KRLD {{concluded the}} coverage of the presidential party's arrival at Love Field and switched to reporter Bob Huffaker who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corner of Main and Akard Streets in the downtown area, just 1/2 mile east of Dealey Plaza where the shooting occurred. [...] After the president's car passed him, Huffaker continued reporting for several more minutes and was said to have been on the air as the shooting took place (although shots cannot be heard in the audio coverage). [...] Shortly after returning to regular programming with the nationally syndicated religious program Back To The Bible, the first reports of the shooting came through CBS Radio. [...] Huffaker was not aware of the developments until he arrived back at the KRLD studio after wrapping up his coverage; he quickly drove out to Parkland Hospital to report the scene outside the hospital's emergency entrance.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, the twenty-fifth {{anniversary of}} Powell's [...] "Rivers of Blood" [...] speech, Powell {{wrote an article}} for The Times, in which he claimed the {{concentration}} of immigrant communities in inner cities would lead to [...] "communalism", which would have grave effects on the electoral system: [...] "communalism and democracy, as the experience of India demonstrates, are incompatible". In May, he spoke for Alan Sked of the Anti-Federalist League (the forerunner of the United Kingdom Independence Party) who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Newbury by-election. Sked went on to lose his deposit at the by-election, polling only 601 votes (1.0%). At Michael Portillo's fortieth birthday party the same month, Thatcher greeted him enthusiastically and asked him: [...] "Enoch, I haven't seen you since your eightieth-birthday dinner. How are you?" [...] Powell replied, [...] "I'm eighty-one". Powell's opinion of Thatcher had declined after she endorsed John Major at the 1992 general election, which he {{believed to be a}} repudiation of her fight against European integration after the Bruges speech.|$|E

2500|$|To {{justify the}} use of deadly force, it is not enough, however, for the police officer to merely express a {{subjective}} fear of death or great bodily harm. Unreasonable fear cannot justify {{the use of}} deadly force. The use of deadly force must be objectively reasonable and necessary, given {{the totality of the}} circumstances. Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of the facts of this case, it is my conclusion that the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez was not justified, and that sufficient facts exist to prove that to be true. Accordingly, we filed a criminal complaint this morning in Ramsey County.In his press conference announcing his decision to prosecute Yanez, Choi noted facts not consistent with a justified fear of Castile, namely that Yanez's partner, Officer Kauser, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> car's passenger window during the shooting, [...] "did not touch or remove his gun from its holster",and that in his answers to questioning by Saint Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde immediately after the shooting, Yanez [...] "stated he did not know where [...] gun was".

2500|$|With the Down loop occupied, {{night shift}} {{signalman}} Meakin decided to shunt the local passenger train onto the Up main line. At {{this point the}} southbound empty coal train <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Up Home signal {{to the north of}} Quintinshill, and accordingly it was still occupying the section from Kirkpatrick (the next signalbox to the north). [...] This meant that signalman Meakin had not yet telegraphed Kirkpatrick the [...] "train out of section" [...] signal for the empty coal train, and he could not send the [...] "blocking back" [...] signal to advise the Kirkpatrick signalman that the local train was standing on the Up main line. [...] Once the local train had crossed onto the Up main line, Meakin allowed the empty coal wagon train to proceed into the Up loop. [...] Arriving late aboard the local train, the early day shift signalman Tinsley reached Quintinshill signalbox shortly after 6.30 am. At 6.34 am one of the signalmen (it was never established which) gave the [...] "train out of section" [...] bell to Kirkpatrick for the coal train. At this point, two crucial failures in signalling procedure occurred (see Rules breaches).|$|E
