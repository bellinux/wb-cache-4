5|$|William IV died {{soon after}} inheriting the castle, but William V, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age in 1200, was {{increasingly}} involved in wider baronial politics, including serving in Ireland with King John, and {{taking part in}} the First Barons' War. He sided with the rebels against John during the civil war and was captured at Rochester Castle, leading to his estates, including Eynsford, being forfeited to the Crown. He recovered them {{after the end of the}} war and later became the constable of Hertford Castle. His daughter's son, William VI, inherited the castle in 1231; around this time, the hall of the castle burnt down and was rebuilt, complete with glazed windows. Both William VI and his son William VII died young, ending the family line in 1261.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could {{effectively}} train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft law—conscription—as a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were actually drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt. The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. European immigrants joined the Union Army in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland.|$|E

500|$|Thus Thrasybulus won praise as an Athenian patriot and staunch, principled democrat.

[...] McCain's push for normalization was opposed by some leading Senate Republicans, including Phil Gramm and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. [...] In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam.

A pretender to the throne, Boris Kalamanos, who had already claimed Hungary during Béla the Blind's reign, temporarily captured Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) with the assistance of German mercenaries in early 1146. In retaliation, Géza, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age in the same year, invaded Austria and routed Henry Jasomirgott, Margrave of Austria, in the Battle of the Fischa.|$|E

[...] Anak was a biblical figure said to be the forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants.

500|$|Cristina Kirchner, {{the first}} elected female {{president}} in Argentine history, is a Peronist who has occasionally {{been referred to}} as [...] "The New Evita." [...] Kirchner says she does not want to compare herself to Evita, claiming she was a unique phenomenon in Argentine history. Kirchner also says that women of her generation, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age in the 1970s during the military dictatorships in Argentina, owe a debt to Evita for offering an example of passion and combativeness. On 26 July 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Perón's death, a museum opened in her honor called Museo Evita. The museum, created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriquez, houses many of Eva Perón's clothes, portraits, and artistic renderings of her life, and has become a popular tourist attraction. The museum was opened in a building that was once used by the Eva Perón Foundation.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Animal House {{received}} mixed reviews from critics but several immediately recognized its appeal, and it has since been {{recognized as one of the}} best films of 1978. The film holds a 91% positive rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Its consensus states [...] "The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Lives irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, [...] "It's anarchic, messy, and filled with energy. It assaults us. Part of the movie's impact comes from its sheer level of manic energy. ... But the movie's better made (and better acted) than we might at first realize. It takes skill to create this sort of comic pitch, and the movie's filled with characters that are sketched a little more absorbingly than they had to be, and acted with perception". Ebert later placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978, the only National Lampoon film to have received this honor. In his review for Time, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "At its best it perfectly expresses the fears and loathings of kids <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age in the late '60s; at its worst Animal House revels in abject silliness. The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows". Gary Arnold wrote in his review for The Washington Post, [...] "Belushi also controls a wicked array of conspiratorial expressions with the audience. ... He can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius". David Ansen wrote in Newsweek, [...] "But if Animal House lacks the inspired tastelessness of the Lampoon's High School Yearbook Parody, this is still low humor of a high order". Robert Martin wrote in The Globe and Mail, [...] "It is so gross and tasteless you feel you should be disgusted but it's hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny". Time magazine proclaimed Animal House one of the year's best.|$|E
