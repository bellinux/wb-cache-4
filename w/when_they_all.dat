5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E

However, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> go to Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams the door before he {{gets a chance to}} enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first agent, and was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed agent, and as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him back as a client, and she eventually accepts.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E

Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning over the head with a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into bin liners, stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic is going to have new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and push it off a cliff, making it appear that Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of bad people, and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|E

25|$|According to Liu Xiang’s book Lienü zhuan written much later, around 18 BCE, Jie was {{corrupted}} by his infatuation with his concubine Mo Xi (妺喜 or 末喜), who was beautiful, but completely lacking in virtue. Among other things, {{she liked to}} drink, enjoyed music, and also had a penchant for jugglers and sing-song girls. Apparently, she had Jie order a lake of wine made. They both sailed about in the alcohol lake in an orgy of drunken naked men and women bathing and drinking. She then commanded 3,000 men to drink the lake dry, only to laugh <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> drowned. This event was also recorded in the Han Ying’s book Han shi waizhuan.|$|E

Whedon called the shot the [...] "single greatest thing we ever did".

500|$|MK Dons {{initially}} {{maintained that}} any debate was pointless as their club {{was simply a}} renamed Wimbledon F.C.. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004: [...] "MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon", he wrote. One reader asked: [...] "Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, {{do you agree that}} AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and [...] "left their team before their team left them". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had [...] "abdicated their right to it <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> walked away." [...] "The fans who have continued to support us from London—they're the ones who've {{had to put up with}} this shit for so long," [...] he concluded.|$|E
500|$|Dorothy gains {{control of}} the Flying Monkeys by giving back the group's Magic Biker Cap to Sal Minella. She has Scarecrow and Tin Thing rebuilt by the Flying Monkeys. Then {{she and her friends}} travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> storm into the Wizard's room, they {{discover}} it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard (Jeffrey Tambor) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying [...] "take me home to Aunt Em".|$|E

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> come, we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!"

2500|$|The fifth season {{once again}} {{received}} mostly positive critical reception. Season 5 {{was given a}} weighted average of 78 out of 100 by Metacritic. Variety said that [...] "The ABC series remains one of primetime's most uncompromising efforts, and this year's latest wrinkle on flashbacks, flash-forwards and island-disappearing flashes of light does nothing to alter that perception." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Newark Star Ledger said that season 5 may finally be [...] "a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show's science-fiction trappings, and those who prefer {{not to think about}} them." [...] Sepinwall also related that [...] "I loved every minute. But I'm also a geek who read Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov growing up." [...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com criticized the use of time travel saying that [...] "when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of God into the picture, then uses it without restraint, the story loses its anchor to real life." [...] The critic also asked [...] "Why does it matter what Locke and Richard Alpert and Daniel Faraday or anyone else does, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> seem as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers? How can these characters have any concrete agenda or strategic approach or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another Act of God every few seconds?" [...] The New York Times also commented that [...] "what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show's willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot: the struggles between faith and reason; the indictments of extreme capitalism, the futility of recovery. All that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out, now, in Jack Shephard's belief that returning to the island is his Destiny." [...] The A.V. Club said of the fifth-season finale, [...] "Me? I found the ending frustrating, but in a good way. This finale was entertaining as all get-out to me, and despite the occasional groaner moment, I think this may be Lost's most purposeful, surprising finale." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell them what to do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E
