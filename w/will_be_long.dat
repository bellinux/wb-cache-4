5|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of overcrowding, the station began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading to both the Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due to be finished by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station and add a new relief bank of escalators there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as access to platforms from the new escalators <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.|$|E

25|$|The {{thickness}} of the wall should, in my opinion, be such that armed men meeting {{on top of it}} may pass one another without interference. In the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made of charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like pins, to give it lasting endurance. For that is a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require a thickness like that of a city wall, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> in falling to decay if tied in this manner.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{political}} controversies and their age difference—he was fifteen years her senior—Helena {{was happy with}} Christian and was determined to marry him. As a younger son of a non-reigning duke, {{the absence of any}} foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in Britain—the Queen's primary concern—and she declared the marriage would go ahead. Helena and Christian were actually third cousins in descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales. Relations between Helena and Alexandra remained strained, and Alexandra was unprepared to accept Christian (who was also a third cousin to Alexandra in descent from King Frederick V of Denmark) as either a cousin or brother-in-law. The Queen never forgave the Princess of Wales for accusations of possessiveness, and wrote of the Waleses shortly afterwards: [...] "Bertie is most affectionate and kind but Alix [...] is by no means what she ought to be. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>long,</b> if ever, before she regains my confidence." ...|$|E

[...] She also said that the song was a highlight in the pop music genre and added, [...] "There is little doubt that '...Baby One More Time' <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> remembered as one of the cornerstones of pop music in general, and it is a strong front-runner as the prototype for the late 90s pop resurgence." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com considered [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] as Spears's best song, saying, [...] "the song is full of hooks and a big mainstream pop sound. The accompanying schoolgirl video caused a sensation, and, when the single hit No. 1, Britney was assured of stardom." [...] In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] was ranked sixth in a list of Spears's best songs. She noted the singer [...] "somehow made the school girl outfit and pink pom-pom hair-ties trendy again, worn by every tween in the succeeding years." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Hannah Rosebery's homes, {{the lease}} on Lansdowne House was {{surrendered}} shortly before her death, when the Roseberys purchased 38 Berkeley Square. This property {{was transformed into}} one of London's most luxurious town houses. However, Lady Rosebery did not {{live to see the}} work completed. Her son Harry sold the house in 1938, and it was demolished. A year later a bomb landed on the empty site during World War II. The Durdans was bequeathed to her daughter, Sybil, in 1929 and was sold together with its contents in 1955. Lord and Lady Rosebery's library there was given to the nation at this time. Mentmore, the grandest of the Roseberys' homes, was sold by Lady Rosebery's grandson, the 7th Earl of Rosebery, in 1977, together with the Rothschild art collection, which Lady Rosebery had not only been intensely interested in but had enlarged considerably. She personally catalogued the collection, and prophetically wrote in the preface [...] "In time to come, when, like all collections, this will be dispersed (and I hope this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>long</b> after my death) this book may be of value." [...] Her two-volume work and the collection it described remained so unknown that [...] "" [...] (a group attempting to halt the sale of Mentmore to keep the collection within Britain) failed largely due to widespread public ignorance of both house and collection. A few pieces of furniture and paintings were taken to Dalmeny, (the only house to remain in the family) where they are displayed today, and three pictures including Drouais' Madame de Pompadour were purchased for the National Gallery. The remainder of the collection was dispersed in a week-long sale and is now scattered across the globe. A further sale of the [...] "Continental Library," [...] to which she had added, was conducted in 1995 at the Aeolian Hall, London by Sotheby's.|$|E
