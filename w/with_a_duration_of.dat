5|$|Events <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> {{less than}} about two seconds are {{classified}} as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, {{there has been no}} association with supernovae.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} 5.7(Mw) earthquake occurred inland {{near the}} southern coast of Mexico {{at a depth of}} 24km (14.9mi), <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> nearly one minute and an epicenter about 55km (34mi) west of Ometepec, Guerrero. In the region, the Cocos, North American, and Caribbean Plates converge and create a tectonic zone of continuous seismic activity. The quake struck near the eastern periphery of the Guerrero seismic gap, which extends from Acapulco to IxtapaZihuatanejo and contains enough seismic energy to generate an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.5, but it did not cause the gap to rupture. Initial estimates from the USGS placed its intensity at a magnitude of 5.8(Mw); the National Seismological Service registered the earthquake at magnitude 5.5(ML).|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Alibera was {{the second}} longest-lasting {{tropical}} cyclone on record in the south-west Indian Ocean, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> 22days. It formed on December16, 1989, well to the northeast of Madagascar. For several days, it meandered southwestward while gradually intensifying. On December20, Alibera intensified to tropical cyclone status with 10‑minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), or {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane. That day, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an unofficial warning agency for the region, estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). After drifting erratically for several days, the storm began a steady southwest motion on December29 as a greatly weakened system. On January1, Alibera struck southeastern Madagascar near Mananjary, having re-intensified to just below tropical cyclone status. It weakened over land but again restrengthened upon reaching open waters on January3. The storm turned to the southeast, then to the southwest, and finally back to the southeast, dissipating on January5.|$|E

Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope {{and down to the}} floor. The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest. The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino. Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss over the top rope and down to the floor.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a bilateral agreement {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{effectiveness}} of early intervention {{for patients with}} first-episode psychosis is uncertain. This study aimed to explore the association <b>of</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis and short-term clinical outcome. Patients and Methods: Ninety four patients receiving treatment from an early intervention programme in Hong Kong (the Early Assessment Service for Young People with First-episode Psychosis) were retrospectively assessed using a standardised survey {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis and 1 -year outcome variables such as treatment adherence, time to treatment response, and academic and occupational functioning. Results: Patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shorter <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis had better treatment adherence and responded to treatment more quickly than patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> longer <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis. However, patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shorter <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis were more likely to be admitted to hospital during their first psychotic episode. <b>Duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis was not related to the level of occupational functioning and the risk for relapse after stabilisation of first-episode psychosis. Conclusions: These findings suggest that patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shorter <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis tend to present more acutely, yet have a faster rate of recovery, than patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> longer <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis. <b>Duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis has a significant effect on treatment adherence in the initial recovery phase. However, further studies are required to evaluate the relationship between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis and long-term outcome, as well as the impact <b>of</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> untreated psychosis on the subsequent utilisation of health services. © 2005 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

RCA Victor's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression. Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period (and RCA's own parched revenues), Victor's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933.|$|E
25|$|Duration is {{a linear}} {{measure of how}} {{the price of a}} bond changes in {{response}} to interest rate changes. It is approximately equal to the percentage change in price for a given change in yield, and may be thought of as the elasticity of the bond's price with respect to discount rates. For example, for small interest rate changes, the duration is the approximate percentage by which the value of the bond will fall for a 1% per annum increase in market interest rate. So the market price of a 17-year bond <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> 7 would fall about 7% if the market interest rate (or more precisely the corresponding force of interest) increased by 1% per annum.|$|E
