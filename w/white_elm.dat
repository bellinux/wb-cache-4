25|$|In the American Revolution 'The Liberty Tree' was an American <b>white</b> <b>elm</b> in Boston, Massachusetts, {{in front}} of which, from 1765, the first {{resistance}} meetings were held against British attempts to tax the American colonists without democratic representation. When the British, knowing that the tree {{was a symbol of}} rebellion, felled it in 1775, the Americans took to widespread 'Liberty Elm' planting, and sewed elm symbols on to their revolutionary flags. Elm-planting by American Presidents later became something of a tradition.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> Ulmus laevis has {{received}} much attention. Whilst this elm has little innate resistance to Dutch elm disease, {{it is not}} favoured by the vector bark beetles and thus only becomes colonized and infected {{when there are no}} other choices, a rare situation in western Europe. Research in Spain has suggested that it may be the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, which makes the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease. However this possibility has not been conclusively proven. More recently, Field Elms Ulmus minor highly resistant to DED have been discovered in Spain, and form the basis of a major breeding programme.|$|E

2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as wych elm and European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root-suckers remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} the merger rate of double degenerate binaries containing extremely low mass (ELM) < 0. 3 Msun white dwarfs in the Galaxy. Such white dwarfs are detectable for timescales of 0. 1 Gyr [...] 1 Gyr in the ELM Survey; the binaries they reside in have gravitational wave merger times of 0. 001 Gyr [...] 100 Gyr. To explain the observed distribution requires that most <b>ELM</b> <b>white</b> dwarf binary progenitors detach {{from the common}} envelope phase with < 1 hr orbital periods. We calculate the local space density of <b>ELM</b> <b>white</b> dwarf binaries and estimate a merger rate of 3 e- 3 /yr over the entire disk of the Milky Way; the merger rate in the halo is 10 times smaller. The <b>ELM</b> <b>white</b> dwarf binary merger rate exceeds {{by a factor of}} 40 the formation rate of stable mass transfer AM CVn binaries, marginally exceeds the rate of underluminous supernovae, and is identical to the formation rate of R CrB stars.

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{photometric}} variability of nine stars with spectroscopic Teff and log(g) values from the ELM Survey that locate them near the empirical extremely low-mass (<b>ELM)</b> <b>white</b> dwarf instability strip. We discover three new pulsating stars: SDSS J 135512. 34 + 195645. 4, SDSS J 173521. 69 + 213440. 6 and SDSS J 213907. 42 + 222708. 9. However, these {{are among the}} few ELM Survey objects that do not show radial velocity variations to confirm the binary nature expected of helium-core white dwarfs. The dominant 4. 31 -hr pulsation in SDSS J 135512. 34 + 195645. 4 far exceeds the theoretical cutoff for surface reflection in a white dwarf, and this target is likely a high-amplitude delta Scuti pulsator with an overestimated surface gravity. We estimate the probability to be less than 0. 0008 that the lack of measured radial velocity variations in four of eight other pulsating candidate <b>ELM</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs could be due to low orbital inclination. Two other targets exhibit variability as photometric binaries. Partial coverage of the 19. 342 -hr orbit of WD J 030818. 19 + 514011. 5 reveals deep eclipses that imply a primary radius > 0. 4 solar radii [...] too large to be consistent with an <b>ELM</b> <b>white</b> dwarf. The only object for which our time series photometry adds support to the <b>ELM</b> <b>white</b> dwarf classification is SDSS J 105435. 78 - 212155. 9, with consistent signatures of Doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations. We interpret that the ELM Survey contains multiple false positives from another stellar population at Teff < 9000 K, possibly related to the sdA stars recently reported from SDSS spectra.
