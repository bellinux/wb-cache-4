5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness <b>was</b> <b>painful,</b> she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E

The team was guaranteed entry for the first five races after purchasing Penske Racing's No. 77 points. This didn't help the team as BDR's expansion <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> and occurred without Dodge support, with Waltrip failing to qualify several times and failing to finish in the top 35 in points. With Waltrip starting his own Toyota team in 2007, and BDR also switching to Toyota, Waltrip took the points with him to MWR.|$|E
25|$|A perhaps {{unavoidable}} {{consequence of}} the reforms was the alienation {{of some of the}} members and Council officers. The drastic {{reduction in the number of}} Councillors meant that many regional positions in particular no longer existed. Some members left the organisation and many transferred their active loyalty to the Bird Observers Club. Independent regional groups were established to cater for those who felt disenfranchised by the new order, replacing previous RAOU branches. A comparison of the names of Council officers between 1968 and 1972 shows almost complete replacement, with most change occurring between 1969 and 1970. The process of renewal <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> and the sense of alienation, for some, was permanent.|$|E

25|$|Eritrea has {{achieved}} {{significant improvements in}} health care {{and is one of the}} few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets in health, in particular child health. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 39.1 in 1960 to 59.5 years in 2008, maternal and child mortality rates have dropped dramatically and the health infrastructure has been expanded. Due to Eritrea's relative isolation, information and resources are extremely limited and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) found in 2008 average life expectancy to be slightly less than 63 years. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995–2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). The National Malaria Protection Unit of the Ministry of Health has registered tremendous improvements in reducing malarial mortality by as much as 85% and the number of cases by 92% between 1998 and 2006. The Eritrean government has banned female genital mutilation (FGM), saying the practice <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> and put women at risk of life-threatening health problems.|$|E

500|$|Mary Shelley and {{her husband}} Percy Bysshe Shelley had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1823. Although Percy Shelley and two of their four {{children}} died there, Italy became for Mary Shelley [...] "a country which memory painted as paradise", as she put it. The couple's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity. Percy composed a series of major poems, and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel Matilda, the historical novel Valperga, and the plays Proserpine [...] and Midas. Mary Shelley {{had always wanted to}} return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip. The return <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> as she was constantly reminded of Percy Shelley.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class.

Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell her that I did not like her, but I did not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E

500|$|Zita {{occupied}} {{her final}} years with her family. Although {{the restrictions on}} the Habsburgs entering Austria had been lifted, this only applied to those born after 10 April 1919. This meant Zita could not attend the funeral of her daughter Adelheid in 1972, which <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> for her. She also involved herself in the efforts to have her deceased husband, the [...] "Peace Emperor" [...] canonised. In 1982, the restrictions were eased, and she returned to Austria after having been absent for six decades. Over the next few years, the Empress made several visits to her former Austrian homeland, even appearing on Austrian television. In {{a series of interviews}} with the Viennese tabloid newspaper Kronen Zeitung, Zita expressed her belief that the deaths of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera, at Mayerling, in 1889, were not a double suicide, but rather murder by French or Austrian agents.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{occasionally}} {{changed his}} hair and lost or gained weight for parts, {{and he went to}} great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: [...] "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." [...] In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, [...] "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great– well, that's absolutely torturous." [...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing.

[...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E

500|$|Foot binding is {{the process}} in which the arch of a woman's feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch. These [...] "fists of flesh" [...] were seen as {{attractive}} and arousing for men and the practice was passed down as a prerequisite to marriage from mother to daughter across generations. The process of foot binding <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> and often confined women to their rooms. Few lower class women were able to have their feet bound because they needed {{to be able to walk}} normally to accomplish house work. Bound feet came to be an indication of high class and wealth for women. Chinese male reformers during the imperialism period recognized the liberation of the Chinese women as something necessary for their own sake. The humiliation that China had gone through on an international level was turned on the Chinese [...] "women". Naturally, the foot binding was recognized as [...] "national shame," [...] and people found it as a serious problem to be disappeared, thus raging anti-footbinding campaigns in the 1890s to the 1900s. Moreover, the new government that came in after the 1911 revolution banned foot binding practice. Thus, it started to disappear in the coastal areas in 1900 to 1920. However, the practice was still popular within the interior areas of China till the 1930s and even in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> for the characters.|$|E
