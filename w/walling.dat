5|$|The {{majority}} of the surviving sections are protected as scheduled monuments: the Flodden Wall at Granny's Green; the Flodden and Telfer Walls at the Vennel and Heriot Place; and the Flodden Wall at Drummond Place and Pleasance. The <b>walling</b> in Tweeddale Court and the sections within Greyfriars Kirkyard are protected as listed buildings. The walls also form part of the Edinburgh Old Town World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|According {{to one of}} {{the many}} Greek legends about the Constantinople's fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend {{explained}} the later <b>walling</b> up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The local Pennant {{sandstone}} {{is frequently}} used as <b>walling</b> material, often with limestone dressings, as {{found on the}} old Temple Meads railway station and Clifton Down railway station. Pennant sandstone is also used as large rock-faced squared blocks, described as Pennant rubble, which are used alone, eked out with plain brickwork, or incorporated into the more rugged examples of Bristol Byzantine. Much of the local transport infrastructure including the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the original Temple Meads railway station—now used as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum—were designed or built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Waller</b> {{was born}} on September 18, 1886, in Norfolk, Virginia. He {{was the son of}} Marine Corps Major General Littleton [...] "Tony" [...] <b>Waller</b> and his wife Clara Wynn <b>Waller</b> (1862-1958), the oldest of three children, his two {{brothers}} were Rear Admiral John B. W. <b>Waller</b> and Marine Corps Brigadier General Henry T. <b>Waller.</b> His cousin, James D. <b>Waller</b> was also marine officer, who served during World War II and retired as Brigadier General.|$|R
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone <b>walling</b> to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|The Park Authority {{receives}} 80% of {{its funding}} {{as a direct}} grant from the government. The Park Authority Committee consists of members from parish and county councils, and six appointed by the Secretary of State. The work is carried out by 80 staff including rangers, volunteers {{and a team of}} estate workers who carry out a wide range of tasks including maintaining the many miles of rights of way, hedge laying, fencing, swaling, <b>walling,</b> invasive weed control and habitat management on National Park Authority land. There are ongoing debates between the authority and farmers over the biological monitoring of SSSIs, showing the need for a controlled regime of grazing and burning; farmers claim that these regimes are not practical or effective in the long term.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, <b>walling</b> up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Waller</b> {{was born}} in Galway, Ireland. His family were {{descendants}} of Richard <b>Waller,</b> a lieutenant in Cromwell's New Model Army during the conquest of Ireland, who was awarded Castle Cully and its lands near Newport, County Tipperary in 1666. Richard Waller's great-grandson William Thomas <b>Waller</b> married Eliza Augusta Guinness, the granddaughter of Arthur Guinness. His eldest son George Arthur <b>Waller</b> became Guinness' Chief Brewer and Engineer, while his fourth son Francis Albert <b>Waller</b> was the managing director of Banagher Maltings (F.A. <b>Waller</b> & Co. Ltd.) in Shannon Grove, County Galway, near Banagher, County Offaly. Francis Albert <b>Waller</b> married Frances Otway on 7 September 1872, and they had nine children, of whom Albert Gregory <b>Waller</b> was the youngest.|$|R

5|$|Demolitions began {{soon after}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Jacobite threat in 1746. The bastions of the Telfer Wall along Lauriston Place were demolished in 1762, as they were obstructing traffic. The Netherbow survived until 1764, when it too was removed as an obstruction. The West Port and the Potterow Port were removed in the 1780s. By now, the New Town was under construction, and although smuggling of goods through the city walls was still being punished, complaints about the zealousness of the guards were widely circulated. The Old College of the University of Edinburgh (constructed from 1789), and then the Royal Museum of Scotland (constructed from 1861), were built over sections of the wall around the Potterow Port. Forrest Road was laid out in the 1840s, resulting in the loss of another section of the Telfer Wall. During construction works around the Advocates' Library and Parliament House in 1832 and 1845, fragments of <b>walling</b> were uncovered, which were attributed to the King's Wall. Two sections of the increasingly neglected town wall collapsed in the mid-1850s. In 1854, a large portion of wall (20 feet high and 3–4 feet thick), and the embankment against which it was built fell into Leith Wynd between the High Street and Calton Road. A week later the Dean of Guild ordered the removal of a 150 feet stretch of the wall from that location. In 1856, a lightning strike appears to have been the cause of the collapse of a 40 to 50 feet stretch of the wall enclosing Greyfriars Kirkyard.|$|E

25|$|Captain George <b>Walling</b> of the Metropolitans was {{assigned}} to carry {{out one of the}} warrants. He arrived at City Hall by himself and was allowed to speak with Mayor Wood in his private office. Learning the purpose of his visit, Wood refused to accompany <b>Walling,</b> who then attempted to take him out of the building by force. Over 300 Municipal officers were stationed at City Hall, and <b>Walling</b> was stopped and thrown out into the street. He attempted several times to re-enter, arguing with Captain Abraham Ackerman, until the arrival of Captains Jacob Sebring and Coroner Perry, leading fifty Metropolitans, to serve the second warrant.|$|E
