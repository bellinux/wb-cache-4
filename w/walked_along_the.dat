5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so he did not know how they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E

25|$|On 30 April 1944, {{after four}} days of {{intensive}} drills, PC-1264 went up the Hudson River to Iona Island to load ammunition for her guns for the first time. After loading, Lt. Purdon expected to moor there for the night, but was not allowed due to the danger from {{the large amount of}} ammunition stored there. Looking for a berth for the night, he called the duty office of the nearby U.S. Military Academy at West Point to ask if his ship could tie up at its pier. There was some confusion, as no Navy ship had tied up there in recent history. However, PC-1264, with its mostly African-American crew was made welcome, and numerous visitors <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> dock inspecting her. In addition, the U.S. Army provided two buses, and many of the enlisted crewmen were taken {{on a tour of the}} Academy under the guidance of knowledgeable sergeants.|$|E
500|$|Of her {{research}} for Falls the Shadow, Penman explains: [...] "I {{did a great}} deal of on-site research, visiting the castles and battlefields that figured in Falls the Shadow, visiting the Reading Room at the British Library, the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, and local reference libraries… Here at home, I made use of the University of Pennsylvania Library in Philadelphia, which has an excellent medieval selection. But it really helped to see the scenes for myself. At Lewes, we actually <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed. It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs, gazing out upon the same view that he would have seen".|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 1999, Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown, Jr. were {{traveling}} on a Greyhound bus bound for Detroit, Michigan. When the bus made a planned stop in Tallahassee, Florida, passengers {{were told to}} get off the bus so it could be cleaned and refueled. After the passengers re-boarded, the driver allowed Officers Blackburn, Hoover, and Lang of the Tallahassee Police Department to enter the bus [...] "as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction effort". Although the officers displayed visible badges, they carried concealed weapons and were not in uniform. Upon entering the bus, Officer Hoover knelt on the driver's seat, Officer Blackburn stood {{at the back of the}} bus, and Officer Lang <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> aisle of the bus to talk to passengers. He asked passengers which luggage was theirs and where they were going. None of the officers blocked the aisle or otherwise obstructed the exit, and passengers were free to leave while the officers conducted their investigation. However, the officers did not inform passengers of their right to refuse to cooperate with the investigation.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{supported}} by the Grotesk Burlesk Tour, with Peaches performing as opening act on select dates. It began with a series of headlining shows in Europe, followed by the band's stint as one of the headlining acts at the 2003 Ozzfest. Much of the elaborate attire and clothing worn by the band on tour was tailored by French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. The stage was designed to resemble that of classic vaudeville and burlesque stage shows of the 1930s. Two female dancers would be present on stage for most of the show, and would be dressed in either vintage burlesque costumes or military uniforms and garters. They would also perform some live instrumentation, such as floor toms during [...] "Doll-Dagga Buzz-Buzz Ziggety-Zag", and piano during [...] "The Golden Age of Grotesque". They performed the latter whilst dressed to resemble conjoined twins. Manson would change his appearance numerous times throughout each show: he would wear elongated arms which he would swing in a marching manner as he <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> stage, and would don blackface while wearing an Allgemeine SS-style peaked police cap or Mickey Mouse ears. The stage also utilized a series of elaborate platforms and pulpits, from atop of which he would quote random lines from Doppelherz between songs. The tour was set to end with five concerts featuring Marilyn Manson opening for Jane's Addiction. However, these shows were cancelled by the latter band, with Perry Farrell citing exhaustion as the reason.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days after}} the shooting, Heney was {{represented}} by Selim M. Franklin at the inquest into Handy's death. Cameron, the court clerk, testified that Handy had repeatedly threatened to kill Heney. Witnesses testified that {{on more than one}} occasion, as the lawyer <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> street, Handy had intentionally attempted to run Heney over with his buggy. Witnesses and Heney told the court that Handy had attacked Heney. Many prominent witnesses affirmed that Heney acted in self-defense. Although Handy had a revolver, [...] he had not removed it from his pocket. The judge found that Heney had acted in self-defense and exonerated Heney from any charges.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his spare}} time, he visited museums, rare bookshops, and <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{banks of the}} Seine, with {{frequent}} stops at the book stands. He would purchase rare books, engravings, lithographs and drawings. As he himself later noted, his taste for art was shaped by Cantacuzino, [...] "one of the greatest experts in painting and printing that I have ever met." [...] Together with other young Romanians, he was a regular customer at several cafés, including Procop, Soleil d'Or, and Café Voltaire. It was {{in this context that}} both Cantacuzino and Slătineanu became followers of socialism. They drew sympathy from Jean Jaurès, Georges Clemenceau and René Viviani, and were allowed to write in local newspapers about the ongoing controversy regarding the Transylvanian Memorandum signatories. Upon his return home in 1902, he became chief of operations at the experimental medicine department, newly established by Cantacuzino within the University of Bucharest's medical faculty.|$|E

[...] A friend {{reported}} that Hardwick suddenly toppled into the water as they <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> shore. [...] Shortly after Hardwick's death, sports columnist Grantland Rice wrote a column about Hardwick in which he observed:"Tack Hardwick has been a close friend of mine for 35 years. [...] Of all the college football players I've ever known since 1900, I would say he was top man in the matter of flaming spirit. [...] He loved football with an intensity beyond belief. [...] Tack was a great halfback and a great end. [...] But above all, as a real tribute, he was a greater blocker and a greater tackler. [...] He told me once that he would rather block or tackle than carry the ball to a touchdown. … If football had a weakness for Hardwick it was that the game was not quite rough enough." ...|$|E

The , 3-hour funeral procession {{was covered in}} snow (which local newscasters described as [...] "heaven's tears") as soldiers beat their chests and called out [...] "Father, Father." [...] A Lincoln Continental limousine carried a giant portrait of Jong-il. Jong-il's casket, draped by the Korean Workers' Party flag, was carried {{on top of another}} Lincoln Continental hearse while Kim Jong-un, his uncle Jang Sung-taek was immediately behind him. Army chief of the general staff Ri Yong-ho and defence minister Vice-Marshal Kim Yong-chun <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> opposite side of the vehicle during the procession segments in the Kumsusan Memorial Palace. The procession returned to Kumsusan Palace where Jong-un stood flanked by the top party and military officials who are expected to be his inner circle of advisers as rifles fired 21 times, then saluted again as goose-stepping soldiers carrying flags and rifles marched by the palace square. Reportedly, Jong-il's body will be embalmed and put on display indefinitely in the manner of Kim Il-sung and other Communist leaders such as Lenin, Mao, and Ho Chi Minh.|$|E
2500|$|Handy relayed {{a message}} to Heney: [...] "If Frank Heney takes the case I will kill him!" [...] Handy {{publicly}} proclaimed that any attorney foolish enough to represent her in the divorce case “would be sorry.” He described his wife as [...] "a morphine fiend and a common slut." [...] His attempts to intimidate Heney had the opposite effect, pricking Heney's conscience. Heney told his brother Ben, who {{lived across the street}} from Handy, that [...] "If a lawyer can't take any case he feels it is right for him to handle, then he should take down his shingle." [...] Heney and Handy had several confrontations. On more than one occasion, as the lawyer <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> street, Handy intentionally attempted to run Heney over with his buggy. Handy called Heney a coward and a son of a bitch and tried to provoke a fight. Clerk of the Court Brewster Cameron, a friend of both Handy and Heney, warned Handy that his threats might negatively influence the court, and Handy desisted for a while.|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{documentary}} programme broadcast on the Swedish television channel SVT in February2006,, associates of Pettersson {{claimed that he}} had confessed to them {{his role in the}} murder, but with the explanation that {{it was a case of}} mistaken identity. Allegedly, Pettersson had intended to kill Sigvard Cedergren, a drug dealer who customarily <b>walked</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> same street at night and resembled Palme both in appearance and dress. [...] The programme also suggested there was greater police awareness than previously acknowledged because of surveillance of drug activity in the area. The police had several officers in apartments and cars along those few blocks of Sveavägen but, 45minutes before the murder, the police monitoring ceased. In the light of these revelations, Swedish police undertook to review Palme's case and Pettersson's role. [...] Writing in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter of 28 February 2006 other SVT reporters scathingly criticized the documentary, alleging that the film-maker had fabricated a number of statements while omitting other contradictory evidence, in particular his chief source's earlier testimony that could not be reconciled with his claim to have seen the shooting.|$|E
