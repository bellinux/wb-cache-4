[...] PC Gamer USs Steve Poole called it [...] "slick, funny," [...] "absorbing" [...] and [...] "one of the most playable adventures of all time" [...] "that will appeal {{to a wide variety}} of gamers". Amiga Powers Cam Winstanley said that it is [...] "an example of what an adventure game should be like – funny, enthralling and convincing." [...] Adventure Gamers' Claire Wood called it an [...] "enjoyable", [...] "engaging adventure classic, thoroughly enjoyable playing experience" [...] and [...] "a 1984 for the computer game generation." ...|$|E

Paul Neurath later said that the game [...] "was not a flop", but that it ultimately [...] "lost money" [...] for the company, which he attributed to its steep learning curve. Computer Gaming World praised the game's scale, physics system, and true 3D environments; the magazine extolled the presentation of Cyberspace as [...] "nothing short of phenomenal". However, the reviewer {{believed that the}} game had [...] "little sense of urgency" [...] and [...] "confusing level layouts". Computer Shopper wrote that, while the game's controls were difficult to master compared to [...] "simple run-and-shoot game like Doom", they were [...] "worth the time and effort". The reviewer noted that the game [...] "grows on you, and it <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> intrigued for weeks".|$|E

500|$|On 19 October Dyer, Robinson and Stephenson {{were brought}} before Governor Endicott, where they {{explained}} their mission for the Lord. [...] The next day, {{the same group}} was brought before the governor, who directed the prison keeper to remove the men's hats. [...] He then addressed the group, [...] "We have made many laws and endeavored in several ways {{to keep you from}} among us, but neither whipping nor imprisonment, nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon pain of death <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> from among us. [...] We desire not your death." [...] Having met his obligation to present the position of the colony's authorities, he then pronounced, [...] "Hearken now to your sentence of death." [...] William Robinson then wanted to read a prepared statement about being called by the Lord to Boston, but the governor would not allow it to be read, and Robinson was sent back to prison. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson, being less vociferous than Robinson, was allowed to speak, and though initially declining, he ultimately spoke his mind, and then was also sent back to jail.|$|E
500|$|The {{second volume}} of the manga was {{positively}} reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: [...] "With its second volume the title pushes fully {{into the realm of}} romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side that <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> coming back." [...] In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, [...] "The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less." [...] In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, [...] "these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little yuri series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking." ...|$|E
500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> tied to the past." ...|$|E

500|$|Sheila Benson, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, stated, [...] "Intelligent, complex and enthralling, Presumed Innocent ... {{is one of those}} rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where the working of the {{machinery}} never shows and after it's over, one runs and reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction." [...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|E
500|$|Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu wrote, [...] "How {{often do}} we get to watch a Telugu film where the audience, along with the protagonist and {{supporting}} characters, is also required to think and distinguish between events unfolding in real and imaginary spaces?" [...] and called 1Nenokkadine a [...] "visually stunning" [...] film. Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3.5out of five stars: [...] "As the film tries out a refined or reformed revenge saga, {{it needs to be}} seen whether 1 Nenokkadine works at the box office. If it does, it is a good sign for Telugu cinema". A. S. Sashidhar of The Times of India wrote, [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is good and <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> wanting for more. The story has a few interesting twists and turns, in the second half too to keep the audience glued to the screen", and Sukumar [...] "should be commended for superb attempt in choosing to make a film that has not been explored in Telugu movies". Shekhar of Oneindia called the film a [...] "brilliant psychological thriller": [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is excellent and will impress all classes of audience. A few sentimental scenes slow down the pace of narration in the second half. But the superb climax that lasts for 15 minutes will compensate it. The viewers will surely walk out of theatre with contented hearts".|$|E
500|$|William Wong of Computer Shopper {{called it}} [...] "a great game that {{is backed by}} good {{graphics}} and sound, and <b>will</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> going for hours"; he also praised its cutscenes. He concluded, [...] "If the [...] multiplayer pack {{is as good as}} the standalone version, Terra Nova could be a strike force to be reckoned with." [...] PC Gamer UKs James Flynn praised the game's graphics, sense of realism, and free-form missions; about the latter, he wrote, [...] "There's no right or wrong way to complete any of the missions in Terra Nova, {{and this is one of}} its strongest assets." [...] He noted that it was [...] "virtually impossible to recommend" [...] the game to those with lower-end computers, but he believed that it was also [...] "impossible to condemn Looking Glass for programming the game this way, because it feels so real, and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun". Daniel Jevons of Maximum approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long-range combat and the use of the mouse to move a crosshair rather than the entire viewpoint. However, he concluded that the game [...] "has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack, the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties, with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields". Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine praised the game's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality [...] "spectacular", but found its movement controls to be [...] "awkward". He concluded, [...] "Terra Nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic, fast-paced action with real-time squad-level tactics. It doesn't get much better than this".|$|E
