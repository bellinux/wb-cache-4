He also declared that he would make use of qualified people in the government administration, from all political camps.|$|E
25|$|Mansell's {{return to}} Williams was not straightforward. He {{would agree to}} return only if a list of demands were met, {{including}} undisputed number one status over Riccardo Patrese (who had also been his teammate in 1988), guarantees of support {{in a wide variety}} of areas with each guarantee in writing, and assurances from suppliers such as Renault and Elf that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> necessary to help him win. Frank Williams said the demands were 'impossible'; Mansell concluded that if that were the case he would be happy to retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver.|$|E
25|$|In July 1944, Vasić and {{his wife}} met with Richard Felman and other American pilots, whose B-24 Liberators were shot down by the Germans near the Serbian village of Pranjani. Vasić told Felman that the Chetniks <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> {{in their power to}} protect the downed airmen and {{explained}} that the Germans had discovered the wreckage of Felman's plane. Vasić told him that they had recovered the body of a dead American pilot and assigned a young Chetnik named Miodrag Stefanović to be Felman's bodyguard. Felman was one of several hundred American airmen who were rescued by the Chetniks during Operation Halyard, and he spent much of his life speaking fervantly about the debt he owed to the Chetniks.|$|E

5000|$|When Disney opened Central Shops in 1971, Dick Nunis, then Executive VP, told Arrow, “I have {{to admit}} that we could not have done this without you. But it’s over now. We built this big {{facility}} and we’re going to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> ourselves.” Dana Morgan, Ed’s son recalled, “They {{made it very clear that}} it was a new era—that they now had all this in-house capability built up, and they <b>would</b> now <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> themselves.” ...|$|R
25|$|Madonna was {{admitted}} to Sanator in September 1950. She found this hospital {{very different from the}} Indian San. The grounds around the building were landscaped with trees and flowers, and patients were allowed to wear their own clothing and walk around the grounds. Her doctor, Dr. W. L. Meyers vowed to Madonna’s parents that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> in his power to help their daughter. The initial treatment was to pump air into the abdomen, and after that proved to be unsuccessful, they tried pumping air into her back to collapse the bad lung, which also failed. They next tried an operation called a phrenic which would permanently collapse her infected lung, again it failed to kill the TB.|$|E
25|$|Other {{points of}} the {{agreement}} included the exchange of technical advisers, cooperation on coastal patrols, and the aerial photographing of strategic areas within Colombia. On the issue of aerial photography, Colombia {{made it clear that}} it would only be accomplished by Colombian aircraft and American cameramen. Colombia also made it clear that, although it was fully supportive of the fight against the Axis, it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> possible to limit the amount of American military activity taking place on or from its territory. The Colombians did not invite the United States to build its own military bases within their country, as Ecuador and other South American countries did. They felt that the defense of Colombia should be carried out by Colombians, and the United States did not object.|$|E
25|$|News of {{the conference}} leaked and Tory churchmen were shocked that Rochester might have wavered in his faith. Rochester {{requested}} another conference and James consented. Rochester {{let it be known}} to influential Catholics at court that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> they requested (except convert) so long as he remained in office. He told them that as a Protestant he would prove more useful to them than as a Catholic. However, on 17 December James called Rochester into an audience and told him that so high an office of Lord Treasurer could not be held by a staunch Anglican under a Catholic monarch. James asked him to think again on his refusal to convert but Rochester would not and on 4 January 1687 he was dismissed. However he received a pension of approximately £4000 per annum and £40,000 and estates from a convicted traitor.|$|E

This is the reason we had the weapons cache. The factories necessary to the war effort and train routes were to be blown up, to bring the front closer. The most recent members of our hard-srabble club knew of these plans and supported them.|$|R

If Master Fernald {{had made up}} his mind that he desired to become an inmate of aunt Dorcas's family, he <b>would</b> most likely <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> in his power to bring about such a result; and the happiness which had been Joe's because the little woman had decided to give the princess a temporary home, suddenly vanished.|$|R
25|$|The Last Day of the Twelfth Moon; on {{this holiday}} ale and fruit were {{provided}} as offerings to {{the god of}} the stove, after having Buddhist or Taoist priests recite scripture at one's own home (if one had the wealth and means). Offerings were made to the stove god because it was his responsibility to make annual reports to heaven on the good deeds or sins committed by the family in question. A family <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> to charm the god, including hanging a newly painted portrait of the god {{on a piece of paper}} above their stove on New Years, which hung in the same position for an entire year. It was a common practice to rub in some alcoholic beverage across the picture of the deities mouth, so that he would become drunk and far too inebriated to make any sort of reasonably bad or negative report about the family to heaven.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book, after seeing Harry fly masterfully {{his very first}} time on a broom, she {{recommends}} him to fill the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and sends him a broom, even though first-year students are normally prohibited from playing the sport or owning brooms. Despite {{the fact that she}} can often be heard to caution Lee Jordan's biased remarks while commenting Hogwart's Quidditch matches, it is often indirectly revealed that McGonagall herself is an avid Quidditch fan, resulting in a few occasions of her dropping her usual demeanour. Furthermore, although a rigorous disciplinarian, she often assists Harry indirectly with activities that are not strictly within the rules of Hogwarts; for example, she allows Harry and his friends to use the Transfiguration classroom to practice for tasks in the Triwizard Tournament. She promises Harry she <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> in her power to help him to achieve his goal of becoming an auror, and she keeps her promise. Despite her stern front, McGonagall is shown to have good intentions at heart and has been known to display a range of emotions, which can often be a shock to her colleagues and students.|$|E
500|$|Baxter {{then moved}} his {{headquarters}} to St. Johns College, a Masonic institution on the southeastern {{edge of the}} state. Baxter issued two proclamations to the press from his temporary office, asserting his rights to the governorship by vote {{of the people and}} the decision of the legislature; both were printed in the Gazette. He received support from many prominent Democrats in the city, all of whom had initially voted for Brooks. He then issued a dispatch to President Grant explaining the situation, calling Brooks and his band [...] "revolutionaries", and stating that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> up to and including armed conflict to regain control of the state organs. He asked for the support of the Federal Government.|$|E

[...] In answer to all this Mr. Peacocke could only {{say that it was}} impossible. This {{happened}} on Friday afternoon, Friday being a day on which the school was always very busy. There was no time for the doing of anything special, as there would be on the following day, which was a half-holiday. At night, when the work was altogether over, he showed the letter to his wife, and told her what he had decided.|$|R

500|$|By {{finishing}} as runners-up in the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset {{qualified to}} compete in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, the first global club cricket tournament. Media attention surrounded Trescothick, who had returned home early from his last overseas tour in 2006–07 with a [...] "stress-related illness". Brian Rose stressed that there was no pressure on Trescothick {{to take part in the}} tournament, and that the county <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> possible to support him. The former England batsman did take part in the tournament, arriving three days after the rest of the squad. He played in both of Somerset's matches in the group stage of the competition, though he only managed to score 17 runs between his two innings.|$|E

[...] Johnson, who was being advised by Thomas Pownall, continued to assert his exclusive authority over interactions with Indians, and renewed complaints about Shirley's interference in recruiting for the 1755 campaign. [...] In one letter Johnson wrote that Shirley had [...] "become my inveterate enemy" [...] who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> he could [...] "to blast if he can my character." [...] Johnson made common cause with the DeLanceys (to whom he was related by marriage) in their dislike of Shirley. [...] They all fed unflattering reports to the new New York governor, Sir Charles Hardy, who forwarded them on to London. [...] Shirley was unaware of this looming threat to his authority.|$|E

Oswald Garrison Villard of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), wrote in protest to Lee Cruce, governor of Oklahoma. Cruce assured Villard he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> he could to bring the killers to justice. He defended the laws of Oklahoma as [...] "adequate" [...] and its [...] "juries competent", and said the administration of justice in the state proceeded with little cause for criticism, [...] "except in cases of extreme passion, which no law and no civilization can control". He added: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{quotation}} {{has since}} been used to criticize the planning and execution of the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation. General Anthony Zinni, historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Governor Howard Dean have all used variations of the phrase in criticism of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war. Notably, Schlesinger also reported contemporaneously on Bradley's original statement back in 1951. Despite voting yes on the Authorization to Use Military Force on Iraq and not reversing his position at any time before the invasion, in September 6, 2004, at a Racine, West Virginia rally, Senator John Kerry said,I <b>would</b> not have <b>done</b> just one thing differently than the president on Iraq, I <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> differently than the president on Iraq…. You've about 500 troops here, 500 troops there and it's American troops that are 90 percent of the combat casualties and it's American taxpayers that are paying 90 {{percent of the cost}} of the war. It's the wrong war, in the wrong place at the wrong time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legislation}} delegated {{responsibility for}} creating the website to the Office of Management and Budget. Around {{the time of the}} Act's passage, OMB Watch, a government watchdog group, was developing a site that <b>would</b> <b>do</b> essentially <b>everything</b> the legislation required.Gary Bass, director of OMB Watch, contacted Robert Shea, associate director of the OMB, offering to help with development of the new site. Shea was initially reluctant to collaborate with Bass, in part because OMB Watch is typically critical of the OMB, but eventually it was determined that the government site would be based on what OMB Watch was developing, with the group being paid $600,000 for their technology. [...] As of early 2008, the government's site, USASpending.gov, offers the same data, API, and (for the most part) documentation as the OMB Watch site, fedspending.org. On May 9, 2017, Steven Mnuchin‏, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, announced that he updated the site, providing a much broader view of government spending.|$|R

[...] He felt that the [...] "just war" [...] he had signed up for was anything but just, and was disillusioned with {{the army and the}} conduct of the war. [...] In a church in the Italian village of San Martino, near Vicenza, he made a private pact with God that he would never again help to take a human life. [...] He wrote to his future wife, Ella Christian, claiming that he had become a pacifist and a conscientious objector. [...] He also began a campaign of small acts of sabotage, introducing minor errors into his trajectory calculations so as to mistarget the guns, such that they [...] "never once hit an inhabited target" [...] on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate. His actions were never discovered by his superiors.|$|E

Congressman Ryan traveled to Jonestown with 17 Bay Area relatives of Peoples Temple members, several newspaper reporters and an NBC TV team. When the legal counsel for Jones attempted to impose several restrictive conditions on the visit, Ryan responded that he would be traveling to Jonestown whether Jones permitted it or not. Ryan's stated position was that a [...] "settlement deep in the bush might be reasonably run on authoritarian lines". However, residents of the settlement must be allowed to come and go as they pleased. He further asserted that if the situation had become [...] "a gulag", he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> he could to [...] "free the captives".|$|E

It was cool, though the autumn sunshine streamed in, and the girl had somehow impressed her personality upon it. Soft colorings, furniture, even the rather incongruous mixture of statuettes and ivory carvings, blended into a harmonious whole, and the girl made a most satisfactory central figure, as she sat opposite him in her unusually thoughtful mood. He felt the charm of her presence, though he could hardly have analyzed it. As he said, it was not even needful that she should talk to him.|$|R
2500|$|After {{meeting with}} Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Germany Szögyény on 5 July, the German Emperor {{informed}} him that his state could [...] "count on Germany's full support", even if [...] "grave European complications" [...] ensued, and that Austria-Hungary [...] "ought to march at once" [...] against Serbia. He added that [...] "in any case, as things stood today, Russia {{was not at all}} ready for war, and would certainly think long before appealing to arms". Even if Russia were to act in defence of Serbia, Wilhelm promised that Germany <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> in its power, including war, to support Austria-Hungary.|$|E
