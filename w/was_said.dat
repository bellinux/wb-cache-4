40|$|A {{version of}} this paper will likely appear in the Philosophy Compass. Philosophers of {{language}} distinguish among the lexical or linguistic meaning of the sentence uttered, what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> by an utterance of the sentence, and speaker's meaning, or what is conveyed by the speaker to her audience. In most views, what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> the semantic or truth-conditional content of the utterance, and is irreducible either to the linguistic meaning or to the speaker's meaning.

The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued <b>was</b> <b>said</b> and what her employer thought <b>was</b> <b>said.</b> Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
