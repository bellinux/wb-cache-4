5|$|The Battle of Midway {{redefined the}} central {{importance}} of air superiority {{for the remainder}} of the war <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> suddenly lost their four main aircraft carriers and were forced to return home. Without any form of air superiority, the Japanese never again launched a major offensive in the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|After a brief stay in Hong Kong, {{where she}} met the disaffected KMT leader Li Jishen, Hu was in Shanghai <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{launched}} an all-out attack on the city in August 1937, {{at the beginning of}} the eight-year-long Second Sino-Japanese War. In September, she organized the Shanghai Labor Women's War Service Corps to support the 18th Army of the KMT. The women tended wounded soldiers and helped harvest rice near the battlefront at night.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> in San Francisco begins in 1869 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first <b>Japanese</b> {{immigrants}} arrived in San Francisco Bay. [...] In 1900 there were 90 Japanese businesses. By 1909 this figure increased to 545.|$|R
5|$|By early 1942, {{the colonial}} {{government}} of the Dutch East Indies had become concerned {{with the possibility of}} an invasion by the Empire of Japan. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Star, though production of 1001 Malam was incomplete, was reported to be preparing to move. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> occupied the Indies in March 1942, Star was closed, never to reopen.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Cecil Clementi {{became the}} 17th Governor of Hong Kong. Fluent in Cantonese {{and without a}} need for translator, Clementi {{introduced}} the first ethnic Chinese, Shouson Chow, into the Executive Council as an unofficial member. Under Clementi's tenure, Kai Tak Airport entered operation as RAF Kai Tak and several aviation clubs. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Empire expanded its territories from northeastern China into the mainland proper. To safeguard Hong Kong as a freeport, Governor Geoffry Northcote declared the Crown Colony as a neutral zone.|$|E
5|$|Star made four further films {{before it}} was closed in 1942, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{occupied}} the Indies; Jo Eng Sek did not direct again. After writing Tjioeng Wanara, Ariffien left Star Film {{to work at a}} circus; Biran writes that he was disappointed over the work's poor reception. Joenara, Arief, and Waldy remained in the film industry; Joenara went on to be a producer, while Arief and Waldy later took up directing. Neither Djoenaedi nor Sukran are recorded as making another film.|$|E

5|$|The Astana (Palace), {{which is}} now the {{official}} residence of the Governor of Sarawak, was constructed next to Brooke's first residence. He had it built in 1869 as a wedding gift to his wife. Kuching continued to prosper under Charles Vyner Brooke, who succeeded his father as the Third Rajah of Sarawak. In 1941, Kuching {{was the site of}} the Brooke Government Centenary Celebration. A few months later, the Brooke administration came to a close <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> occupied Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in Nanking {{did not end}} entirely {{on the night of}} December 12–13 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Army took the remaining gates and entered the city. During their mopping-up operations in the city the Japanese continued for several more days to beat back sporadic resistance from Chinese stragglers. Though Mufushan, just north of Nanking, was taken by Japan's Yamada Detachment without much bloodshed on the morning of December 14, pockets of resistance outside Nanking persisted for several more days.|$|E
5|$|Unprepared for the Allied {{operation}} at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, {{commander of the}} newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.|$|E
50|$|The Allies were {{preparing}} to make amphibious landings in Malaya <b>when</b> word of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> surrender arrived.|$|R

5|$|A 3,000-strong Army unit, as well {{as several}} Australian {{warships}} and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> invaded the island in March1942. An Army force made up of elements from the 7thDivision also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate. Following the conquest of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean, attacking Ceylon in early April. The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon {{at the time of the}} raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{special forces}} played a {{significant}} role in the Pacific War. Following the outbreak of war commando companies were deployed to Timor, the Solomon and Bismarck islands and New Caledonia. Although the 1st Independent Company was swiftly overwhelmed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> invaded the Solomon Islands in early 1942, the 2/2nd and 2/4th Independent Companies waged a successful guerrilla campaign on Timor which lasted from February 1942 to February 1943 when the Australian force was evacuated. Other commando units also played an important role in the New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville and Borneo campaigns throughout the war where they were used to collect intelligence, spearhead offensives and secure the flanks of operations conducted by conventional infantry.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1941, the {{government}} of the Dutch East Indies were concerned that Empire of Japan could invade the colony. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of the film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Union, though already beginning production of a film set in the Majapahit era titled Damar Woelan, was forced to stop filming. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> occupied the Indies in March 1942, Union was closed, never to reopen.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Army {{attacked}} Penang in December 1941, {{the airport}} {{was one of}} the first places to be hit by <b>Japanese</b> air raids. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> sought to neutralise the British and Australian air force units by targetting all airfields in Penang, including RAF Butterworth and the Bayan Lepas International Airport.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Navy {{was formed}} the Ministry of the Navy {{submitted}} potential ship names to the Emperor for approval. During {{the early years}} ships were often donated by <b>the</b> Shogunate or <b>Japanese</b> clans and <b>the</b> original clan names were kept.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> Scotland <b>Japanese</b> School (スコットランド日本語補習授業校 Sukottorando Nihongo Hoshū Jugyō Kō), {{a weekend}} Japanese school, opened in 1982, classes were {{originally}} held at Craigmount High School. The school classes {{were moved to}} Livingston in April 2003.|$|R
5|$|Decoy was {{transferred}} to the Eastern Fleet in March and was escorting Force B <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> carriers attacked Ceylon. The Japanese never spotted Force B, and the ship remained with the fleet until ordered home in September to convert to an escort destroyer. After Duncans refit was completed in January 1942, she rejoined Force H and escorted several missions to fly off Royal Air Force fighters from aircraft carriers to Malta before she {{was transferred}} to the Eastern Fleet in April to support Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Diego Suarez, in early May. She, too, was recalled to the UK to be modified as an escort destroyer.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, Frank {{began to}} find that Judy was more {{aggressive}} towards the Japanese and Korean guards. Although he'd normally send her into the jungle to avoid them, on one occasion, the guards gave chase and shot at the dog. He later found Judy bleeding from the shoulder {{where she had been}} grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some palm fronds, but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part of a plan to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces abandoned the camp.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1941 Roekiah and Djoemala {{completed}} Poesaka Terpendam (Buried Treasure), an action-filled film {{which followed}} two groups– the rightful heirs (Roekiah {{being one of}} them) and a band of criminals– in a race to find treasure buried in Banten. Roekiah and Djoemala worked on their final film together, Koeda Sembrani (The Enchanted Horse), in early 1942. In the film, adapted from One Thousand and One Nights, Roekiah took the role of Princess Shams-al-Nahar and was shown flying on a horse. The film was still incomplete <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> occupation of the Dutch East Indies began in March 1942, though it was screened by October 1943.|$|E
50|$|The air arsenal's roots {{go back to}} 1869 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Navy (IJN) {{established}} a naval arsenal at Yokosuka, about 13 miles south of Yokohama on Tokyo Bay. The arsenal provided ship building, repair and replenishment to <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Navy. It was also a storage depot where munitions and other assorted supplies were brought as they were purchased.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Army {{occupied}} <b>the</b> Philippines in 1941 {{they found}} an old Bantam Mk II Jeep and promptly {{sent it to}} Japan. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> military authorities ordered Toyota to make a similar vehicle but to change the appearance. The resulting Model AK prototype led to the Yon-Shiki Kogata Kamotsu-Sha (四式小型 貨物 車 type 4 compact cargo-truck).|$|R
50|$|With the Allied {{advance in}} <b>the</b> Pacific, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{realised}} that Borneo {{was likely to}} be invaded. The Borneo Defence Army was strengthened with additional units and renamed the 37th Army. Command passed to Lieutenant General Baba Masao from 26 December 1944 until 11 September 1945, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> official <b>Japanese</b> surrender was signed on board HMAS Kapunda.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, {{in early}} August, Duke of York was {{assigned}} to Task Force 37, along with four aircraft carriers and her sister-ship King George V. From 9 August, TF 37 and three American carrier task forces {{conducted a series of}} air raids on Japan, which continued until 15 August when a surrender came into effect. After the conclusion of hostilities, Duke of York, alongside her sister-ship, King George V, participated in the surrender ceremonies that took place in Tokyo Bay. The following month Duke of York sailed for Hong Kong, to join the fleet that assembled there to accept the surrender of the Japanese garrison. She was the flagship of the British Pacific Fleet <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> surrendered, and remained so until June 1946, when she returned to Plymouth for an overhaul.|$|E
5|$|One {{group of}} Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs to hear about the status of the war. A smuggled camera was used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp for the possibility of securing a handgun.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{independence}} {{over the next}} decade were interrupted by World War II <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Empire invaded and the Second Philippine Republic of José P. Laurel was established as a collaborator state. Many atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war such as the Bataan Death March and the Manila massacre that culminated with the Battle of Manila. In 1944, Quezon died in exile in the United States and Sergio Osmeña succeeded him. The Allied Forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the Philippine archipelago, in the process, retaking territory conquered by Imperial Japan.|$|E
50|$|Japanese Canadians first {{established}} Buddhism in Canada {{during the}} late 1800s as new immigrants gathered in homes. The Jodo Shinshu tradition likely resided in British Columbia as early as 1889, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first <b>Japanese</b> consulate was established.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotary engine}} had {{financial}} advantages to Japanese consumers {{in that the}} engine displacement remained below 1.5 liters, a significant determination <b>when</b> paying <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> annual road tax which kept the obligation affordable to most buyers, while having more power than the traditional inline engines.|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> all <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{planes were}} recovered, there were {{erroneous}} reports of enemy {{ships in the}} vicinity, but search planes found no ships within the area. During the search, four Nakajima E8N2 [...] "Dave" [...] two-seat reconnaissance planes—launched from the heavy cruisers [...] and —encountered U.S. fighters searching for <b>the</b> departing <b>Japanese</b> squadron.|$|R
