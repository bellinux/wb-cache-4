Bush said, [...] "Originally when I wrote the song 'The Sensual World', I had used text {{from the end}} of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E
500|$|Killebrew {{was known}} for his quick hands and {{exceptional}} upper-body strength, demonstrated by several [...] "tape measure" [...] home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E
500|$|Doby {{experienced}} many prejudices {{during his}} time before, during, and after the majors. One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him. Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field. He endured many racial slurs, from the stands and elsewhere, during games. He also received death threats. After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories of {{his days as a}} barrier-breaker. [...] "You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> bat, I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it. I felt like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name. You know most of them couldn't afford to be there. I never forgot them." ...|$|E

500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, {{following}} {{the hiring of}} former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps onto the series, Francis was let go from the soap opera due to budgetary cuts from Sony Pictures Television and CBS. Phelps had previously stated {{that there would be}} cast changes to the series due to monetary reasons. When asked specifically about reports indicating Francis' dismissal, she said: [...] "Genie and I had a wonderful talk <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Y and I think we're really quite fond of each other. She's a magnificent actress." [...] Despite confirmations that the actress' dismissal was due to budgetary reasons, Jillian Bowe of Zap2it reported a rumor that [...] "the veteran's tenure on the show wasn't well-received by the brass at CBS and Sony". Sara Bibel of Xfinity reported another rumor about her dismissal, saying it was [...] "no secret" [...] that Francis and Phelps [...] "did not get along" [...] while both worked on General Hospital, and that [...] "few are surprised that the two were not eager to work together again".|$|E
500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than I was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E

[...] I was up late one night, {{and more and more}} ideas kept coming to me, and I kept writing out several weeks of syndicate strips for the proposed newspaper strip. [...] When morning came, I had written several weeks of material, and I dashed over to Joe's place and showed it to him. (This was the story that appeared in Action Comics #1, June, 1938, the first published appearance of Superman.) [...] Of course, Joe had worked on that earlier version of Superman, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> him with this new version of it, he was immediately sold."

2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, Plunkett {{struggled}} with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. In October 2012, Plunkett signed {{to play for}} Yorkshire. He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, I believe that a fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me reach my goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
