5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people <b>without</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery.

40|$|Abstract Background: We {{examined}} {{whether the}} recent reimbursement reductions on the bone mineral density (BMD) test affected BMD testing in female Medicare beneficiaries with or <b>without</b> supplemental private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Methods: Retrospectively analyzing hospital administrative and clinical data on female Medicare beneficiaries (n= 1320), we reviewed whether participants received BMD testing before (January 2004 ?December 2006) or after (January 2007 ?December 2009) reimbursement reductions for BMD testing. After adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics, we performed Cox proportional hazard regression {{analyses of the}} BMD test including data from all study participants; we then performed separate regression analyses using data with or <b>without</b> supplemental private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Results: In those <b>without</b> supplemental private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> (n= 421), less frequent BMD testing occurred after reimbursement reductions for BMD testing (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 67, 95 % confidence intervals [CI] 0. 34 - 0. 98; p= 0. 03). By contrast, in the overall participants (n= 1320) and those with supplemental private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> (n= 899), the number of BMD tests did not change significantly after reimbursement reductions for BMD testing. Conclusions: We found a significant association between reimbursement reductions and decrease in BMD tests in female Medicare beneficiaries <b>without</b> supplemental private <b>health</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|R
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} that ending or not enforcing the individual mandate (which requires those <b>without</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> {{to pay a}} penalty) would increase the uninsured by 13 million by 2027, reducing the budget deficit by $338 billion over 10 years as subsidies fall.

Prvi del diplomskega dela vsebuje teorijo o zgodovini ustanovitve ambulante za osebe brez obveznega zdravstvenega zavarovanja (ambulante) s podrobnejšo predstavitvijo vseh vej, katere ambulanta izvaja, bodisi da pokriva področje zdravstvene oskrbe, nudenja prenočišč brezdomcem … V drugem delu je poudarek na izvajanju zdravstvene oskrbe, s predstavitvijo zdravstvenega osebja, zaposlenih in prostovoljno sodelujočih ter prostorov in opreme, ki je v ambulanti. Predstavimo vlogo medicinske sestre pri obravnavi pacienta (v fazi od sprejema do oskrbe) ter bolezenska stanja pacientov. Podan je tudi Kodeks etičnih načel Karitasa. Na podlagi statističnih podatkov, s katerimi ambulanta razpolaga in s soglasjem Nadškofije karitas Maribor, je prikazano tudi število obiskovalcev v zadnjih štirih letih (2010 - 2014) ter bolezenska stanja bolnikov (obiskovalcev) v ambulanti. Na podlagi dolgoletnega delovanja v ambulanti ter dela s pacienti smo v zaključku diplomskega dela strnili ugotovitve in mnenja o upravičenosti delovanja in obstoja takšne ambulante. The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to present the {{activity}} and demonstrate the statistics of a clinic for people <b>without</b> obligatory <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> The {{first part of the}} thesis gives a review of the theory {{of the history of the}} establishment of clinics for people <b>without</b> obligatory <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> It includes a detailed presentation of all branches that are implemented in the clinic, e. g. covering the area of health care, providing accommodation for the homeless, etc. In the second part the focus is on the implementation of health care, presenting medical staff, employees, volunteers, premises and equipment, which is available in the clinic. Not only the role of nurses during a treatment of a patient (the stage from admission to care) and medical conditions of patients, but also a code of Caritas 2 ̆ 7 ethical principles are also presented in this thesis.
