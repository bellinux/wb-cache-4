Last year we had the singing episode, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> a big mistake. But you have to try." ...|$|E

"I {{recall a}} time, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} July or August 1901 or 1902, when this plane {{was started in}} flight on the lot between Pine and Cherry Streets. The plane flew at a height of about twelve feet from the ground, I should judge, and traveled the distance to Bostwick Avenue before {{it came to the}} ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you tell}} us, my son?" [...] In {{her voice was}} in truth reproach; yet mingled with that was another note, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> pride.|$|E
60|$|Here {{is another}} set of resolutions <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> apposite to the matter in hand.|$|R
5000|$|He once commented, [...] "There is {{a certain}} sense of the church in Texas...It is more laid-back, informal, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> good." ...|$|R
30|$|They {{connect with}} the students, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} {{if they want to}} teach us. They are interested, wanting to help us (10).|$|R
60|$|Then Quilla and {{the lady}} Mira came forward and, placing their hands beneath my elbows, {{assisted}} me {{to climb out of}} that balsa, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> the strangest way that ever a shipwrecked wanderer came to land.|$|E
6000|$|The Amahagger captains did {{not seem}} pleased with this plan <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> too bold for their fancy, and began to murmur together. Seeing that I must assert my {{authority}} at once, I walked {{up to them and}} said to their chief man, ...|$|E
60|$|For my own part, when I {{consider}} the temper of particular persons, and by what maxims they have acted (almost without exception) {{in their private}} capacities, I cannot conceive how such a bill should obtain a majority, unless every man expected {{to be one of}} the fifty, <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> the limitation intended.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Clemens {{must put}} in a late picture of Susie--a picture which she {{maintains}} <b>is</b> good, but <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> slander on the child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meaning that I {{only wish}} to {{expedite}} a business <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> unpleasant to you, but <b>which</b> <b>I</b> {{believe you have}} undertaken from unselfish devotion." ...|$|R
30|$|English text: At {{the conference}} on {{propaganda}} it was proposed that Party schools be separated from this training, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the correct thing to do.|$|R
60|$|Fifanti's mule, I {{have since}} reflected, was {{tethered}} near the steps. I saw the beast, but it conveyed no meaning to my mind, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> numbed. I sped past it and on, through the gate, round {{the road by}} the Po, under {{the walls of the}} city, and so away into the open country.|$|E
6000|$|Frank Dawson {{had come}} to Fairview {{a little over two}} years before, and had speedily made himself a prime favorite. As we have seen, he loved to exaggerate when telling things, yet with it all Whopper, so called, was as truthful as anybody. As Snap said, [...] "you could always tell Whopper's whoppers a mile off," [...] <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} of a whopper in itself, don't you? ...|$|E
60|$|The Boer leaders had, {{it must be}} remembered, acquiesced in the {{principle}} of such a separation in the preliminary peace signed by Sir Evelyn Wood and themselves. The majority of the Commission, however (Sir Evelyn Wood dissenting), finally decided against the retention of either of these districts, a decision <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> a wise one, though I arrive at that conclusion on very different grounds to those adopted {{by the majority of}} the Commission.|$|E
60|$|I am not {{in favour}} of long engagements. They give people the {{opportunity}} of finding out each other's character before marriage, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> never advisable.|$|R
5000|$|... “What I {{thought was}} {{remarkable}} is that it felt actually seductive and not just overtly sexy, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a fine line,” noted Vanity Fair’s Jessica Diehl.|$|R
40|$|This paper reconstructs {{and then}} criticizes Etchmendy's main {{arguments}} step by step. I {{will try to}} separate those parts of Etchemendy's arguments <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> wrong from those <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> correct. Finally <b>I</b> will propose a solution to Etchemendy's most basic challenge [...] the distinction of logical from nonlogical terms [...] and will argue that given this distinction, Tarski's definition withstands Etchemendy's critique, provided the usual understanding of quantifiers is modified. An interesting consequence of this modified understanding will be that not classical but free logic is the 'proper' first order logic...|$|R
60|$|Our honeymoon, {{which had}} taken place not very long before, had been {{somewhat}} curtailed, so we decided we would invite nobody, but have the yacht to ourselves. And thankful I am to Heaven that we did so decide. On Monday we put on all our clothes and started. I forget what Ethelbertha wore, but, whatever it may have been, it looked very fetching. My own costume was a dark blue trimmed with a narrow white braid, <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> rather effective.|$|E
60|$|When {{she went}} out of the room with Miss Murdstone (no other ladies were of the party), I fell into a reverie, only {{disturbed}} by the cruel apprehension that Miss Murdstone would disparage me to her. The amiable creature with the polished head told me a long story, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> about gardening. I think I heard him say, 'my gardener', several times. I seemed to pay the deepest attention to him, but I was wandering in a garden of Eden all the while, with Dora.|$|E
60|$|After this Virginia {{went to the}} Judge's bedside every day, in the morning, when Clarence {{took his}} sleep. She read his {{newspapers}} {{to him when he}} was well enough. She read the detested Missouri Democrat, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with. To have her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than she could bear. Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung the paper out of the window, and left the room. He called her back penitently.|$|E
6000|$|... "You should {{search the}} Scriptures, Bickley," [...] I broke in, [...] "and {{cultivate}} accuracy. It was fig-leaves that symbolised its arrival. The garments, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>were</b> of skin, developed later." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Bracknell. To speak frankly, I am not {{in favour}} of long engagements. They give people the {{opportunity}} of finding out each other's character before marriage, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> never advisable.|$|R
5000|$|... "Mac Fall (MacPhail and MacPhoil) <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> of Scottish origin. O'Mulfoyle {{is listed}} in the 1659 'census' as a {{principal}} Irish surname in the barony of Tirkeerran, which is contiguous to Inishown." ...|$|R
60|$|The phaeton {{was a very}} {{handsome}} affair; the horses arched their necks and lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors' Commons. There {{was a good deal}} of competition in the Commons on all points of display, and it turned out some very choice equipages then; though I always have considered, and always shall consider, that in my time the great article of competition there was starch: <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> worn among the proctors to as great an extent {{as it is in the}} nature of man to bear.|$|E
60|$|This {{incident}} {{reminds me}} of a young girl--a pale, slender, feeble creature most unlike the other rosy and healthful damsels of the Vineyard, amid whose brightness she was fading away. Day after day did the poor maiden come to the sculptor's shop and pass from one piece of marble to another, till at last she pencilled her name upon a slender slab <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> of a more spotless white than all the rest. I saw her no more, but soon afterward found Mr. Wigglesworth cutting her virgin-name into the stone which she had chosen.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} foolish," [...] Leigh said. [...] "It is funny what foolish ideas women have. You {{could not have}} {{foreseen}} what was coming, when you came over here; and you {{thought that it would}} be a good thing for me to accompany you, for a time. You did what you thought was best, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> best. Well, if it doesn't turn out just what we expected, you cannot blame yourself for that. Why, if you were to ask me to come for a walk, and a tree fell on me as we were going along and killed me, you would hardly blame yourself because you asked me to come; and this is just the same.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Poole's Annotations has the {{following}} remarks on these lines; <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> {{so much to}} that part of my case which is to follow, that I do not omit them. The words are these:-- ...|$|R
60|$|We {{use such}} in England {{with the last}} contempt, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a strange error, since though they are useless to the commonwealth, they are only so by God's direct providence, and no {{previous}} fault.|$|R
60|$|As {{the reader}} may, perhaps, {{have been asking}} a few {{questions}} about the whale in his own mind, I shall try to answer them, by telling a few things concerning that creature <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> worth knowing.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, that's enough," [...] she urged, by {{an effort}} of will {{withdrawing}} {{herself from the}} fascination of his strength. [...] "I have talked with father and mother. I never before asserted myself so against them. I demanded to be heard. I was very undutiful. They are against you, you know; but I assured {{them over and over}} of my abiding love for you, and at last father agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away in his office. And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you enough at the start so that we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere. <b>Which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> very fine of him--don't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Before I {{proceed in}} the history of the married part of my life, you must allow me to give as {{impartial}} an account of my husband as I have done of myself. He was a jolly, handsome fellow, as any woman need wish for a companion; tall and well made; rather a little too large, but not so as to be ungenteel; he danced well, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> the first thing that brought us together. He had an old father who managed the business carefully, so that he had little of that part lay on him, but now and then to appear and show himself; and he took the advantage of it, for he troubled himself very little about it, but went abroad, kept company, hunted much, and loved it exceedingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not easy}} to exaggerate the {{importance}} of the information [...] imparted by certain branches of science; it modifies the [...] whole criticism of life made in maturer years. The study has [...] often, on a mass of boys, a certain influence <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> [...] hardly anticipated, and to which a good deal of value must be [...] attached--an influence as much moral as intellectual, which is [...] shown in the increased and increasing respect for precision of [...] statement, and for that form of veracity which consists in the [...] acknowledgment of difficulties. It produces a real effect to find [...] that Nature cannot be imposed upon, and the attention given [...] to experimental lectures, at first superficial and curious only, [...] soon becomes minute, serious, and practical." ...|$|E
5000|$|Redmayne heaped praise on {{the novel}} and the {{character}} of Tess, acknowledging that [...] "Hardy had the boldness to create a character with great strength at that time, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> what makes her so enduring and relevant today".|$|R
5000|$|... "When El Paso Wrecking Corp. {{first opened}} it caused big shock waves all across gay America, {{but since then}} it's picked up as easily as fashion, wear your jackets and chains. It's macho-ed up gay America <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a good thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor made {{a sign of}} impatience. [...] "Well," [...] he said [...] "you {{have told}} me, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> as far as your concern in the matter goes. I may add that I'm not {{accustomed}} to dictation {{on behalf of a}} steerage passenger." ...|$|R
