5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Even if the Huskies {{were still}} a strong {{national}} contender, {{they were no longer}} viewed as a favorite to <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East Tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year.|$|E
25|$|The Panthers {{became the}} first No. 3 seed {{to advance to the}} Super Bowl since the league {{expanded}} to a 12-team playoff format in 1990. In doing so, they were also the first division winner to advance to the league championship after playing three playoff games. All other instances up to this point where teams advanced to the Super Bowl after playing all three rounds of the playoffs were wild card teams in Super Bowls XV, XX, XXVII, XXXII, XXXIV, and XXXV. Prior to Super Bowl XVII, the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins both won three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl, but that came during the strike-shortened 1982 season when the regular season was reduced to nine games and the playoffs were expanded to 16 teams, with no teams receiving first-round byes. Since then, there have been six instances of teams advancing to the Super Bowl after playing three playoff games: the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XL as the No. 6 seeded team, the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLI as the No. 3 seed, the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII as the No. 5 seed, the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII as the No. 4 seed, the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV as the No. 6 seed, and again the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI as the No. 4 seed. The Colts, Cardinals, and the Giants in 2011, like the Panthers, were division winners in those years (Although in the Colts case, they played the No. 4 seeded New England Patriots in the AFC Championship that year, ensuring at least the second division winner to play three rounds {{to make it to the}} Super Bowl.), and all but the Cardinals went on to <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> The Super Bowl would mark the third game (out of four) of the playoffs in which Carolina scored 29 points.|$|E

2500|$|The Lakers in 1985 {{won their}} first {{championship}} in nine meetings against the Boston Celtics, and again defeated their rivals {{for the title}} in 1987. At the championship celebrations following the 1987 Finals, coach Riley boldly guaranteed before the cheering crowd that the Lakers would <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> again in 1988. This was a very bold gesture as the league {{had not had a}} repeat champion for nearly 20 years. [...] Nevertheless, this guarantee was fulfilled as the Los Angeles Lakers repeated as champions in 1988, becoming the first NBA team to capture back-to-back championships since the Celtics' repeat title in 1968–69 in legendary center Bill Russell's last season. With the team older, the Lakers were more of a half-court team that season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Jackson {{and his new}} teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's {{version of the story}} is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more to <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be [...] "the straw that stirs the drink." [...] But when the story appeared in the June 1977 issue of SPORT, Ward quoted Jackson as saying, [...] "This team, it all flows from me. I'm the straw that stirs the drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cavaliers won 45 {{games in}} the 2007–08 season, despite early-season {{contract}} issues involving center Anderson Varejão and guard Sasha Pavlović, and a mid-season trade for Ben Wallace. They fell {{in the second round}} to the eventual NBA champions Boston Celtics in seven games, after a hard-fought duel involving LeBron James and Paul Pierce. The Cavaliers would earn the league's best record {{for the next two years}} (66 and 61 wins, respectively) and boast the NBA's MVP in James. However, they were unable to <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> losing to the Orlando Magic in six games of the 2009 Eastern Conference Finals and the Celtics in six games of the 2010 Eastern Conference Semifinals (allowing the Lakers to win the Finals twice against the Magic and Celtics). The latter playoff defeat would cost head coach Mike Brown his job, though he was later re-hired (and fired again) in the 2013–14 NBA season. After that season, as a free agent, James left for the Miami Heat and helped them to four successive NBA Finals appearances, winning in [...] and 2013, while the Cavaliers sunk to an Eastern Conference-low 19 wins in the 2010–11 NBA season, which included a 26-game losing streak.|$|E

But I do not ask you to say it, and beware how you tell me a lie. I leave you, Teule, but before I go I will say that I honour you more in this hour than I have honoured you before, because you have dared to speak the truth to me, Montezuma's daughter, when a lie had been so easy and so safe. That woman beyond the seas should be grateful to you, but though I bear her no ill will, between me and her there is a struggle to the death. We are strangers to each other, and strangers we shall remain, but she has touched your hand as I touch it now; you link us together and are our bond of enmity. Farewell my husband that is to be. We shall meet no more till that sorry day when a [...] "slut" [...] shall be given to a [...] "felon" [...] in marriage. I use your own words, Teule!' ...|$|E
