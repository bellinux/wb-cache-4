The narrow interorbital region, located between the eyes, converges towards the front and is flanked by low beads.

5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice as <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E
5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E

5|$|Briscoe {{passed the}} Chip Ganassi Racing drivers {{after they were}} held up by slower cars to move into second place on lap 29. Green-flag pit stops began four laps later. Wilson spun {{at the end of}} the backstretch while braking for turn ten on the 36th lap after his right-rear shock {{absorber}} failed and drove slowly to his pit box to repair damage to his vehicle. Danica Patrick attempted to pass Baugette around the inside on lap 39, but lost control of her car and ran wide into the infield grass section and rejoined the track in 17th without damaging to her suspension. Andretti's front wing came apart on lap 46 while holding up four cars, and Scheckter ran <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> four cars passed Andretti. The first full course caution of the event was necessitated on the following lap when Alex Lloyd spun into the grass and stalled his engine. Andretti made a pit stop for a replacement front wing during the caution. Racing resumed at the start of lap 51 with Power leading Castroneves, Briscoe and Dixon. Shortly afterward, de Silvestro was hit from behind by Viso who overheated his brakes, and went into the turn one tyre barrier, causing the second caution. Viso avoided making contact with teammate Tracy (who took avoiding action) on the same lap.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces {{had already}} {{commenced}} work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, {{then on the}} drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not as <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time {{there were only two}} sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, with an apparent (visual) magnitude of 3.14. It is an orange giant of spectral type K7III located 203 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth. Around twice as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted the hydrogen {{at its core}} and has evolved away from the main sequence. The star has swollen to about 55 times the Sun's radius and is emitting roughly 673 times the luminosity of the Sun. The stellar atmosphere has cooled, giving it a surface temperature of 3,880K., see Table 1. The only star with a proper name is Alsciaukat (from the Arabic for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, located 380 ± 10 light-years from Earth. This star is also an evolved giant with around twice the Sun's mass that has swollen and cooled since exhausting its core hydrogen. It is anywhere from 59 to 75 times as <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Sun, and 740 times as luminous. Alsciaukat is also a variable star, ranging in brightness by 0.05 magnitude over 25 to 30 days from its baseline magnitude of 4.25.|$|E

25|$|In the {{electron}} gun, monochromatic electrons are emitted by a cathode filament {{which is at}} a negative potential, typically 10-600 V, {{with respect to the}} sample. The electrons are accelerated and focused into a beam, typically about 0.1 to 0.5mm wide, by a series of electrodes serving as electron lenses. Some of {{the electron}}s incident on the sample surface are backscattered elastically, and diffraction can be detected if sufficient order exists on the surface. This typically requires a region of single crystal surface as <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> electron beam, although sometimes polycrystalline surfaces such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) are sufficient.|$|E
