The handheld tools for scraping and cutting were no longer sought after, for tools with shapes that fit the hand {{seemed to be the}} upcoming trend. Starting about 1.6 million years ago, this new technology evolution emerged, known as the Acheulean tradition. Tools classified under this category are known as the earliest indicators of hand axe usage. The biggest difference from the early oldowan tools, or choppers, is the fact that two sides have had <b>flakes</b> <b>chipped</b> off, versus the single side of the chopper.|$|R
50|$|There were 70 {{thin and}} bifacially worked blades, {{which had no}} cutting edges nor notches and stems.

Only two presented special preparation for hafting. 2 spokeshaves and 21 drills were also found.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{and lowest}} deposits {{in the cave}} contain large amounts of sea sand. This, and pollen traces found, suggests a relatively warm climate at the time. The melting glaciers which covered {{large parts of the}} globe caused the sea level to rise and the Mediterranean coastline to recede. The Coastal Plain was then narrower than it is today, and was covered with savannah vegetation. The cave dwellers of that time used handaxes of flint or limestone for killing animals (gazelle, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and wild cattle which roamed the Coastal Plain) and for digging out plant roots. As tools improved slowly over time, the hand axes became smaller and better shaped, and scrapers made of thick <b>flakes</b> <b>chipped</b> off flint cores were probably used for scraping meat off bones and for processing animal skins.|$|R

5000|$|Ramah Bay is {{the site}} of an {{uncommon}} semi-translucent light-grey stone with dark banding called [...] "Ramah chert". The Ramah chert outcrops in a narrow geological bed stretching from Saglek Fiord to Nachvak. At Ramah Bay the highest quality stone, for <b>flaking</b> <b>chipped</b> stone tools (mostly bifaces and projectile points), is most readily accessible. Discovered by pioneering Native American groups, which archaeologists identify as the Maritime Archaic Culture, around 7000 years ago, the stone was highly valued for its functional as well as spiritual qualities. Ramah chert was the preferred raw material for the Maritime Archaic Indians (ca. 7000 to 3500 years ago) and for succeeding populations of Dorset paleoeskimos (ca. 2200 to 800 years ago) and by the immediate ancestors of the Innu (from about 2000 years ago to contact with the Europeans in the 18th century). Ramahchert was traded as far south as New England and even Chesapeake Bay and west to the Great Lakes which is documented in a report by Stephen Loring.|$|R

25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as <b>flakes</b> and <b>chips,</b> effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|R

30|$|The {{fabrication}} {{process of the}} presented graphene nano-device {{is based on the}} mechanical exfoliation of (natural) graphite by adhesive tapes [24, 25, 28]. The substrate material consists of highly doped silicon (Si++) bulk material covered with 295 nm of silicon oxide (SiO 2), where thickness (and roughness) of the SiO 2 top layer is crucial for the Raman [38] and scanning force microscope based identification of single-layer graphene flakes. Standard photolithography followed by metallization and liftoff is used to pattern arrays of reference alignment markers on the substrate which are later used to re-identify the locations of individual graphene <b>flakes</b> on the <b>chip</b> and to align further processing patterns. The graphene flakes are structured to submicron dimensions by electron beam lithography (EBL) and reactive ion etching based techniques to fulfill the nanodevice design requirement. After etching and removing the residual resist, the graphene nanostructures are contacted by an additional EBL step, followed by metallization and lift-off.|$|R
40|$|Teeth wear for {{a number}} of reasons. One of the causes for wear is the use of {{abrasive}} tooth pastes. A study is reported in which enamel was damaged by single pass sliding of a diamond indenter. In single crystals of fluorapatite, wear occurs by <b>flaking</b> out of <b>chips</b> of material and severely fractured substrate is left behind. On the other hand teeth are made of small rods of polycrystalline hydroxyapatite of the order of 5 [mu]m in diameter oriented perpendicular to the tooth surface. This rod structure of human teeth prevents large scale flaking out of material. Apparently the subsurface cracks do not extend from one rod to the other so that subsequent passes do not result in severe wear. Small abrasive particles may do considerable damage to rods, but the overall effect is small. Large abrasive particles with high loads cause separation of rods, and cracks appear to propagate but without severe permanent damage...|$|R
