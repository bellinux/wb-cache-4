5|$|Most of the {{population}} live in poverty, occupied in farming or raising livestock. Some have moved to the cities to seek {{a higher standard of}} living, returning to help during the peak periods of agricultural activity. Infrastructure is underdeveloped; there is no electricity supply, most <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from traditional wells, and the rudimentary school system provides only elementary education in poorly equipped establishments.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E
5|$|One of many {{exceptions}} to Seattle's {{reputation as a}} damp location occurs in El Niño years, when marine weather systems track {{as far south as}} California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area. Since the region's <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months, El Niño winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of <b>water,</b> <b>comes</b> into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E

25|$|Wellington's first {{piped water}} supply came from a spring in 1867. Greater Wellington Regional Council now {{supplies}} Lower Hutt, Porirua, Upper Hutt and Wellington with up to 220 million litres a day. The <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from Wainuiomata River (since 1884), Hutt River (1914), Orongorongo River (1926) and the Lower Hutt aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Feed <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> {{in through}} the {{economizer}} and then exits after having attained saturation temp in the water or steam circuit. Finally it then flows through evaporator and super heater. If {{the temperature of the}} gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher, then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{tributary}} forks of Boeing Creek. The northern fork emerges from a culvert in Boeing Creek Park. Its <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from drainage pipes beneath 6th Avenue. This fork joins the main stem in Boeing Creek Park. Another tributary fork rises in the neighborhoods of Shoreview Hills and The Highlands and flows north to join Boeing Creek below Hidden Lake.|$|E

25|$|This center, {{despite being}} in the {{urbanized}} zone, still retains much of its provincial atmosphere with colonial era mansions and cobblestone streets. Much of the borough’s importance stems from its forested conservation areas, as it functions to provide oxygen to the Valley of Mexico and serves for aquifer recharge. Seventy percent of Mexico City’s <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from wells in this borough.|$|E
25|$|Launceston's <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> {{from the}} Launceston Water Catchment. The {{majority}} is sourced from St Patricks River, {{a tributary of}} the North Esk River which flows through Launceston. The main retailer is Ben Lomond Water. The first reticulated water supply constructed in 1857 still serves the CBD. There were fears that the Tamar Valley Pulp Mill might adversely affect Launceston's water supply.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan {{operates}} its own {{water and}} wastewater treatment systems, both built in 1949. Drinking <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from the South Yamhill River and from springs on Stony Mountain to the north. Sheridan has two city parks, Sheridan City Park that includes a skatepark, and South Park along Oregon Route 18 that features a fishing pond. Additionally, there is the J. A. Art Hebert Memorial Plaza on Bridge Street near the river.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, {{approximately}} 70 {{per cent}} of drinking <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from surface water and 30 per cent from groundwater. In 2004, water supply systems {{had a total}} capacity of 90 million cubic metres a day. The average residential water use was 248 litres per capita per day. One fourth of the world's fresh surface and groundwater is located in Russia. The water utilities sector {{is one of the}} largest industries in Russia serving the entire Russian population.|$|E
25|$|Human {{activities}} {{are more likely}} to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.|$|E

25|$|Águas de São Pedro {{is popular}} for its mineral waters, {{as its name}} indicates. There are three fountains in the municipality: Fonte Juventude (Youth Fountain), Fonte Gioconda (Gioconda Fountain), and Fonte Almeida Salles (Almeida Salles Fountain), all with a much higher {{mineralization}} than most other Brazilian mineral springs. Of these three, only the last two have a natural outcrop, as the Juventude fountain <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from the artesian well at an old oil exploration site. The water in the Fontanário Municipal (Municipal Fountain) is potable, and for baths, there is the Spa Thermal Dr. Octavio Moura Andrade, the municipal bath house.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} levels of treatment, and many {{different}} ways of treating the water—which leads to a big difference in the quality of the end product. The best quality of reclaimed sewage <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from adding a gravitational filtering step, after the chemical and biological cleansing. This method uses small ponds in which the water seeps through the sand into the aquifer in about 400 days, then is pumped out as clear purified water. This is nearly the same process used in the space station water recycling system, which turns urine and feces into purified drinking water, oxygen and manure.|$|E
25|$|To {{regulate}} {{the flow of}} water {{into and out of the}} wetlands, the parks department adds or removes boards at a small dam near the railroad berm. The idea is to replicate conditions that existed when the wetlands were fully connected to the river. Part of the water in the wetlands comes from natural springs, and part of the <b>water</b> <b>comes</b> from the river, when it runs high in the winter. Beavers have at times foiled the plan by damming the small stream that carries water between the lake and the river. The parks department has foiled the rodents by running a perforated pipe through the beaver dam.|$|E
