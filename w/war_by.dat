5|$|After the Iraqi {{forces were}} defeated, the U.N. {{mandated}} that the U.S. withdraw from Iraq, ending the Gulf <b>War.</b> <b>By</b> {{the end of}} combat operations, the 24th Infantry Division advanced 260 miles and destroyed 360 tanks and other armored personnel carriers, 300 artillery pieces, 1,200 trucks, 25 aircraft, 19 missiles, and over 500 pieces of engineer equipment. The division took over 5,000 Iraqi prisoners of war while suffering only eight killed, 36 wounded, and five non-combat casualties.|$|E
5|$|As {{production}} of F-105s had ended, the type was replaced in the Vietnam <b>War</b> <b>by</b> other aircraft, primarily the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. In October 1970, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Takhli RTAFB, Thailand, the last F-105D unit in Southeast Asia, began {{to return to}} the U.S. The F-105G Wild Weasel versions soldiered on {{until the end of the}} war.

5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus {{inventories}} of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the <b>war</b> <b>by</b> the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best. The company decided to focus instead on heavy construction equipment and sought {{to capitalize on the}} passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden with debt and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the <b>war</b> <b>by</b> Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{administration}} was dominated in the 1760s and 1770s by Warren Hastings, {{the first man}} to hold the title of Governor-General. The military arm of the East India Company was directed during the Seven Years' War and the Second Anglo-Mysore <b>War</b> <b>by</b> General Eyre Coote, who died in 1783 during the later stages of the war with Mysore. Company policy, as implemented by Hastings, had involved the company in intrigues and shifting alliances involving France, Mysore, the Marathas, and factions within those and other local territories.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1918, the German Army {{had been}} fought to a {{standstill}} after its Spring Offensive and the Allies had sought to take the initiative. Accordingly, the Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August, with an attack on Amiens which {{marked the beginning of}} a series of advances by the Allies that ultimately ended the <b>war.</b> <b>By</b> late October, the New Zealand Division, commanded by Major General Andrew Russell, along with part of the British Third Army, had advanced {{to the west of the}} town of Le Quesnoy.|$|E
5|$|During 1936, the Arab Revolt {{broke out}} in the British Mandate of Palestine. British troops were dispatched, ending {{the first phase of the}} <b>war</b> <b>by</b> the close of the year. Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With rising {{tensions}} in Europe, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement—on 30September 1938—calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Fort Sill was {{established}} in 1869 after the American Civil <b>War</b> <b>by</b> Major General Philip Sheridan, who was leading a campaign in the Indian Territory to stop raids into Texas by American Indian tribes. In 1874, the Red River War {{broke out in the}} region when the Comanche, Kiowa, and Southern Cheyenne left their Indian Territory reservation. Attrition and skirmishes by the US Army finally forced the return of the tribes back to Indian Territory in June 1875.|$|E

5|$|Herschel's {{proposed}} {{name was}} not popular outside Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed {{that it be}} named Herschel in honour of its discoverer. Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the name Neptune, which was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet {{in the course of}} the American Revolutionary <b>War</b> <b>by</b> calling the new planet even Neptune George III or Neptune Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 361, however, Julian {{decided to}} confront Constantius {{and the two}} {{emperors}} marched against each other to settle the issue. But the empire was spared another civil <b>war</b> <b>by</b> the senior emperor's sudden death in Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|In September 1899, it {{was clear}} that the crisis in South Africa was likely to turn into <b>war.</b> <b>By</b> 2 October, all {{military}} leave had been cancelled, and urgent preparations were under way to send a large expeditionary force to the Cape, with horses and supplies being requisitioned and mobilised. On 7 October, a proclamation was issued calling out the Army Reserve. Of 65,000 liable men, around 25,000 were intended to be called up for service. The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October.|$|E
5|$|In early May 1917, the 12th Battalion was {{involved}} in the British and Australian attempt to capture the village of Bullecourt. While engaged in this operation on 6 May, Newland was wounded for the third and final time of the <b>war</b> <b>by</b> a gunshot to his left armpit. Initially admitted to the 5th Field Ambulance, he was transferred to No 1 Red Cross Hospital, Le Touquet, the next day. The injury necessitated treatment in England, and Newland was shipped to a British hospital eight days later.|$|E
5|$|In {{many other}} neighborhoods, the City had renewed and thus gentrified areas without public hearings, because {{residents}} of those neighborhoods were low-income renters. In Milwaukee Avenue's case, however, the residents were of medium income, and seasoned protesters, since many had protested the Vietnam <b>War.</b> <b>By</b> 1970, the City of Minneapolis planned to raze the Milwaukee Avenue houses using {{funds from the}} Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program.|$|E
