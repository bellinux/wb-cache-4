40|$|Abstract- In {{the present}} work an {{investigation}} {{was made on}} property relationship of SS 304 L austenitic stainless steel <b>welds.</b> <b>Shielded</b> metal arc <b>welding</b> (SMAW), {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) methods were used to make welds. Tensile test was used to measure the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the welds. Impact test was used to measure the toughness of the welds. Experimental results clearly revealed that these properties of GTAW was superior compared to the other two welds. This was due to more weld penetration at lower heat input into the base metal. The disadvantage of SMAW and GMAW is that the slag must be chipped off of the weld after it cools and can sometimes infiltrate the weld causing weakness.

As Argon is an inert gas it doesnot have {{influence on the}} microstructure of the weld material or on the heat input of the weld,whereas nitrogen has solubility to austenite.

This has been detected when comparing the hardnessprofiles of nitrogen <b>shielded</b> <b>welds</b> of austenitic stainless steel with Argon <b>shielded</b> <b>welds.</b> Nitrogen as the shielding gas can compensate the softer structure of the weld in workhardenedand nitrogen-alloyed steels.

50|$|Modern forge-welding {{is often}} automated, using computers, machines, and {{sophisticated}} hydraulic-presses {{to produce a}} variety of products {{from a number of}} various alloys. For example, steel pipe is often forge-welded during the manufacturing process. Flat stock is heated and fed through specially-shaped rollers that both form the steel into a tube and simultaneously provide the pressure to weld the edges into a continuous seam. Diffusion bonding is a common method for forge welding titanium alloys in the aerospace industry. In this process the metal is heated while in a press or die. Beyond a specific critical-temperature, which varies depending on the alloy, the impurities burn out and the surfaces are forced together. Other methods include flash welding and percussion welding. These are resistance forge-welding techniques where the press or die is electrified, passing high current through the alloy to create the heat for the <b>weld.</b> <b>Shielded</b> active-gas forge-welding is a process of forge welding in an oxygen-reactive environment, to burn out oxides, using hydrogen gas and induction heating.|$|R
