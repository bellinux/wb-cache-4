25|$|Theories {{also help}} place {{events in a}} causal context that is greater than common sense alone can provide, because commonsense {{causation}} is inherently limited by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> and experience. Theoretical formulations are therefore used as intermediaries to link natural effects to natural causes.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> as a cratonic margin today were created by the action of a plume event initiating a continental rifting episode; therefore the tectonic setting of most large layered complexes must be carefully weighed in terms of geochemistry {{and the nature of the}} host sequence, and in some cases a mixed mechanism cause is possible.|$|E

25|$|The message I {{would give}} to Aikidoka {{in general is}} that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today is not, in my humble opinion, the Aikido of the founder. It has become so many other things. So many complications, {{additions}} and unnecessary requirements hide the essential nature of the art. However, those who seek shall find, {{and if they are}} able to step outside of the box and dispassionately explore, they may discover a very simple magical secret!".|$|E
25|$|Most locks have a bypass flume, {{which allows}} water {{to bypass the}} lock to water the level below. If the flume was covered over with concrete, that {{generally}} meant that a roadway passed over the lock. Originally the locks 1-27, {{with the possible exception}} of Lock 13 did not have bypass flumes, using the culverts to divert water, but later the bypass flumes were put in (which is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today).|$|E
25|$|The close {{connection}} between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs {{is at the root}} of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient conceives the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first mounted fox hunts were {{described}} by Sir Walter Scott, who also described the first working terriers in the UK. The first true breed of working terrier that bears a resemblance to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> {{in the field}} today is the Jack Russell Terrier. The Jack Russell Terrier is named after the Reverend John Russell, whose long life (1795–1883) encompasses the entire early history of mounted fox hunts in the UK and who is credited with breeding the first fox-working white-bodied terrier used in the field today.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, {{and then there is}} the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> and hear.|$|E
25|$|Third, Searle {{argues that}} much of {{rational}} deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, {{not the other way}} around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and our system of rules derives from finding patterns in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> as rational.|$|E

25|$|A {{document}} that Howard Colvin found at Worcester College library in Oxford in the 1960s confirmed not only de Caus as the architect, {{but that the}} original plan for the south facade {{was to have been}} over twice the length of that built; <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today was intended to be only one of two identical wings linked by a central portico of six Corinthian columns. The whole was to be enhanced by a great parterre whose dimensions were 1,000 feet by 400 feet. This parterre was in fact created and remained in existence for over 100 years. The second wing however failed to materialise – perhaps because of the 4th Earl's quarrel with King Charles I and subsequent fall from favour, or the outbreak of the Civil War; or simply lack of finances.|$|E
500|$|Conran {{acknowledged}} {{his debt}} to German Expressionism, which was particularly {{evident in the}} opening scenes in New York City: [...] "Early German cinema was born of just a completely different aesthetic than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> nowadays. One of the last things I watched before starting this project was the Dr. Mabuse series that Lang had done - terribly inspirational, the use of art and propaganda even." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the story, Spears stated, [...] "The best part {{for me as}} a writer was to show some events from the movie from a different point of view, sort of like Rashomon for you Kurosawa fans. And with comics we can get into the character's heads in a way that works well in comics and novels more so than in film." [...] He stated, [...] "...I was using the medium to change what we really know about these characters and twist around <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> in the movies. All the academics aside, it's also very funny and gore splattered." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{articulate}} and defend a new imperative, Auschwitz survivor Charlotte Delbo’s Il faut donner à voir: “They must be made to see. ” Assuming the ‘they’ in Delbo’s imperative is ‘us’ gives rise to three questions: (1) <b>what</b> must <b>we</b> <b>see?</b> (2) can <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it? and (3) why is it that we must? I maintain that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> must <b>see</b> is the reality of evil; that we are by and large unwilling, and often unable, to see the reality of evil; and that {{if there is to be}} comprehension of—to say nothing of justice for—the survivors of evil, we nonetheless must...|$|R

500|$|Skyler Miller, a {{reviewer}} at Allgame who {{compared the}} console {{adaptation to the}} original game, admitted that the graphics are [...] "recognizable," [...] but claims that the version is [...] "missing much of the original's detail and character." [...] Miller's final judgment is to call it [...] "a passable effort" [...] and to compare unfavourably to the arcade version. Edward J. Semrad, a contemporary technical writer and computer specialist with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel included the game in his list of games that were [...] "watered-down versions of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> in the arcades" [...] and praised the PC version for its superiority.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] (season nine, 1997), an [...] "angel skeleton" [...] is discovered, {{much to the}} {{skepticism}} of Lisa. As Lisa rants {{about the people who}} believe it is an angel, Marge informs her that she also believes it is an angel. She tells Lisa, [...] "There has to be more life than just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see,</b> everyone needs something to believe in." [...] In spite of her highly debatable moral stances, Marge struggles with vices, such as a gambling addiction. While Marge has learned to cope with her addiction, it has never completely disappeared and remains an underlying problem that is referenced occasionally on the show.|$|E
500|$|Besides directing, Leni was {{a painter}} and set designer. The sets of the film were {{designed}} by Leni and fabricated by Charles D. Hall, who later designed the sets of Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931). Leni hoped to eschew realism for visual designs that reflected the emotions of characters. He wrote, [...] "It is not extreme reality that the camera perceives, but {{the reality of the}} inner event, which is more profound, effective and moving than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> through everyday eyes ...." [...] Leni went on to direct the Charlie Chan film The Chinese Parrot (1927), The Man Who Laughs (1928), and The Last Warning (1929) before his death in 1929 from blood poisoning.|$|E

500|$|In the UK, The Rape Crisis Centre, an {{organization}} that helps victims of sexual abuse and sexual violence, criticized the video. Eileen Kelly, {{a representative of the}} group, stated that the video sends [...] "out an inappropriate message" [...] and told The Daily Star that the clip [...] "is a disgrace. It sends the message that she is an object to be possessed by men, which is disturbingly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> in real violence cases". The video was also criticized by Brandon Ward, a youth pastor of Oasis Christian Center in Staten Island, New York, for [...] "damaging the moral and self-worth of young impressionable teens." [...] Ward wrote how he thought the video affects females' sense of self-worth: ...|$|E
500|$|Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "a queasy glimpse into bargain-basement sleaze." [...] DVD Talk critic Adam Tyner was {{indifferent}} {{about the film}} while watching it, but later concluded that the film is [...] "pretty brilliant". Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict thought that the film is ambitious and offers [...] "interesting insights into the modern consumption of horror." [...] Joe Leydon of Variety described the film as an [...] "uncomfortably close look at underground horror", and speculated that it may gain a cult following. David Harley of Bloody Disgusting called S a [...] "must-watch" [...] for anyone that has been scared while watching a horror film {{without being able to}} describe why. In response to the film, Richard Corliss of Time questioned whether we can always believe <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
500|$|Positions on genetic {{determinism}} often {{correlate with}} social politics, and {{few of us}} are neutral or even changeable on the issues. Wade recognizes that his ideas may not be acceptable to everyone but warns that [...] "to falter in scientific inquiry would be a retreat into darkness". He seems to be warning, appropriately enough, against benighted political correctness. But we should never become casual about how comparable [...] "slopular" [...] science and very similar speculative evolutionary reasoning by leading scientists fed a venomous kind of darkness not too many decades ago. Wade's post-hoc tales often put him in step with a long march of social darwinists who, with comfortable detachment from the (currently) dominant culture, insist that we look starkly at life in the raw and not blink at <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
