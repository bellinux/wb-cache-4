40|$|Flat {{projection}} displays promise {{the convenience}} of a flat panel with the low manufacturing costs of projection. The displays {{can be made by}} pointing a video projector into the thick end of a wedge-shaped piece of glass or acrylic, but {{it is important that the}} projected image be undistorted. It is shown here that paraxial <b>wedge</b> <b>projection</b> is linear, so that the projection lens can be designed using conventional lens shapes and combinations. 1...|$|E

The irregularity in the border was created c. 1881 when Queen Victoria gave Mount Kilimanjaro away as a wedding present to her grandson, then Crown Prince of Prussia and later Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. Subsequently, the border was adjusted so that Kilimanjaro would fall within the boundaries of German East Africa instead of the British East Africa Protectorate.|$|R
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{daunting}} challenge {{the next generation}} of Americans will face is what President Bush called our "addiction to oil". The challenge is to find the means to provide for our transportation needs in the face of declining world oil production. Perhaps the central question is whether we will export the great wealth of America to foreign countries in payment for oil before we tackle the grand challenge of creating a new transportation future that does not rely completely on oil. This article presents the historical facts relative to America's oil demand and domestic and world oil production resources. These historical trends are used to construct a scenario of future supply and demand for oil in the US. A range of existing technologies, which can reduce the need for petroleum imports, are then evaluated using <b>wedges</b> analysis, giving <b>projections</b> to the year 2030. Peak oil Oil imports Transportation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the challenging tasks in current R amp;D applications {{in the field of}} renewable energy sources experimental neutron and electron tomographic data sets of PEM fuel cell components are processed by an advanced version of the DIRECTT algorithm. The neutron measurements of the water distribution suffer from several intrinsic limitations such as massive position dependent focal smearing due to the large primary neutron beam aperture. Electron TEM tomography allows characterisation of nanometre sized catalyst particles but is hampered by the following restrictions partial opacity, a limited sector of <b>projections</b> missing <b>wedge,</b> very few <b>projections,</b> samples exceeding the detector size region of interest and improper angular alignment. Beyond the capabilities of other algorithms DIRECTT proves to overcome these essential reconstruction problems, in comparison to FBP and SIRT. Nevertheless, careful data pre processing is an inevitable requirement in order to fully exploit the algorithm amp; 8223;s potential...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{mountain}} road slope failures triggered by earthquake activities and torrential rain namely {{to create the}} disaster. Province Road No. 24 is a main route to the Wutai Township. The area {{of the study is}} located at the mileages between 46 K and 47 K along the road. However, the road has been suffered frequent damages as a result of landslide and slope failures during typhoon seasons. An understanding of the sliding behaviors in the area appears to be necessary. Slope failures triggered by earthquake activities and heavy rainfalls occur frequently. The study is to understand the mechanism of slope failures and to look for the {{way to deal with the}} situation. In order to achieve these objectives, this paper is based on theoretical and structural geology data interpretation program to assess the potential slope sliding behavior. The study showed an intimate relationship between the landslide behavior of the slopes and the stratum materials, based on structural geology analysis method to analysis slope stability and finds the slope safety coefficient to predict the sites of destroyed layer. According to the case study and parameter analyses results, the slope mainly slips direction compared to the site located in the southeast area. Find rainfall to result in the rise of groundwater level is main reason of the landslide mechanism. Future need to set up effective horizontal drain at corrective location, that can effective restrain {{mountain road}} slope failures and increase stability of slope.
