5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world <b>where</b> <b>people</b> die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people.

Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E

Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E
