500|$|In the 2010 MLB All-Star Game, Wilson debuted a pair {{of bright}} orange cleats and {{continued}} to wear them throughout the season. On July 27, Marlins' manager Edwin Rodríguez complained that the shoes were too bright. Wilson received a $1,000 fine from MLB the next day, and he responded by coloring half of the shoes black with a marker. He said afterwards, [...] "The fact that he (Rodríguez) thinks these shoes throw 97–100 with cut {{might be a little}} far-fetched. I guess <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have these checked for performance-enhancing cleats." [...] He also stated that he was punished [...] "for having too much awesome on my feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 25, 2012, Weill {{apparently}} reversed {{course on}} the financial supermarket. [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> do is go and split up investment banking from banking, have banks be deposit takers, have banks make commercial loans and real estate loans, have banks do something that’s not going to risk the taxpayer dollars, that's not too big to fail," [...] Weill said on CNBC. [...] "If they want to hedge what they're doing with their investments, {{let them do it}} in a way that’s going to be mark-to-market so they're never going to be hit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> meet," [...] he replied, {{sheathing}} his sword, [...] "but I was not prophetic enough to foretell the exact {{circumstances of the}} meeting." ...|$|E
60|$|Mamma, {{directly}} she {{saw he was}} in earnest, said no more, and we set {{out soon}} afterwards, {{with the understanding that}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> most <b>probably</b> not be back until evening.|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} {{to us that}} we might have some difficulty in utilizing this smile in our present affairs, and that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>probably</b> preferred something more assuring, but Captain Jim's faith was contagious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why if a boy continues," [...] said Wallace, [...] "when he {{is quite}} old, to take {{pleasure}} in amusements which generally please only young children, that is boyishness of a harmless kind. For example, suppose <b>we</b> <b>should</b> see a boy, eighteen years old, playing marbles a great deal, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{say that he was}} boyish. So if you were to have a rattle or any other such little toy for a plaything, and should {{spend a great deal of}} time in playing with it, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> say that it was very boyish or childish. Still that kind of boyishness does little harm, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>probably</b> do any thing about it, but should leave you to outgrow it in your own time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you and I might {{agree to}} wake {{each other up}} several times, from a sound sleep, and then, if we were dreaming at that time, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> {{remember}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once across, I don't so much mind. Even {{if we were}} detected, {{we should}} simply be two fugitives from here, trying to make our way to Gibraltar; and I don't {{think there would be}} any {{question}} of my being a spy. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be sent to wherever they keep the English prisoners they have taken in ships; and there would be nothing very dreadful in that, even for her. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be exchanged, before long. There have been several batches sent in to the Rock, in exchange for prisoners taken in prizes brought in by privateers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} I should feel that I had {{more in common}} with the cottagers. We should be {{interested}} in the same things, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> know the same people and have more to talk about--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Leger smiled. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm uncommonly {{glad to hear}} it; and {{in regard}} to the other {{question}} neither of us has any intention of blaming you. So far, we have been a good deal better off than <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> ever have been in England." ...|$|R
60|$|He eyed {{me in that}} disagreeable way of his {{and demanded}} to know, in case they {{accepted}} my suggestion, what their status would be in event of our {{finding a way to}} escape with the U-33. I replied that I felt that if we had all worked loyally together <b>we</b> <b>should</b> leave Caprona upon a common footing, and to that end I suggested that should the remote possibility of our escape in the submarine develop into reality, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> then immediately make for the nearest neutral port and give ourselves {{into the hands of the}} authorities, when <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all <b>probably</b> be interned for the duration of the war. To my surprise he agreed that this was fair and told me that they would accept my conditions and that I could depend upon their loyalty to the common cause.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} what you mean," [...] she continued, hurriedly, [...] "and what you would say, but for the fear of hurting me--us, I mean; for Hetty loves her father quite as well as I do. But this is not as we think of Indians. They never scalp an unhurt prisoner, but would rather take him away alive, unless, indeed, the fierce wish for torturing should get the mastery of them. I fear nothing for my father's scalp, and little for his life. Could they steal on us in the night, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all <b>probably</b> suffer in this way; but men taken in open strife are seldom injured; not, at least, until the time of torture comes." ...|$|R
60|$|Nathaniel and I used {{to stand}} by {{watching}} them, and wishing {{that we might be}} allowed to throw the line, but never quite getting up our courage to say so, knowing full well <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> make a tangle of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} {{beautiful}} country," [...] he continued, [...] "and very dear to its people. To strangers, though, and specially you who have been brought up in America, I must confess that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> seem outside the pale of civilization." ...|$|E
60|$|Clearly {{all that}} we could do was to trust to our sense of feeling, and attempt the passage in the dark, so in we crept, fearing that if we delayed to do so our {{exhaustion}} would overcome us, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> lie down and die where we were.|$|E
5000|$|He also {{discussed}} whom <b>we</b> <b>should</b> pray to. First he said <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not pray to dead human souls, {{as we have}} no reason to think they hear our prayers or have any power to help us. Then he discussed whether <b>we</b> <b>should</b> pray to angels or not. Unlike Morgan - who thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> pray to both God and angels - Chubb thought <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not pray to angels. He said even though they are “ministering spirits,” we cannot be sure they hear our prayers, and they might not be at liberty to help us without God’s direct guidance. He finally spent ten pages wondering whether <b>we</b> <b>should</b> pray to Jesus or just to God the Father. He concluded that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> pray to God the Father “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The Broadway production, {{directed}} by Prince and choreographed by Fuller, opened on November 16, 1981 at the Alvin Theatre. The show opened to mostly negative reviews. While {{the score was}} widely praised, critics and audiences alike felt that the book was problematic and the themes left a sour taste in their mouths. Hampered by the several critical reviews published prior to its official opening, {{as well as more}} negative ones published afterwards, it ran for only 16 performances and 52 previews. In his New York Times review Frank Rich wrote [...] "As <b>we</b> all <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have learned by now, to be a Stephen Sondheim fan is to have one's heart broken at regular intervals." [...] Clive Barnes wrote, [...] "Whatever you may have heard about it - go and see it for yourselves. It is far too good a musical to be judged by those twin kangaroo courts of word of mouth and critical consensus." ...|$|R
40|$|To be honest, I {{thought this}} would be a lost cause.   Even after {{skipping}} a New Drugs and Devices essay in 2012, I figured that I would have to search long and hard to find ten new things that emergency practitioners needed to know about.   Although there were no true blockbuster medications for emergency physicians, I nonetheless found ten medicines that <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> know, along with a new device that may change the way we work up patients with palpitations, and a clever new delivery system for subcutaneous epinephrine.

6000|$|Deringham {{glanced at}} her covertly, and noticed the faint sparkle {{in her eyes and}} the scornful set of her lips. [...] "That depends," [...] he said, [...] "partly upon our kinsman's attitude, for if he offered us {{hospitality}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> stay a little. You were also right, my dear, as usual." ...|$|E
60|$|Ruggles and I {{meant to}} get square with the Old Fellow, if {{it took all}} the term; at least, we said so. But if Providence hadn't sent Sylvia Grant {{walking down the street}} past our {{boarding}} house that afternoon, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have cooled off before we thought of any working plan of revenge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even if {{the boats}} {{have not been}} here," [...] Nat said to Lippincott, [...] "I don't think we shall have any trouble with them; they will have heard our guns, and, I dare say, the musketry firing, and will know that, now we are awake and on our guard, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> sink them before they reached us." ...|$|E
60|$|Three or {{four hundred}} years ago there was {{undoubtedly}} much less labour in England, {{in proportion to the}} population, than at present, but there was much more dependence, and <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not now enjoy our present degree of civil liberty if the poor, by the introduction of manufactures, had not been enabled to give something in exchange for the provisions of the great Lords, instead of being dependent upon their bounty. Even the greatest enemies of trade and manufactures, and I do not reckon myself a very determined friend to them, must allow that when they were introduced into England, liberty came in their train.|$|R
5000|$|The news of what {{happened}} did not reach Canning until 16 September. He wrote to Rev. William Leigh: [...] "Did I not tell you we would save Plumstead from bombardment?" [...] One week later he wrote: [...] "Nothing ever was more brilliant, more salutary or more effectual than the success Copenhagen" [...] and Perceval expressed similar sentiments. The Times said that the confiscation of the Danish fleet was [...] "a bare act of self-preservation" [...] and noticed the short distance between Denmark and Ireland or north-east Scotland. William Cobbett in his Political Register wrote that it was [...] "vile mockery" [...] and [...] "mere party cavilling" [...] to claim that Denmark had the means to preserve her neutrality. William Wilberforce MP said the expedition could be defended on grounds of self-defence. Thomas Grenville wrote to his brother Lord Grenville {{that he could not}} help feeling [...] "that in their government's situation <b>we</b> <b>should</b> very <b>probably</b> have given the same order without being able to publish to Parliament the grounds on which we had believed in the hostile mind of Denmark". Lord Erskine condemned it by saying [...] "if hell did not exist before, Providence would create it now to punish ministers for that damnable measure".|$|R
60|$|Where two phenomena, {{between the}} laws or {{properties}} of which, considered in themselves, no connection can be traced, are thus reciprocally cause and effect, each capable in its turn of being produced from the other, and each, when it produces the other, ceasing itself to exist (as water is produced from oxygen and hydrogen, and oxygen and hydrogen are reproduced from water); this causation {{of the two}} phenomena by one another, each being generated by the other’s destruction, is properly transformation. The idea of chemical composition is an idea of transformation, but of a transformation which is incomplete; since we consider the oxygen and hydrogen {{to be present in}} the water as oxygen and hydrogen, and capable of being discovered in it if our senses were sufficiently keen: a supposition (for it is no more) grounded solely {{on the fact that the}} weight of the water is the sum of the separate weights of the two ingredients. If there had not been this exception to the entire disappearance, in the compound, of the laws of the separate ingredients; if the combined agents had not, in this one particular of weight, preserved their own laws, and produced a joint result equal to the sum of their separate results; <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never, <b>probably,</b> have had the notion now implied by the words chemical composition; and, in the facts of water produced from hydrogen and oxygen, and hydrogen and oxygen produced from water, as the transformation would have been complete, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have seen only a transformation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{that is a}} heavy bill indeed; forty-eight men {{killed and}} two officers--why, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have lost less in an action against a frigate of our own size! However, we have {{destroyed}} this nest of pirates, and have captured three of their four ships, the other is blown up. Now, what {{is the state of}} things here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{one in a}} hundred," [...] the Professor replied gloomily. [...] "If we {{were only}} this short {{distance}} out of Port Said, and {{on one of the}} recognised trade routes, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> meet half-a-dozen before mid-day. Here we are simply in the wilds. The way we are going leads to nowhere and finishes in an utterly uninhabitable jungle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a Spanish ship of war, sir, somewhere off Alicante, at present. She is got up as a merchantman, {{and took}} us in thoroughly; and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have been caught, {{if it had}} not been for Mr. Repton," [...] and he then related how Bob had swum on board, and {{discovered}} the supposed merchantman to be a ship of war.|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, he {{gradually}} became more comfortable discussing the work, calling it [...] "too advanced" [...] {{to have been}} released in 1967. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin disputes this, saying that Wilson invented this story as a generic line to feed journalists in 2004, and that [...] "being {{ahead of his time}} is exactly what they were looking for." [...] In 1993, Mike Love believed that Smile [...] "would have been a great record," [...] but in its unfinished state is [...] "nothing, it's just fragments." [...] In 2013, Jardine felt [...] "There's performances <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have finished. I can't tell you exactly what they are, but that's the way I feel." [...] In the early 1990s, Carl said that he loved the Smile lyrics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} financially unsuccessful. Fired Up! had {{a budget of}} $20 million and took in a box office gross of $18,599,102 worldwide before leaving theaters. It opened up to the U.S. box office at number 9 with $5.4 million behind films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop, which was in its sixth week of release at the time, and Confessions of a Shopaholic, in its second. On the DVD commentary, the business it did (or lack thereof) is discussed, with director Will Gluck stating, [...] "In retrospect, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have done R, but I {{kind of like the}} idea of doing a movie that everyone can go see, and not just 'over 18 or have to sneak into it.'" [...] It left American cinemas after seven weeks.|$|R
60|$|For example, by the {{electric}} machine we can produce, {{in the midst}} of known circumstances, the phenomena which nature exhibits on a grander scale in the form of lightning and thunder. Now let any one consider what amount of knowledge of the effects and laws of electric agency mankind could have obtained from the mere observation of thunder-storms, and compare it with that which they have gained, and may expect to gain, from electrical and galvanic experiments. This example is the more striking, now that we have reason to believe that electric action is of all natural phenomena (except heat) the most pervading and universal, which, therefore, it might antecedently have been supposed could stand least in need of artificial means of production to enable it to be studied; while the fact is so much the contrary, that without {{the electric}} machine, the Leyden jar, and the voltaic battery, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> never have suspected the existence of electricity {{as one of the great}} agents in nature; the few electric phenomena <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have known of would have continued to be regarded either as supernatural, or as a sort of anomalies and eccentricities in the order of the universe.|$|R
60|$|These few {{examples}} are sufficient {{to show that}} both the habits and instincts of animals are subject to variation; and had we {{a sufficient number of}} detailed observations <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> find that these variations were as numerous, as diverse in character, as large in amount, and as independent of each other as those which we have seen to characterise their bodily structure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kendrick," [...] he said, [...] "I am a {{good friend}} and a good enemy; Peter Phipps is my enemy. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> shake hands if we met, we might even {{sit down at the}} same table, but we know the truth.
