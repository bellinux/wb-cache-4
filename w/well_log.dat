40|$|Production from {{unconventional}} reservoirs {{has gained}} an increased attention among operators in North America during past {{years and is}} believed to secure the energy demand for next decades. Economic production from unconventional reservoirs is mainly attributed to realizing the complexities and key fundamentals of reservoir formation properties. Geomechanical <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> (including <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> such as total minimum horizontal stress, Poisson’s ratio, and Young, shear, and bulk modulus) are secured source to obtain these substantial shale rock properties. However, running these geomechanical <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> for the entire asset is not a common practice {{that is associated with}} the cost of obtaining these <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> In this study, synthetic geomechanical <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> for a Marcellus shale asset located in southern Pennsylvania are generated using data-driven modeling. Full-field geomechanical distributions (map and volumes) of this asset for five geomechanical properties are also created using general geostatistical methods coupled with data-driven modeling. The results showed that synthetic geomechanical <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> and real field logs fall into each other when the input dataset has not seen the real field <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> Geomechanical distributions of the Marcellus shale improved significantly when full-field data is incorporated in the geostatistical calculations...|$|R

40|$|The present project aims to reinterpret the Centenera 2 <b>well</b> <b>logs,</b> being focused {{mainly in}} the {{improvement}} of the interpretation of porosities and other characteristics present in the formations. In order to complete this objective, it has been developed a methodology that could be applicable to similar studies, especially when old <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> are studied. The methodology begins with a process that consists on transforming the original paper <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> into digital format <b>well</b> <b>logs,</b> so they can be treated by computer. Then, the digitized <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> are corrected for well effects (temperature, diameter, mud density, etc.). Later, a general interpretation of the well is made, subdividing it in several zones geologically different, for this way to choose more economic interest zones. Finally a quantitative interpretation of the formations is carried out, determining their porosities through different methods. The data obtained by the methodology, demonstrated the existence of formations potentially producers of gas, the same ones that have bigger porosities to those described by studies in past decades...|$|R
