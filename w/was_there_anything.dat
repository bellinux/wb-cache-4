6000|$|Bear witness, once my comrades, what a hard-bit gang were we-- [...] The {{servants}} of the sweep-head, but {{the masters of}} the sea!

6000|$|... "There is no {{relevancy}} {{about this}} kind of argument; you said yourself that the dog was probably worth a hundred dollars, I only asked you three; <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> unfair about that?

60|$|Never <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> better Tim'd, the Keepers and {{all their}} Assistants being obliged to a strict Attendance on the Sessions at the Old Bailey, which held for about a Week; and Blewskin having confin'd Jonathan Wild to his Chamber, a more {{favourable}} opportunity could not have presented for Mr. Sheppard's Purposes.|$|E

6000|$|Was Betty really {{unlike other}} girls? That is to say, unlike {{them in any}} respect wherein she should {{resemble}} them?
