30|$|This {{technique}} involves injecting {{water and}} CO 2 in combination into the reservoir {{at the same}} well. The mixing of CO 2 and water in a CO 2 -SWAG injection can be at the downhole or on the surface. Surface mixing usually occurs at the <b>well,</b> <b>drill</b> site or at the central processing facility. The objective of this technique {{is to improve the}} sweep efficiency of the CO 2 -flooding by reducing the impact of viscous fingering. At the same time, this reduces the capital and operating costs and finally will result in an improvement in gas handling and oil recovery (Ma et al. 1995; Sanchez 1999). The simultaneous water and gas injection can be difficult to implement and there can be some practical difficulties associated with this technology.|$|E
40|$|Formation {{damage caused}} by {{particles}} and filtrate invasions {{has been identified as}} one of the major problems that cause serious damage to the formation, thus it results in reduction of oil and gas productivity. It occurs throughout the life of an oilwell, especially during drilling a horizontal well. In a horizontal <b>well,</b> <b>drill</b> string eccentricity phenomenon tends to occur mostly due to the gravitational effect and this phenomenon would contribute to formation damage. A formation damage rig with 6 " hole and 3. 5 " drill string simulating a slim-hole drilling had been designed to facilitate the investigation of damage on Berea sandstones caused by oil-based mud in dynamic condition at various differential pressures, drill string rotations, and exposure times. The rig was also used to investigate the damage of Berea sandstones in horizontal and vertical wells. The experimental results showed that the drill string eccentricity did contribute to the permeability reduction and became critical as differential pressure, drill string rotation speed, and exposure time were increased. The eff~ct of drill string eccentricity at 250 psi induced differential pressure encountered lesser permeability impairment compared to 200 psi. SEM studies showed the presence of micro fractures in the cores when exposed to differential pressure of 250 psi, which increases the permeability of the Berea sandstones (improved permeability). SEM visualization revealed that the particles plugging and deposition in pore spaces in horizontal well was found to be more severe than vertical well, thus it induced higher damage in the former wel...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} has been to develop new types of drill-in fluids (DIFs) and {{completion}} fluids (CFs) for use in natural gas reservoirs. Phase 1 {{of the project was}} a 24 month study to develop the concept of advanced type of fluids usable in well completions. Phase 1 tested this concept and created a kinetic mathematical model to accurately track the fluid’s behavior under downhole conditions. Phase 2 includes tests of the new materials and practices. Work includes the preparation of new materials and the deployment of the new fluids and new practices to the field. This is the final report on a program that has been operating for 7 years, including the last four years under the sponsorship of the U. S. DOE. Accomplishments of Research Program The project addresses the special problem of formation damage issues related to the use of CFs and DIFs in open hole horizontal well completions. The concept of a “removable filtercake ” has, as its basis, a mechanism to initiate or trigger the removal process. Our approach to developing such a mechanism is to identify the components of the filtercake and measure the change in the characteristics of these components when certain cleanup (filtercake removal) techniques are employed. The program has been an unqualified success. We have accomplished the following: Development of New Laboratory Testing Practices Established standard testing practices Identification of key factors involved in formation damage Established appropriate cleanup practices for removal of formation damage to optimize productivity.
