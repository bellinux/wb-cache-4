5|$|The {{clarinet}} is a musical-instrument family {{belonging to}} the group known as the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical tube <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist).|$|E

5|$|A {{widespread}} species <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> cosmopolitan distribution, it {{has been}} reported from Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania), Asia (China, Himalayas, Japan, southern India), Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America (Brazil). It has been collected from subarctic areas of Greenland, and subalpine regions in Iceland. In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges from Alaska to Mexico, although it is less common in Central America. The species is popular on postage stamps, and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea, Paraguay, Romania, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The Country Wife {{was first}} {{performed}} in January 1675, by the King's Company, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This luxurious playhouse, designed by Christopher Wren and with room for 2,000 spectators, had opened only the year before. It was of compact design, retaining {{in spite of}} its large seating capacity much of the intimate actor/audience contact of the Elizabethan theatre, still <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> Elizabethan-size forestage or apron stage, on which actors would come forward for maximum audience contact.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Library, {{belonging}} to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (Københavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} renamed Moonlight when {{picked up by}} CBS on May 14, 2007, prior the upfronts. David Greenwalt, creator of Miracles and co-creator of Angel, joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and {{executive}} producer alongside Silver. CBS hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson, however health reasons forced {{him to leave the}} series, and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007. All of the original actors save for the lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. To promote the series, Silver, {{along with the rest of}} the main cast, attended the Comic-Con International in San Diego on July 27, 2007, where the show was featured.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{commissioned}} by Warner Bros. Television in 2007 as a presentation lasting 14–20 minutes. Alex O'Loughlin, Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were cast in the lead roles, and Rod Holcomb was hired as director. David Greenwalt joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer with Joel Silver; however, health reasons forced Greenwalt to leave the series. All of the original actors, apart from the male lead role, were recast in June 2007, and Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but {{his inability to}} find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon {{in and out of}} foster care, they lived <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela, 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.|$|E
5|$|As local {{football}} {{continued to}} expand after the war, {{and with the}} success of the newly formed Yorkshire League, demand for another senior team in York arose. At a meeting held at the Co-operative Hall in York on 6 May 1922, {{the decision was made to}} form the York City Association Football and Athletic Club Limited, with W. H. Shaw as chairman. Despite having neither a ground nor players, an application was made for election to the Football League; this was unsuccessful, but the club was admitted to the Midland League on 10 June 1922. York's first match was away to Notts County reserves on 6 September 1922, and despite a good performance the team lost 4–2. York had to play their first two home matches at Mille Crux, the ground of Messrs Rowntree & Company Limited, because their Fulfordgate ground was not ready. Their first match at Fulfordgate came on 20 September 1922, with a 4–1 victory against Mansfield Town. York finished 1922–23 in 19th place; they had been placed midtable in early March 1923 but failed to win any of their remaining 14 fixtures. In the same year, York reached the final of the North Riding Senior Cup, but lost 4–2 to Middlesbrough reserves at Ayresome Park on 10 March 1923. The club's first season proved disappointing financially, with a loss of £718 reported, and as a consequence Shaw relinquished the chairmanship to Arthur Brown. York entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1923–24 and reached the first qualifying round, losing 3–1 to Mexborough Town in a second replay. They again ranked 19th in the table <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> identical record to the previous season's.|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E
