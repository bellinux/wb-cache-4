5|$|During the {{two years}} after their breakup, Ching-teng has no contact with Chia-yi. He qualifies for a {{graduate}} research course at Tunghai University, where he begins writing stories online. Ching-teng only regains contact with Chia-yi after the 921 earthquake, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> {{to see if she}} is okay. During their long conversation with each other, they both lament {{the fact that they were}} not fated to become a couple.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E

A vision of Jamie is seen along with every other companion aside from Leela (who was omitted by mistake in post-production) on the scanner screen in Resurrection of the Daleks.|$|E

25|$|Jim Gordon learns {{his wife}} has been in an accident, due to her alcoholism. At the same time his daughter, dressed as Batgirl, is {{fighting}} crime. Black Canary robs a group of snuff film makers and proceeds to set them on fire. Batgirl is later arrested, and Jim is shown to be deeply depressed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> his former lover Sarah {{at the suggestion of}} his daughter.|$|E
25|$|After {{talking to}} his contacts, {{including}} journalist friend Arthur Nabler (Jerry Adler), he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him murdered. But <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the police, he becomes {{a suspect in the}} man's death. The police and the FBI are also very interested in this case. Bernstein makes a connection with a local gangster, Sal (Stanley Tucci), uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war about illegal gas rationing, and the Federal government. His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at an Italian restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{the fact}} that he was not {{considered}} Roman, Odoacer's ethnic origins are not completely known. Both the Anonymus Valesianus and John of Antioch state his father's name was Edeko. However, it is unclear whether this Edeko is identical to one—or both—men of the same name who lived at this time: one was an ambassador of Attila to the court in Constantinople, and escorted Priscus and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila's camp; the other, according to Jordanes, is mentioned with Hunulfus as chieftains of the Scirii, who were soundly defeated by the Ostrogoths at the river Bolia in Pannonia sometime in the late 460s. Since Sebastian Tillemont in the 17th century, all three have been considered to be the same person. In his Getica, Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the Turcilingi (Turc-ilingi or Torcilingorum rex). However, in his Romana, the same author defines him as a member of the Rugii (Odoacer genere Rogus). The Consularia Italica calls him king of the Heruli, while Theophanes appears to be guessing <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> him a Goth.|$|E

25|$|Leon, Fatboy and Peter {{plan to go}} to a {{party in}} Hampshire, but Lucy, Whitney and Zsa Zsa offer Leon a night out in the woods instead, {{planning}} revenge getting Lucy pregnant and lying to Zsa Zsa. In the woods, Zsa Zsa comes out with pig's blood on her hands saying that she has been attacked. Knowing that it is a plan, Leon runs away and drunkenly ventures into the dark woods, cutting his hand. The next day the gang discover that Lucy let Leon run off and he was out all night. Peter and Fatboy then fear they hit Leon with the van the night before. Fatboy gets a voicemail from Leon saying he is hurt, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> back, Zsa Zsa finds Leon's mobile phone in the leaves, smeared with blood. They decide to go to the police but Leon turns up, having been in police custody overnight for being drunk. Leon reveals that Lucy had an abortion and they all realise that Lucy was trying to turn them against him, so on their return to Walford, they play a prank on Lucy, leaving her humiliated. However, Lucy reveals to her father that they are squatting in one of his properties and he evicts them.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{for his new}} job, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{meets with}} investors. Although the {{investing}} window had closed, Jim insists on taking part and offers $10,000 under pressure—much more than he and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) had agreed to. After Jim returns, he tells Pam during the Here Comes Treble's performance, and they start arguing during the singing. When the group begins performing [...] "Faith", Andy is surprised that Rob appears via video to sing the lead. The group mistakenly thought the song was to be dedicated to Andy, and they contacted Rob to sing it with them. The [...] "concert" [...] ends and Andy continues to argue with Rob as Rob halfheartedly apologizes for stealing Andy's song until Erin finally puts {{an end to the}} video chat. Andy entertains the idea of moving to Cornell to keep his legacy alive. Alarmed, Erin redirects him towards using his family's money to create a scholarship for young a cappella singers. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> his mother to set it up, she informs him the family has lost all their money.|$|E
500|$|Lody {{was also}} the subject of {{literary}} and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, Lody – Ein Weg um Ehre (Lody – One Way to Honour), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers (Lody: {{the life and death}} of a German officer), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues behind him as he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked [...] "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> for German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters in the pockets of suits which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: [...] "I shall see Germany once more –from the stars." [...] The Dundee Evening Telegraph described the storyline as [...] "quaint".|$|E

2500|$|When Anne Shirley {{arrives at}} the Cuthberts' farm, called [...] "Green Gables", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly {{sensitive}} about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, {{in a dispute over}} her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe’s head <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> her [...] "Carrots" [...] on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride.|$|E
2500|$|Shaftesbury {{took great}} pains in the {{elaboration}} of his style, and he succeeded {{so far as to}} make his meaning transparent. The thought is always clear. But, on the other hand, he did not equally succeed in attaining elegance, an object at which he seems equally to have aimed. There is a curious affectation about his style—a falsetto note—which, notwithstanding all his efforts to please, is often irritating to the reader. Its main characteristic is perhaps best hit off by Charles Lamb <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> it genteel. He poses too much as a fine gentleman, and is so anxious not to be taken for a pedant of the vulgar scholastic kind that he falls into the hardly more attractive pedantry of the aesthete and virtuoso. In the early 20th century Fowler and Mitchell stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Blob {{is played}} by Kevin Durand in the film [...] Fred Dukes was once part of Team X, {{composed}} of himself, James Howlett, Victor Creed, William Stryker, David North, Chris Bradley, John Wraith, and Wade Wilson. After the team disbands, the once-muscular and formidable mutant soldier developed an eating disorder and became extremely obese. Wraith now has him in training as a boxer to lose weight. Wraith warns Logan not {{to make fun of}} his weight, but Logan taunts Dukes, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> him [...] "Bub", Dukes mishears this as [...] "blob" [...] and starts fighting him. Dukes' mass absorbs Logan's blows, giving him the upper hand until he accidentally stuns himself with a head-butt to Logan's adamantium-reinforced skull, allowing Logan to knock him out by slamming his elbow onto Dukes' head. Once revived, Dukes reveals that Creed and Stryker are working together, capturing mutants and experimenting on them, having allegedly learned the information from Agent Zero. In a deleted scene included in the DVD release, it is revealed that Creed managed to subdue Dukes and interrogated him for information on Logan's whereabouts.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the closest}} of confidants, Beavis and Butt-Head have a jaded, violent, {{and at times}} {{borderline}} sadistic relationship. Butt-Head often insults and physically abuses Beavis (usually by slapping him, sometimes accompanied by a request to [...] "Settle down, Beavis!" [...] if Butt-Head feels his friend is getting a bit too hyperactive, as he often does). On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (“Madame Blavatsky”, “They're Coming to Take Me Away, Huh Huh”). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In [...] "Canoe", he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across {{the head with a}} paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it). Butt-Head usually knows when Beavis is approaching his breaking point and will back off (as seen <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Beavis [...] "Buttknocker" [...] or insults Metallica one too many times). In [...] "Choke", he specifically states that Butt-Head is [...] "not really my friend". Nevertheless, it can be inferred that the duo are still best friends, considering their shared activities, residency, interests, and their lack of any other friends. The two usually complement each other when one makes any sort of endeavor, especially if it involves their lifelong goal to 'score with chicks'.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome Mittelman, known on-air as [...] "Jerome from Manhattan," [...] is a die-hard Yankees and Knicks fan. Jerome {{is known}} for his on-air take-no-prisoners {{blistering}} rants and raves, as well as his unique take on the English language. One of his favorite exclamatory phrases is [...] "frickin' frack!" [...] He refers to the bullpen as the [...] "ballpen", and once shouted that the Yankees are [...] "... done! D-O-E-N , DONE!" [...] His relationship status is intriguing enough for Steve Somers to once give Jerome $60 to take a lady out on a date, only for Jerome to keep the money and not go out on the date. Former host Sid Rosenberg once asked Jerome if he was upset that he was not taking his eagerly anticipated trip [...] "... to Colorado?", and Jerome replied, [...] "No, [...] to Denver." [...] He does [...] "... not like jets. They make [...] seasick." [...] Jerome, when he still called WFAN regularly, was known as being the only caller to have an audio intro, much like those played at the top of each show. Mr. Mittelman's health problems had kept him from the WFAN airwaves on a regular basis from late 2004 until mid-2008; when he again started to call in more frequently. Occasionally <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> into Steve Somers' program, a special introduction is played to the tune of The Twilight Zone.|$|E

[...] Suddenly, Emma appears as the other Dark One, to {{convince}} Hook that they can work together to stop the Darkness by bonding together in love, and their kiss causes the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin to disappear. Later that night, Hook feels the [...] "pull" [...] of Excalibur towards the Dagger of the Dark One, despite Emma's claim that Excalibur had disappeared. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Emma back, she admits that she has Excalibur, because Hook told her that he couldn't resist the darkness, making Hook furious with her lack of trust in him. Hook tells her that he had always trusted her, and that {{he was the one who}} told Emma's parents that she had to decide on her own not to crush Merida's heart in the past, before disappearing. Later on, Emma is forced to summon him with the Excalibur fragment later, just to have a conversation, angering him even more by the fact that she had used Excalibur to [...] "force" [...] him to come. She gives him Excalibur so that he can be in control of himself and they share a kiss.|$|E
