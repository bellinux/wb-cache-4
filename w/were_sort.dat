We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> of magic even though he was just getting it wrong.

500|$|Released in July, the Beatles' second film, Help!, {{was again}} {{directed}} by Lester. Described as [...] "mainly a relentless spoof of Bond", it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band. McCartney said: [...] "Help! was great but it wasn't our film – we <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> of guest stars. It was fun, but basically, {{as an idea}} for a film, it was a bit wrong." [...] The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: [...] "Help!" [...] and [...] "Ticket to Ride". The accompanying album, the group's fifth studio LP, contained all original material save for two covers, [...] "Act Naturally" [...] and [...] "Dizzy Miss Lizzy"; they were the last covers the band would include on an album, with the exception of Let It Be brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song [...] "Maggie Mae".

[...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought {{we were all in}} a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But I felt like the lead because it was my story about falling in love with this woman and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where you take a character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E

Chandler explained: [...] "There were five guitar overdubs all linking in together to sound like one guitar." [...] The song, which Redding and Mitchell had not yet heard before that day, was completed during the session. Chandler had decided that they should discard the rough version of [...] "Third Stone from the Sun" [...] from December 13 and re-record the song; they completed a basic track for the piece, but were unable to achieve a finished master. The group managed to produce an acceptable live recording of the basic track for [...] "Fire" [...] after seven takes. Next, they attempted Hendrix's newly written ballad, [...] "The Wind Cries Mary". Without the benefit of rehearsals, the band recorded the song in one take, to which Hendrix added several guitar overdubs; Chandler estimated that they spent approximately 20 minutes on the completed rhythm track. According to Chandler, by this time Redding and Mitchell had begun to complain about their limited input. Chandler explained that financial considerations influenced the creative dynamic: [...] " [...] <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> of fighting {{the fact that they had}} no say during recording sessions... they were starting to come up with suggestions, but... We didn't need to be arguing with Noel for ten minutes and Mitch for five... We just couldn't afford the time." ...|$|E

At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> of teenage like. I wanted to make a change for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would still look at me as a little girl and I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes. Marlon Jackson also produced the single and provided backing vocals along with his brothers Michael, Tito, and Jackie. Although it was slated for a mid-July release, [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was released on August 13, 1984.|$|E

Byrne [...] of BigLove and completed his collaborations with Fatboy Slim on the album and musical HereLiesLove and the single [...] "ToeJam". Eno produced Coldplay's VivalaVida or DeathandAllHisFriends and U2's NoLineontheHorizon. Byrne and Eno discussed the former's collaboration with FatboySlim and ChrisMartin of Coldplay wrote lyrics to the instrumental track for [...] "OneFineDay", but acquiesced when he heard Byrne's version (the band would also adapt another one of Eno's instrumental compositions that Byrne did not finish into a track on VivalaVida). Once Byrne's version of [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was finished, the two began in earnest writing the rest of the tracks. Byrne initially had a long delay in writing material, but as the project progressed, he got to working several hours a day on the album and put his collaboration with FatboySlim on hold to finish the songs {{in the early part of}} 2008. Since the two did not work together face-to-face as they had in the past, it was harder for them to complete material quickly, and they had to rush to complete two of the tracks were finished at the end of the sessions. He later described the process as easy once details <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> out and summed up this method as [...] "purejoy" [...] and declared writing collaboratively to be easier than writing solo. He even credited the time between their last collaboration and the transatlantic distance as a strength, since it allowed the two to keep their own schedules. Eno agreed, as it gave him time to focus on a small piece of music without holding up Byrne's progress. Byrne later used a similar approach through 2010 and 2011 in collaborations with St.Vincent (Love This Giant) and WillOldham (the soundtrack to This Must Be the Place).|$|E
