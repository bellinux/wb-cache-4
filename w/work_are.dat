5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the <b>work</b> <b>are</b> intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{from the}} {{evolutionary}} point of view, {{the members of}} genus Shigella (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) should be classified as E. coli strains, a phenomenon termed taxa in disguise. Similarly, other strains of E. coli (e.g. the K-12 strain commonly used in recombinant DNA <b>work)</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently different that they would merit reclassification.|$|E

50|$|Most of Filonov's <b>works</b> <b>were</b> {{saved by}} his sister Yevdokiya Nikolayevna Glebova. She stored the {{paintings}} in the Russian Museum's archives and eventually donated them as a gift. Exhibitions of Filonov's <b>work</b> <b>were</b> forbidden. In 1967, an exhibition of Filonov's <b>works</b> in Novosibirsk <b>was</b> permitted. In 1988, his <b>work</b> <b>was</b> allowed in the Russian Museum.

5|$|Twyfelfontein is {{situated}} in the Huab valley of the Mount Etjo formation in southern Kunene Region of Namibia, an area formerly known as Damaraland. The rocks containing the art <b>work</b> <b>are</b> situated in a valley flanked by the slopes of a sandstone table mountain. An underground aquifer on an impermeable layer of shale sustains a spring in this otherwise very dry area.|$|E
5|$|Among the Antaimoro people, the {{production}} of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists. Embroidery and drawn thread <b>work</b> <b>are</b> done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets. A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development {{of fine arts in}} Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|Alice Frey's <b>work</b> <b>was</b> widely {{exhibited}} in her lifetime. In her later years she became profoundly deaf and lived alone in Ostend. On {{her death in}} 1981, much of her <b>work</b> <b>was</b> sold at auction, and only the small collection that she willed to Ostend is accessible. Stylistically, Frey's <b>work</b> <b>was</b> influenced by Marc Chagall, Ensor, and Edgard Tytgat. Her early <b>works</b> <b>are</b> expressionist, while her later <b>work</b> may <b>be</b> closer to magic realism.|$|R

5|$|Among the {{national}} collections containing Mellor's <b>work</b> <b>are</b> the National Gallery of Australia, which owns his prize-winning From Rite to Ritual, and the Parliament House Art Collection. Most other major Australian art collections have holdings, including the state gallery {{of his birth}} state, Queensland, and the main public gallery of the city where he completed much of his tertiary study, the Canberra Museum and Gallery. Other state and territory galleries {{in which he is}} represented include the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the National Gallery of Victoria. Public regional galleries that have collected Mellor's creations include Newcastle Regional Art Gallery in New South Wales, and Warrnambool Art Gallery in Victoria. He is also represented in the Australian government's collection, Artbank, as well as in large, private collections such as the Kerry Stokes.|$|E
5|$|Dohavali (दोहावली, 1581), {{literally}} Collection of Dohas, {{is a work}} {{consisting of}} 573 miscellaneous Doha and Sortha verses mainly in Braja with some verses in Awadhi. The verses are aphorisms on topics related to tact, political wisdom, righteousness {{and the purpose of}} life. 85 Dohas from this <b>work</b> <b>are</b> also found in the Ramcharitmanas, 35 in Ramagya Prashna, two in Vairagya Sandipani and some in Rama Satsai, another work of 700 Dohas attributed to Tulsidas.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the <b>work</b> <b>are</b> unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, 3% of {{the parish}} {{population}} were unemployed and 25% were retired. The retirement figure increased in the Pinelands and Ravenswing areas, with a statistic of 42%. Most residents' places of <b>work</b> <b>are</b> in surrounding towns, with their location in the parish largely dictating {{where to look for}} work. The 2005 survey identified that residents in the south {{of the parish}} (Falcon Fields and Ravenswing/Pinelands) travel towards Tadley and Basingstoke whereas those further north in the parish tend to find work in Reading, Newbury and London.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{character}} of the buildings in the town derives from the use of local stone, much of it from the Town Quarry. Notable among the architects working in the 19th century was Hans Price (1835–1912). Many examples of his <b>work</b> <b>are</b> still to be seen: the Town Hall, the Mercury Office, the Constitutional Club (originally the Lodge of St Kew), villas and numerous other domestic dwellings. The Odeon Cinema by Thomas Cecil Howitt is notable for fully retaining many Art Deco features both internally and externally, and retaining its original theatre organ, a Compton from 1935. It {{is believed to be the}} only cinema organ in the West Country left working in its original location and is still in regular use. Other organs by Compton in Weston-super-Mare can be found at Victoria Methodist Church and All Saints' Church by George Bodley (modelled on that in Downside Abbey).|$|E
50|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Muyzhel wrote short stories, novellas, and {{the play}} Spring Wind (1923). Muyzhel's <b>works</b> <b>were</b> {{published}} in popular journals; his early <b>works</b> <b>were</b> published in Russkoye Bogatstvo, and his later <b>works</b> <b>were</b> published in Maxim Gorky's Znanie collections.|$|R

5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this <b>work</b> <b>are</b> likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E
5|$|The Passion of Martin Luther King was {{composed}} in 1968 following King's assassination. The Passion was first recorded in London in 1969, with Ezio Flagello, the composer's brother, as the bass baritone soloist. This performance was eventually released by Naxos American Classics in 2012. DePreist conducted the National Symphony Orchestra's first {{performance of the}} work at the Kennedy Center on February 19, 1974. Music critics drew comparisons to Johann Sebastian Bach's Passions, which recounts Jesus' death. The Oregon Symphony album was the first published recording of the work. Bazemore provided bass vocals, with additional vocals by the Portland Symphonic Choir, directed by Bruce Browne. The nine sections of the <b>work</b> <b>are</b> performed with a brief pause in between.|$|E
5|$|The Standing Committee is {{the highest}} body when the CCDI is not convened for a plenary session. Elected by the 1st Plenary Session of the CCDI, it {{requires}} approval from the 1st plenary session of the Central Committee to take office. The Standing Committee presents {{a report to the}} CCDI at every plenary session; the latter is the only national-level organisation, with the National People's Congress and the Central Committee, which holds at least one plenary session a year. CCDI plenary sessions, which discuss its past and future <b>work,</b> <b>are</b> usually held in January. The 18th Standing Committee has 19 members, one of whom (Huang Xiaowei) is a woman.|$|E

5|$|The {{cultural}} and artistic exhibits include a 15th-century ring, a 16th-century cross, and amber jewelry {{from the past}} four centuries, {{as well as a}} number of rosaries, cigarette holders, and decorative boxes. The missing amber artifacts that were dated to the Neolithic era have been reconstructed by archeologists. Selections of modern amber <b>work</b> <b>are</b> part of the collection, including pieces by the Lithuanian artists Horstas Taleikis, Dionyzas Varkalis, Jonas Urbonas, and others.|$|E
5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important. But I think I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's opinions of my <b>work</b> <b>are</b> coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. You just have to do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E
5|$|These revelations {{make the}} {{painting}} difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its {{strong emphasis on}} colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form {{can be seen to}} mark the beginning of the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier <b>work</b> <b>are</b> here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} <b>work</b> <b>is</b> an encoding {{system for}} Carnatic music notation.
