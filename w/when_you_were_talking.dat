6000|$|... "Well, Wilfrid," [...] Mr. Atherton said, {{turning to}} him, [...] "I hope your disapproval of Marion's conduct on this {{occasion}} is not so great as it was <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to me yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary's face darkened. [...] "I call to mind," [...] said she, [...] "that a {{note was}} brought her by Hannekin the stable varlet <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to us, fair sir, {{of the terms}} of the chase. She read it and went forth." ...|$|E

60|$|I thought no {{one knew}} but me till this morning, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to Arthur. Then I thought you must know too. My heart was in my mouth, I was afraid {{you were going to}} tell him. But you didn't, and I thought I'd been mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} hand you're playing from; it's {{a pretty good}} one. Mr. Allinson {{believes}} he gave you orders to make the caches in certain places; you contend he told you somewhere else, and there was nobody about <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to decide the thing. Somehow an unfortunate mistake was made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And,' said Jane, 'I should {{guess that}} Miss Ada herself knew {{something}} about it, for when I {{could not find the}} puzzle in the right-hand cupboard, she was so very unwilling that I should look into that one; she said there was nothing there but the boys' old playthings and Esther's clothes. And I do not know whether you saw how she fidgeted <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about the quinces, before you went up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew what}} it 'ud be with them two on the same ship," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Wilks. [...] "I didn't say nothing <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Miss Kate, but I knew well enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{mind was}} already made up. He said calmly, 'Father, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> to Miss Aldclyffe, mention {{to her that}} I have asked Adelaide if she is willing to marry me next Christmas. She is {{interested}} in my union with Adelaide, and the news will be welcome to her.' ...|$|R

There he's {{speaking}} now! His syllables Are those <b>you</b> sound yourself <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> unawares, [...] As this pretty girl declares." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{you seem}} happier, you look happier. It isn't only that, I can't explain how you impress me. It struck me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to Mr. Bentley the other day. You {{seem to see}} {{something}} you didn't see when I first met you, that you didn't see {{the first time we}} were at Mr. Bentley's together. Your attitude is fixed--directed. You have made a decision of some sort--a momentous one, I rather think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, boys, I don't {{know how}} you take it, {{but it seems to}} me that this is not a healthy place to stop in. We cannot always keep {{together}} and always be on our guard, and they may pick us up one after the other. I thought <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> yesterday about Judge Lynch that you were away from the mark. He has been to two or three camps where I have been, and it ain't no manner of good bucking against him. My opinion is, the sooner we git the better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had to {{say what}} I thought," [...] she {{continued}} earnestly; [...] "I stood {{it as long as}} I could. Perhaps you didn't realize it, but my father was striking at me when he referred to your sermon, and spiritual control--and in other things he said <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about the settlement-house. He reserves for himself the right to do as he pleases, but insists that those who surround him shall adopt the subserviency which he thinks proper {{for the rest of the}} world. If he were a Christian himself, I shouldn't mind it so much." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked how}} best to raise doubts and {{question}} evolution with non-believers, Johnson responded: What I am not doing is bringing the Bible into the university and saying, [...] "We should believe this." [...] Bringing the Bible into question works very well <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> to a Bible-believing audience. But it is a disastrous thing to do <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking,</b> as I <b>am</b> constantly, to a world of people for whom the fact that something is in the Bible is a reason for not believing it.You see, if {{they thought they had}} good evidence for something, and then they saw it in the Bible, they would begin to doubt. That is what has to be kept out of the argument if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to do what I to do, which is to focus on the defects in their evolutionist's case—the bad logic, the bad science, the bad reasoning, and the bad evidence.|$|R

5000|$|A second {{argument}} {{before the}} Court {{took place in}} October 1966. Medina requested the Court declare the privacy law in question unconstitutional, because, [...] "in this field of privacy, I merely suggest that when it <b>is</b> nondefamatory and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about a public fact, we should have the protection that the fellow who comes in to sue us must prove both falsity and knowledge of falsity, or recklessness, {{and that this is}} a minimum, because, mind you, this article here, the dissent in the appelate division, found it was an informative presentation of legitimate news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could you say No, {{with that}} plaster on your neck?" [...] was the ready rejoinder. [...] "I am {{determined}} {{to know more}} than the newspaper tells me. Will you declare, on your word of honor, that Captain Bervie {{had nothing to do}} with the duel? Can you look me in the face, and say that the real cause of the quarrel was a disagreement at cards? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> with me just before I left the ball, how did you answer a gentleman who asked you to make one at the whist-table? You said, 'I don't play at cards.' Ah! You thought I had forgotten that? Don't kiss my hand! Trust me with the whole truth, or say good-by forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you will}} worry {{me into a}} fever," [...] Cyril replied. [...] "I am getting on well now, and as you said, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of it before, you should leave John {{in charge of the}} house and shop, {{he will be able to}} do {{everything}} that is necessary for me. If you stay here, and the Plague increases, I shall keep on worrying myself at the thought that you are risking your lives needlessly for me, and if it should come into the house, and any of you die, I shall charge myself all my life with having been the cause of your death. I pray you, for my sake as well as your own, to lose no time in going to the sister Captain Dave spoke of, down near Gloucester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet it {{goes into}} my very bosom. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to that clergyman at dinner I could see every sparkle that came from it. Then I wonder to myself whether you can ever be {{thinking}} of me as I am always thinking of you." [...] She {{knew that she had}} been thinking of him every waking moment since she had been at Albury and through many of her sleeping moments also. [...] "Ayala, one little word, one other glance from your eyes, one slightest touch from your hand upon my arm, shall tell me,--shall tell me,--shall tell me that I am the happiest, the proudest man in all the world." [...] She walked on steadfastly, closing her very teeth against a word, with her eyes fixed before her so that no slightest glance should wander. Her two hands were in her little muff, and she kept them with her fingers clasped together, as though afraid lest one might rebel, and fly away, and touch the sleeve of his coat. [...] "Ayala, how is it to be with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Charles Lavington, <b>you</b> remember, <b>was</b> a solicitor," [...] Mrs. Milvain interposed, rather resenting {{the waste}} of time {{involved}} in talking about fictitious people <b>when</b> <b>you</b> might <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> about real people.

6000|$|... "He's {{a splendid}} young man, and good," [...] she assured Saxon. [...] "His face shows that. And, best of all, he loves <b>you</b> and <b>is</b> proud of <b>you.</b> You can't imagine how I have enjoyed {{watching}} {{the way he}} looks at <b>you,</b> especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking.</b> He respects your judgment. Why, he must, for here he <b>is</b> with <b>you</b> on this pilgrimage which is wholly your idea." [...] Mrs. Mortimer sighed. [...] "You are very fortunate, dear child, very fortunate. And you don't yet know what a man's brain is. Wait till he is quite fired with enthusiasm for your project. <b>You</b> will <b>be</b> astounded {{by the way he}} takes hold. You will have to exert yourself to keep up with him. In the meantime, you must lead. Remember, he is city bred. It will be a struggle to wean him from the only life he's known." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why did {{you tell}} her? She could not but have spoken her mind <b>when</b> <b>you</b> told her. There must have <b>been</b> much between <b>you</b> <b>when</b> this <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> of." ...|$|R
6000|$|One afternoon, {{when the}} four {{had been out}} for a drive {{together}} to visit the old ruins near Cowhayne, and Harry had been sketching with Gladys and lecturing to the countess to his heart's content, {{he was sitting on}} the bench by the red cedars, when to his surprise he saw the governess strolling carelessly across the terrace towards him. [...] "Mr. Vardon," [...] she said, standing beside the bench, [...] "I want to say something to you. You mustn't mind my saying it, but I feel it is part of my duty. Do you think you ought to pay so much attention to Gladys? You and I come into a family of this sort on peculiar terms, you know. They don't think we are quite the same sort of human beings as themselves. Now, I'm half afraid--I don't like to say so, but I think it better I should say it than my lady--I'm half afraid that Gladys is getting her head too much filled with you. Whatever she does, you are always helping her. She is for ever running off to see you about something or other. She is very young; she meets very few other men; and you have been extremely attentive to her. But when people like these admit you into their family, they do so on the tacit understanding that you will not do what they would call abusing the position. To-day, I half fancied that my lady looked at you once or twice <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to Gladys, and I thought I would try to be brave enough to speak to you about it. If I don't, I think she will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, briefly; {{she could}} not say more; and Hinkle went on. [...] "It seemed to me, {{that as far as}} I could make him out, he was about as much of a crank in his way as the Russian. It's curious, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about religion, the other day, you made me think of him!" [...] The blood went to Clementina's heart. [...] "I don't suppose you had him in mind, but what you said fitted him more than anyone I know of. I could have almost {{believed}} that he had been trying to convert you!" [...] She stared at him, and he laughed. [...] "He tackled me one day there in Florence all of a sudden, and I didn't know what to say, exactly. Of course, I respected his earnestness; but I couldn't accept his view of things and I tried to tell him so. I had to say just where I stood, and why, and I mentioned some books that helped to get me there. He said he never read anything that went counter to his faith; and I saw that he didn't want to save me, so much as he wanted to convince me. He didn't know it, and I didn't tell him that I knew it, but I got him to let me drop the subject. He seems to have been left over from a time when people didn't reason about their beliefs, but only argued. I didn't think there was a man like that to be found so late in the century, especially a young man. But that was just where I was mistaken. If there was to be a man of that kind at all, {{it would have to be}} a young one. He'll be a good deal opener-minded when he's older. He was conscientious; I could see that; and he did take the Russian's death to heart as long as he was dead. But I'd like to talk with him ten years from now; he wouldn't be where he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Lydiard {{looked at}} him with an {{expression}} of satirical surprise. [...] "Mr. Hardyman," [...] she said, [...] "this makes the fourth time you have questioned me about Isabel. You seem to take a great interest in my little companion. Don't make any apologies, pray! You pay Isabel a compliment, and, as I am very fond of her, I am naturally gratified when I find her admired. At the same time," [...] she added, with one of her abrupt transitions of language, [...] "I had my eye on you, and I had my eye on her, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> in the next room; and I don't mean to let you make a fool of the girl. She is not in your line of life, and the sooner you know it the better. You make me laugh when you ask if she is related to gentlefolks. She is the orphan daughter of a chemist in the country. Her relations haven't a penny to bless themselves with, except an old aunt, who lives in a village on two or three hundred a year. I heard of the girl by accident. When she lost her father and mother, her aunt offered to take her. Isabel said, 'No, thank you; I will not be a burden on a relation who has only enough for herself. A girl can earn an honest living if she tries; and I mean to try'--that's what she said. I admired her independence," [...] her Ladyship proceeded, ascending again to the higher regions of thought and expression. [...] "My niece's marriage, just at that time, had left me alone in this great house. I proposed to Isabel to come to me as companion and reader for a few weeks, and to decide for herself whether she liked the life or not. We have never been separated since that time. I could hardly be fonder of her if she were my own daughter; and she returns my affection with all her heart. She has excellent qualities--prudent, cheerful, sweet-tempered; with good sense enough to understand what her place is in the world, as distinguished from her place in my regard. I have taken care, for her own sake, never to leave that part of the question in any doubt. It would be cruel kindness to deceive her as to her future position when she marries. I shall take good care that the man who pays his addresses to her is a man in her rank of life. I know but too well, in the case of one of my own relatives, what miseries unequal marriages bring with them. Excuse me for troubling you at this length on domestic matters. I am very fond of Isabel; and a girl's head is so easily turned. Now you know what her position really is, you will also know what limits there must be to the expression of your interest in her. I am sure we understand each other; and I say no more." ...|$|E
40|$|One {{should always}} {{subordinate}} {{his own personal}} views, whether they be economic, social, political, or whatever they may <b>be,</b> because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about your own views <b>you</b> <b>are</b> only one of millions of individu-als in the country. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> interpreting the law, perhaps you have a special skill and special training that does give {{you the right to}} pass on these questions.

But I will do my very best to subordinate those con-siderations because I think that is the duty of any judge. — Justice John Stevens, in his Senate confirmation hearing It is a commonplace, in the press and popular discussions, to characterize the Supreme Court in terms of the ideological divisions among its members. In the Roberts 2006 – 2009 court, for example, Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito are typically thought of as the Court’s conservative wing, while Justices Kennedy and O’Connor are depicted as moderates, and Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer as part of the Court’s liberal wing. This ideological characterization of the court can be a useful starting point in ana-lyzing the behavior of Supreme Court justices.

40|$|A {{topological space}} is a {{generalization}} of a metric space that {{allows one to}} talk about limits, convergence, continuity and so on without requiring {{the concept of a}} distance between points in the space. It is based on the observation that, in the theory of metric spaces, the definitions of limits and continuity can be formulated without the word “metric” appearing in the definitions, if you know what the open subsets of the metric space are. Here is the definition. Definition 1 (Topological Space) A topological space (X, T) is a set X together with a collection T of subsets of X that satisfies the axioms ⊲ ∅ ∈ T and X ∈ T ⊲ The union of any collection of sets in T is also in T. ⊲ The intersection of any finite collection of sets in T is also in T. The sets in T are called the open subsets of X. Usually <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about a topological space (X, T), {{it is clear from the}} context what T <b>is.</b> Then <b>you</b> usually just refer to the “topological space X”. Once you have specified what sets <b>are</b> open, <b>you</b> can import a large number of definitions from the theory of metric spaces...|$|R
40|$|What does “affordable ” mean <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> {{about human}} life? Take {{a moment to}} imagine what the society we live in could do with an {{infinite}} amount of money. We could build a huge public transportation system that eliminates car accidents, pollution, and noise. We could use only solar power and switch to 100 per- cent recycling, eliminating the major remaining causes of pollution; this would greatly reduce environmental carcinogens and oxidizing agents that cause cancer, heart disease, and premature aging. In addition, it would delay global warming, which threatens to put much of civilization under water, leading to countless deaths in the process. We could completely mechanize industry, eliminating occupational accidents. Finally, we could create a highly advanced health system that provides full MRI body scans and comprehensive laboratory screening tests {{for everyone in the}} population to ensure that cancers and other disorders are detected at the earliest possible stage. As it is, there are very few nations that can even provide safe drinking water to all their citizens.

People are always in too big a hurry in this world about all sorts of things as well as wells. I am a well-digger and I know all about them. We know if there is any water in the ground it will always find its way to the deepest hole there is, and we dig a well so as to give it a deep hole to go to in the place where we want it. But you can't expect the water to come to that hole just the very day it's finished. Of course you will get some, because it's right there in the neighborhood, but there is always a lot more that will come if you give it time.
