5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete {{for access to}} females. Such competition can {{take the form of}} fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, males {{migrate to the}} northern ends of the species range to feed, while females forage near {{the breeding}} rookeries. Sea lions can stay at sea {{for as long as}} two <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> They make continuous dives, returning to the surface to rest. Sea lions may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul-out between each sea trip. Adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter; adult males molt in January and February. Gulf of California sea lions do not migrate; they stay in the Gulf year-round.|$|E
5|$|Converge {{began writing}} Axe to Fall in November 2008. With Jacob Bannon, Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within {{a half a}} mile {{of each other in}} Boston, and Ben Koller living a couple hours away in Brooklyn, Converge could easily {{practice}} for <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched for <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver for <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when they had never been together {{for more than a few}} days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E
5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly {{on the beach and}} pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off for <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E
5|$|Wonder Stories had a {{circulation}} of about 25,000 in 1934, {{comparable to that of}} Amazing Stories, which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, Wonder Stories Reprint Annual, but it never appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazines—Pirate Stories and High Seas Adventures—but neither was successful. Wonder Stories was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay Laurence Manning, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks for <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass the dealers, he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute Wonder Stories solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of Beacon Magazines and on 21 February 1936 Wonder Stories was sold.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of atopic {{dermatitis}} is typically with moisturizers and steroid creams. The steroid creams should generally be of mid- to high strength {{and used for}} less than two <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as side effects can occur. Antibiotics may be required if {{there are signs of}} skin infection. Contact dermatitis is typically treated by avoiding the allergen or irritant. Antihistamines may help with sleep and to decrease nighttime scratching.|$|E

25|$|From the 1840s, hydropathics were {{established}} across Britain. Initially, {{many of these}} were small institutions, catering to at most dozens of patients.
