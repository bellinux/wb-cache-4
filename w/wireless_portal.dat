5000|$|Lack of openness: Many {{wireless}} carriers {{sold their}} WAP services as [...] "open", {{in that they}} allowed users to reach any service expressed in WML and published on the Internet. However, they also made sure that the first page that clients accessed was their own [...] "wireless portal", which they controlled very closely. Some carriers also turned off editing or accessing the address bar in the device's browser. To facilitate users wanting to go off deck, an address bar on a form on a page linked off the hard coded home page was provided. It {{makes it easier for}} carriers to implement filtering of off deck WML sites by URLs or to disable the address bar in the future if the carrier decides to switch all users to a walled garden model. Given the difficulty in typing up fully qualified URLs on a phone keyboard, most users would give up going [...] "off portal" [...] or out of the walled garden; by not letting third parties put their own entries on the operators' <b>wireless</b> <b>portal,</b> some contend that operators cut themselves off from a valuable opportunity. On the other hand, some operators argue that their customers would have wanted them to manage the experience and, on such a constrained device, avoid giving access to too many services.|$|E

Web services might offer a solution, but they typically include XML protocols that are too “heavy ” for mobile devices. The authors ’ proposed framework is designed to adapt Web services to mobile environments by using mobile agents to enable the development of high-performance Web service applications. Although mobile devices tend to sharecertain functionalities, they run onmany different platforms, which means their development environments vary widely. As a result, users often run into integration problems when attempt-ing to access desktop applications via mobile devices. Could Web services pro-vide an answer? Web services can act as mobile clients, independent of a given mobile device’s operating system or the client’s applica-tion. We can use one of three architec-tures to implement a mobile Web service, as they’re usually known in the mobile domain: a <b>wireless</b> <b>portal</b> network, the wireless extended Internet, or a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network. 1 A <b>wireless</b> <b>portal</b> network has a gateway between the mobile client and the Web service provider; this gateway takes care of all SOAP/HTTP requests and returns respons-es in a supported format. In a wireless extended Internet architecture, mobile clients interact directly with Web service providers; they’re true Web services clients and can send or receive SOAP messages. 1 In a P 2 P network, mobile devices can also act as Web service providers in addition to requesting Web services, which is especially beneficial in ad hoc networks. In this article, we’ll describe our agent-based mobile services framework. It uses <b>wireless</b> <b>portal</b> networks and elim-inates XML processing on mobile clients. It also offers dynamic service selection and rapid application development and deployment for Web service providers. The Technology The overhead involved in XML process-ing presents a huge problem for mobile Web services applications. Many re-searchers have experimented with perfor-mance improvements such as faster parsers, 2 data compression, 3 protocol optimizations, 4 or binary encodings, 5 but the outcome generally depends {{on the structure of}} the data used and the appli...|$|E

Today WAP users waste time navigating through a sea of menus to locate content. A solution to this problem, that adapts portal navigation structures {{for the needs of}} individual users, is presented. We show how this can radically improve the usability of <b>wireless</b> <b>portals,</b> resulting in significant revenue benefits for mobile operators. ...|$|R

We propose a conceptual model for defending against DDoS {{attacks on the}} wireless Internet, which incorporates both cooperative technological solutions and economic incentive mechanisms built on usage-based fees. Cost-effectiveness is also addressed through an illustrative implementation scheme using Policy Based Networking (PBN). By investigating both technological and economic difficulties in defense of DDoS attacks which have plagued the wired Internet, our aim here is to foster further development of wireless Internet infrastructure as a more secure and efficient platform for mobile commerce...|$|E

People or agents (or combinations thereof) can occupy roles in such a community. A multi-agent system in a mobile virtual community supports {{the activities of the}} participants which are mobile device users. Keywords: mobile computing, multi-agent, virtual community 1 Introduction In the age of virtual communities, electronic markets, <b>wireless</b> <b>portals,</b> mobile computing, and ubiquitous computing, what we see emerging is what we call mobile virtual communities where participants largely utilize mobile devices (e. g. laptop, notebook, PDAs, handheld PCs, smartphones, communicators, etc) rather than desktops. A virtual community is a conceptual space enabling sustained interactions (e. g., coordination and integration of activities and information sharing) among people across geographical boundaries. In [1], the concepts of virtual community and electronic marketplace are married. Wire [...] ...|$|R

The LRU is monitored online by an embedded sensor. Sensor data are transferred remotely to the base station using a wireless communication. After data analysis, the result of this analysis is uploaded to a Web portal for RUL estimation. Integration of <b>wireless</b> communication, Web <b>portals,</b> and prognostics allows not only RUL estimation, but also availability of this data for multiple users worldwide.|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. Wireless {{networking}} is {{a fairly}} new technology that is important in information technology (IT). Hotels, Airports, Coffee shops, and homes are all installing wireless networks at a record pace, making wireless networks {{the best choice for}} consumers. This popularity of wireless networks is because of the affordability of wireless networks devices, and the easy installation [11]. In spite of the popularity of the wireless networks, one factor that has prevented them from being even more widespread {{can be summed up in}} a single word: security. It comes as no surprise that these two – wireless and security – converge to create one of the most important topics in the IT industry today [11]. Wireless networks by nature bring about new challenges unique to its environment. One example of these new challenges is: “Signal overflow beyond physical walls”, and with these kinds of new challenges unique to wireless networks, we have new security risks. Hence wireless networks lend themselves to a host of attack possibilities and risks. That is because wireless networks provide a convenient network access point for an attacker, potentially beyond the physical security controls of the organization [7]. Therefore it is challenging for managers to introduce wireless networks and properly manage the security of wireless networks, Security problems of wireless networks are the main reason for wireless networks not being rolled out optimally [1]. In this dissertation, we aim to present to both specialist and non–specialists in the IT industry the information needed to protect a wireless network. We will first identify and discuss the different security requirements of wireless networks. After that we shall examine the technology that helps make wireless networks secure, and describe the type of attacks against wireless networks and defense techniques to secure wireless networks. The research will concentrate on wireless LANs (Local Area Networks), and leading wireless LAN protocols and standards. The result of the research will be used to create WISP (A <b>Wireless</b> Information Security <b>Portal).</b> WISP will be a tool to support the management of a secure wireless network, and help assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information systems in a wireless network environment...|$|R
