5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As <b>with</b> <b>adults,</b> {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesHeart {{transplantation}} {{in patients}} <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> {{congenital heart disease}} is increasing, yet no large studies have defined how this subgroup differs from other adult recipients. We investigated outcomes and risk factors for mortality and retransplantation among patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease compared <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> recipients. MethodsA review was performed of 18 - to 45 -year-old patients undergoing heart transplantation from 1990 – 2008 reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Trends were compared between 2 eras: era 1 (1990 – 1998) and era 2 (1999 – 2008). Multivariable semiparametric hazard models identified factors associated with time-related death and retransplantation. ResultsOf 8496 patients identified, 575 had adult congenital heart disease. The prevalence of heart transplantation among adult recipients decreased by 28 % over time (P < . 001) and increased among patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease by 41 % (P < . 001). Induction therapy use was less in patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease (66 %) compared with that seen in adult recipients (71 %, P = . 02). Steroid maintenance was less in patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease (92 %) compared with that seen in adult recipients (97 %, P < . 001). Post–heart transplantation survival among adult recipients improved over time (P = . 02) but not among patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease (P = . 81). Overall post–heart transplantation mortality (P = . 006) and retransplantation (P = . 03) were significantly higher for patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease than for adult recipients, mainly because of an early hazard phase. Adult congenital heart disease was {{a risk factor for}} both death (P < . 001) and retransplantation (P = . 04). Any induction therapy and steroid maintenance was associated with improved survival for all recipients (P = . 001). ConclusionsAdult congenital heart disease represent an increasing proportion of heart transplant recipients. Compared <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> recipients, patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease experience higher post–heart transplantation mortality and retransplantation. Immunosuppression differs among patients <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> congenital heart disease and adult recipients. Further studies should investigate whether post–heart transplantation outcomes would be improved by more aggressive induction therapy or judicious steroid tapers...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether relationship quality <b>with</b> older <b>adults</b> currently and in childhood, {{as well as}} experience <b>with</b> older <b>adults,</b> was associated <b>with</b> biases toward older adults and interest in working <b>with</b> older <b>adults</b> as a possible career area. The authors sampled undergraduate students (N = 753, M = 18. 97 years, SD = 2. 11 years) from a Northern California university. In hierarchical regression analyses, higher perceived quality of relationships <b>with</b> older <b>adult</b> family members, higher perceived social support, and lower perceived conflict from relationships <b>with</b> older <b>adults</b> {{was significantly associated with}} positive attitudes toward older adults. Interest in working <b>with</b> older <b>adults</b> was significantly associated with taking courses in aging, providing care to an older <b>adult,</b> and volunteering <b>with</b> older <b>adults.</b> These results suggest that positive relationships <b>with</b> older <b>adults</b> are useful in reducing biases, though student interactions <b>with</b> older <b>adults</b> are key in helping to promote interest in working <b>with</b> older <b>adults...</b>|$|R

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions <b>with</b> <b>adults.</b> However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus started {{developing}} its crest when {{half the size}} of adults, but Parasaurolophus juveniles grew crests when only 25% as long as adults. Juvenile Corythosaurus, along <b>with</b> <b>adults,</b> had a premaxilla-nasal fontanelle. Young and adult Corythosaurus are similar to Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus but dissimilar to Parasaurolophus in that the sutures of the skull are sinuous, and not smooth and straight. This feature helps differentiate parasaurolophins from lambeosaurins. Generally, the crests of juveniles of lambeosaurines like Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, parasaurolophines like Parasaurolophus, and primitive lambeosaurines like Kazaklambia are quite alike, although other features can be used to distinguish them.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups {{with the idea of}} doing a game show for children, a first for the network. Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows <b>with</b> <b>adults,</b> but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating <b>with</b> <b>adults.</b> While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E

5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals {{were less likely to be}} preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared <b>with</b> <b>adults.</b> It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared <b>with</b> <b>adults,</b> which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors <b>with</b> <b>adults.</b> For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate <b>with</b> <b>adults</b> for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E
