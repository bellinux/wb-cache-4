500|$|The Florida mouse {{has been}} called the gopher mouse because it shares the long, deep burrow of the gopher {{tortoise}} (Gopherus polyphemus). [...] The mouse makes nest chambers, small side passages, sometimes a pad of oak leaves and <b>wiregrasses</b> for chamber floors, and small chimney openings in the roof of the burrow. [...] It uses these openings, the main entrance, and side passages for entrance to and exit from the burrow. [...] In the absence of gopher tortoise burrows, the mouse will use those of the oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) or will make its own.|$|R
25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} are herbivore scavengers. Their diets contains over 300 {{species of}} plants. They consume {{a very wide}} range of plants, but mainly eat broad-leaved grass, regular grass, <b>wiregrass,</b> and terrestrial legumes. They also eat mushrooms, and fruits such as gopher apple, pawpaw, blackberries, and saw palmetto berries. In addition, gopher tortoises eat flowers from the genera Cnidoscolus (nettles), Tillandsia (Spanish and ball moss), Richardia, and Dyschoriste. Juvenile tortoises tend to eat more legumes, which are higher in protein, and fewer grasses and tough, fibrous plants than mature tortoises. Gopher tortoises {{have been known to}} scavenge carrion and eat excrement. As gopher tortoises usually get water from the food they eat, they usually only drink standing water in times of extreme drought.|$|E
500|$|Foster married Mildred Arthur Creighton Crooks (March 28, 1810 - June 15, 1883) in 1842. They {{had four}} children: Amalthea Camilla, Erycenia Penthecelia, Nancy Lucinda Creighton, and Marcus Lucuius. In 1867, Foster {{moved his family}} to Georgia Mountain, Alabama, where he owned six miles of Tennessee River front farming land, {{a large portion of}} the {{mountain}} and a saw mill, purchased before the war. Simultaneously, Foster operated a saw mill in Dodge County, Georgia, building a residence there in 1869. Foster participated in the area's saw mill boom, which was said to average one mill every two miles, along the industrial corridor created by the Macon and Brunswick Railroad. In his book The New South Comes to <b>Wiregrass</b> Georgia 18601910 author Mark V. Wetherington states: [...] "Ira R. Foster shipped lumber to Brunswick, where it was loaded onto timber schooners and transported to international markets like Liverpool, Rio de Janeiro, and Havana." [...] When the city of Eastman was incorporated in 1872, Foster served as its first mayor. Foster was also elected to the position of state senator in Alabama. He moved to Gadsden in 1883 when his wife died. There he built a two-story colonial home on the stage coach route, in an area which became known as Foster's Cross Roads. In the Alabama Senate, Foster was regarded as a reformer, supporting efficiency in state operations such as the consolidation of county poor farms into regional centers. His efforts, however, were largely thwarted by [...] "localist sentiment" [...] and the indifference of his fellow legislators. Foster continued to serve in the Alabama Senate until his death on November 19, 1885.|$|E

50|$|The Gulf Coast {{kangaroo}} rat is mainly nocturnal and feeds on seeds which it collects in its cheek pouches and carries {{back to its}} burrow. It lives in sparsely-vegetated locations with sandy soils, often among dunes and normally on the down-wind slope of a dune. Plants found growing in the vicinity include sea oats (Uniola paniculata), bluestem grass (Andropogon), saltgrass (Distichlis), fringe-rushes (Fimbristylis), sunflowers (Helianthus) and croton (Croton). In sparse mesquite (Prosopis) savannah in Texas it is associated with <b>wiregrasses</b> (Aristida), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta) and hooded windmill grass (Chloris cucullata), as well as prickly pear (Opuntia).|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the unpalatable Aristida spp. (<b>wiregrasses)</b> were measured in a subset of treatments contained within an extensive grazing study conducted between 1990 and 1996 in H. contortus pasture in southern Queensland. This paper reports the results from these treatments which included 2 land classes (silver-leaved and narrowleaved ironbark), 3 stocking rates (0. 3, 0. 6 and 0. 9 beasts/ha) in both native pasture and legumeoversown native pasture, all {{in the absence of}} fire. Changes in plant density and basal area of Aristida spp. reflected differences in both the survival and size of existing plants together with a large seedling recruitment in 1991. Two different taxa of Aristida spp. were distinguished; however, there were no clear differences in the response of these 2 taxa to the treatments. Grazing had the greatest impact on population dynamics through reducing basal area as stocking rate increased. Neither landscape position nor legume oversowing had a major impact on Aristida spp. The results suggest that populations of Aristida spp. will be highest under light grazing and that seedling recruitment may be episodic...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of native pastures {{requires an understanding}} of what the bounds of pasture composition, cover and soil surface condition are for healthy pastoral landscapes to persist. A survey of 107 Aristida/Bothriochloa pasture sites in inland central Queensland was conducted. The sites were chosen for their current diversity of tree cover, apparent pasture condition and soil type to assist in setting more objective bounds on condition ‘states’ in such pastures. Assessors’ estimates of pasture condition were strongly correlated with herbage mass (r =  0. 57) and projected ground cover (r =  0. 58), and moderately correlated with pasture crown cover (r =  0. 35) and tree basal area (r =  0. 32). Pasture condition was not correlated with pasture plant density or the frequency of simple guilds of pasture species. The soil type of Aristida/Bothriochloa pasture communities was generally hard-setting, low in cryptogam cover but moderately covered with litter and projected ground cover (30 – 50 %). There was no correlation between projected ground cover of pasture and estimated ground-level cover of plant crowns. Tree basal area was correlated with broad categories of soil type, probably because greater tree clearing has occurred on the more fertile, heavy-textured clay soils. Of the main perennial grasses, some showed strong soil preferences, for example Tripogon loliiformis for hard-setting soils and Dichanthium sericeum for clays. Common species, such as Chrysopogon fallax and Heteropogon contortus, had no strong soil preference. <b>Wiregrasses</b> (Aristida spp.) tended to be uncommon {{at both ends of the}} estimated pasture condition scale whereas H. contortus was far more common in pastures in good condition. Sedges (Cyperaceae) were common on all soil types and for all pasture condition ratings. Plants identified as increaser species were Tragus australianus, daisies (Asteraceae) and potentially toxic herbaceous legumes such as Indigofera spp. and Crotalaria spp. Pasture condition could not be reliably predicted based on the abundance of a single species or taxon but there may be scope for using integrated data for four to five ecologically contrasting plants such as Themeda triandra with daisies, T. loliiformis and flannel weeds (Malvaceae) ...|$|R

40|$|Managing native {{pastures}} {{for sustainable}} and economic production requires {{a good understanding}} of grazing effects on pasture dynamics. The Aristida/Bothriochloa pastures of north-eastern Australia are important for cattle production but little data on grazing pressure impacts on pastures are available to guide management decisions of producers, for land management education programs, or for predictive modelling. To address this deficiency, four different continuous grazing intensities were imposed on woodland communities over 7 or 8 years at two sites: a Eucalyptus populnea (poplar box) and a E. melanophloia (silver-leaved ironbark) community. Both sites had replicated paddocks grazed at a low, medium or high grazing pressure by +/- tree killing using herbicide (12 paddocks), and 12 ungrazed (nil grazing pressure) 1 -ha plots subjected to the same tree-killing contrasts. Grazed paddock areas were fixed and varied between 3. 5 and 21. 5 [*]ha. Differential grazing pressures were reset each autumn, by adjusting cattle numbers to consume over the next year the equivalent of 0 %, 25 %, 50 % or 75 % of the standing pasture mass available. Pasture grasses suitable as indicators of grazing pressure were identified for both communities. Under low grazing pressure, Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass) was the only desirable grass to show a significant increase in total contribution over time at both sites, although Dichanthium sericeum (Queensland bluegrass) also increased its contribution at the poplar box site. Chloris species increased their contribution as grazing pressure increased. The proportion of less palatable Aristida spp. (<b>wiregrasses)</b> in the pasture was not affected by high grazing pressure, although they increased at low grazing pressure in the poplar box community. There were no consistent changes in native legumes or weedy forb species to any treatment. Increasing grazing pressure had a greater negative effect on pasture mass, ground cover and pasture crown cover area than on changing species composition. Most changes in composition due to grazing pressure were smaller than those associated with variable seasonal rainfall, and were greater in the poplar box community. In above-average rainfall years grazing up to 50 % of autumn standing pasture mass had no detrimental effect on composition in treeless poplar box country in the short term. The pastures remained stable or improved in both communities when grazing pressure was set annually to utilise 25 % of the standing autumn forage...|$|R
2500|$|Brunswick was {{abandoned}} during the Civil War when citizens {{were ordered to}} evacuate. The city, like many others in the South, suffered from post-war depression. After one of the nation's largest lumber mills began operation on nearby St. Simons Island, economic prosperity returned.
