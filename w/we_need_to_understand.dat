The quantum Hall transition will therefore {{not be in}} the Fermi-liquid universality class, but in the F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical percolation picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} Mars' ancient climate, {{and whether}} it might have created environments habitable for life, first <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Mars' climate today. Each mission to Mars has made new advances in understanding its climate. Mars has seasonal variations in the abundances of water vapor, water ice clouds and hazes, and atmospheric dust. During southern summer, when Mars is closest to the Sun (at perihelion), solar heating can raise massive dust storms. Regional dust storms - ones having a 1000-kilometer scale - show surprising repeatability Mars-year to Mars-year. Once every decade or so, they grow into global-scale events. In contrast, during northern summer when Mars is furthest from the Sun (at aphelion), there is an equatorial water-ice cloud belt and very little dust in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor varies in abundance seasonally, with the greatest abundances in each hemisphere's summer after the seasonal polar caps have sublimated into the atmosphere. During winter, both water and carbon dioxide frost and ices form on Mars' surface. These ices form the seasonal and residual polar caps. The seasonal caps - which form each autumn and sublimate each spring - are dominated by carbon dioxide ice. The residual caps - which persist year after year - consist mostly of water ice at the north pole and water ice with a thin veneer (a few 10's of meters thick) of carbon dioxide ice at the south pole.|$|E

40|$|In many {{real life}} situations, a text {{consists}} of related parts; so, <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> a part, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> first <b>understand</b> some (or all) preceding parts: e. g., <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Chapter 3, <b>we</b> first <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Chapters 1 and 2.

Validity implies how exact information the used measure can generate from the phenomenon. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the phenomenon, the measure and the possible difference between them.

In order to evaluate validity of any measure <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the phenomenon, the measure and the possible difference between them. In the case of productivity we cannot make this evaluation in a traditional way because the phenomenon intended to be measured is somewhat unclear.
