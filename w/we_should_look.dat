It would not be possible to test from a ship, and the political advantages in demonstrating that Britain could develop and test nuclear weapons without American assistance would be foregone. The Americans were under no obligation to make the test site available for subsequent tests. Also, as Lord Cherwell noted, an American test meant that [...] "in the lamentable event of the bomb failing to detonate, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> very foolish indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2008, Square Enix {{announced}} that they were officially planning to bring Chrono Trigger to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. [...] Composer Yasunori Mitsuda {{was pleased with the}} project, exclaiming [...] "finally!" [...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E

500|$|The club's poor run of form {{continued}} in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped {{to the bottom}} of the league table. Another 3–1 defeat, against Newcastle United, was followed by a second successive 1–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches. Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United, and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season. [...] "It's nice to get three points, but now we have to build on it," [...] said Sturrock. [...] "There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again." [...] Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2–1 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper. Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2–0 at Bloomfield Road. The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle. He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway, a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. [...] "I suppose it was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better," [...] said executive director Keith Todd. [...] "We understood exactly what we are doing." ...|$|E

I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I think that to a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people." ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{are better}} advised, writes Penelope Curtis, [...] "to {{look at what}} is sculptural within Cubism. Cubist {{painting}} is an almost sculptural translation of the external world; its associated sculpture translates Cubist painting back into a semi-reality". Attempts to separate painting and sculpture, even by 1910, are very difficult. [...] "If painters used sculpture for their own ends, so sculptors exploited the new freedom too", writes Curtis, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> at what sculptors took from the discourse of painting and why. In the longer term we could read such developments as the beginning of a process in which sculpture expands, poaching painting's territory and then others, to become steadily more prominent in this century".|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the War in Iraq, Buckley stated, [...] "The {{reality of}} the {{situation}} is that missions abroad to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous." [...] He added: [...] "This isn't to say that the Iraq war is wrong, or that history will judge it to be wrong. But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events." [...] In a February 2006 column published at National Review Online and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, [...] "One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed." [...] Buckley has also stated that [...] "...it's important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that it (the war) has failed, so that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> for opportunities to cope with that failure." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of Jesus had some theological implications. [...] While some Christians thought Jesus {{should have the}} beautiful {{appearance of}} a young classical hero, and the Gnostics tended to think he could change his appearance at will, for which they cited the Meeting at Emmaus as evidence, others including the Church Fathers Justin (d.165) and Tertullian (d.220) believed, following Isaiah:, that Christ's appearance was unremarkable: [...] "he had no form nor comeliness, that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> upon him, nor beauty that we should delight in him." [...] But when the pagan Celsus ridiculed the Christian religion for having an ugly God in about 180, Origen (d. 248) cited Psalm 45:3: [...] "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, mighty one, with thy beauty and fairness" [...] Later the emphasis of leading Christian thinkers changed; Jerome (d.420) and Augustine of Hippo (d. 430) argued that Jesus must have been ideally beautiful in face and body. For Augustine he was [...] "beautiful as a child, beautiful on earth, beautiful in heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peter Tyler, though, puts {{forward a}} number of {{coherent}} objections to this line of enquiry. Firstly, as he points out, these metaphors, while present in certain Islamic sources {{in other parts of}} the Muslim world, are not always prominent in the Andalucian and North African Islamic sources. Secondly, in any case, John is using them in different ways from the Islamic sources. Thirdly, and crucially, there seems to have been little cultural interplay between Islamic culture and Christian culture in Spain by the late sixteenth century, with sources existing in different languages, not being translated, and of course all Muslims already having been forced to leave Spain. Rather, Tyler concludes, there [...] "are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to suggest <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> for Christian sources rather than Muslim sources". As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, it might make more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence.|$|E
