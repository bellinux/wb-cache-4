30|$|After each {{scenario}} was presented, {{we measured}} participants’ investment intentions {{in the company}} by means of two constructs: First, we measured their willingness {{to invest in the}} airport operator based on their answers to the question, “How likely is it that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> buy <b>shares</b> of the airport operator immediately after this decision?” (MacGregor et al. 2000). Participants indicated their willingness to invest on a scale from 1 (not likely at all) to 7 (very likely). Following Weber et al. (2002), we also assessed {{the amount of money that}} participants would invest in the company with the question, “Please assume that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be willing to invest up to 1000 € in <b>shares.</b> How much <b>would</b> <b>you</b> invest in <b>shares</b> of the airport operator immediately after this decision?” The scale ranged from 0 € to 1000 €.

As such, it might not be of interest to trained economists. Since you are reading this review in an economics journal, you may want to know whether you, as an economist, would find reading the book an efficient use of your time. Let me respond with a question. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> enjoy <b>sharing</b> a few beers with a charming and articulate colleague who is eager to offer an abundance of strongly-held and occasionally unorthodox opinions? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> find this conversation entertaining in spite of, or perhaps {{because of the fact that}} you do not always find his logic or evidence compelling?
