5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation.|$|E

A second place at the BMW Masters was followed by a third place at the Barclays Singapore Open to <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> title with two events remaining. To finish off his season, he won the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai, making birdie on the last five holes to beat Justin Rose by two strokes.

25|$|Andrew Crook scored freely for Lancashire at Sir Paul Getty's Ground at Wormsley as {{he broke}} Lancashire's one-day record with his 162 not out. Glen Chapple gave support as he scored the competition's fastest ever half-century, making 55 in just 16 balls as the {{first-class}} team finished on 370 for 4. They were denied {{the chance to}} <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> win {{on the first day}} though, as rain halted play with Buckinghamshire on 39 for 2. No play was possible on the second day, and with 10.3 overs of Buckinghamshire's innings bowled, a decision was possible on the Duckworth-Lewis method.|$|E
25|$|Stokes and Prior {{frustrated}} Australia for an {{hour and}} a half on the fifth day before Prior was dismissed for 26. Shortly afterwards, Stokes reached his maiden Test century, and the tourists went into lunch at 6/332.

Australia won by 150 runs, securing a 3–0 series lead, and with it, their first Ashes series win since 2006–07. Smith was man of the match for his hundred in the first innings.|$|E

25|$|The preseason's final {{exhibition}} was notable for six yellow cards issued on only sixteen fouls as SIUE and visiting Dayton {{met in a}} defensive struggle. The Cougars held last season's NCAA-leading scoring team to only three shots {{en route to the}} shutout win. The Flyers defense kept the Cougars from getting off shots for much of the game before the SIUE offense started to click with a flurry of late shots. Australian forward Lachlan McLean scored in the 89th minute on a pass from Ohio State transfer Greg Solawa to <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Cougars' preseason with a 1–0–2 record. SIUE's goalkeeper Kyle dal Santo had three complete-game shutouts.|$|E
25|$|The {{game when}} Leicestershire won their first ever County Championship, on 15 September 1975, marked {{something}} of a personal triumph for Chris Balderstone. Batting on 51 not out against Derbyshire at Chesterfield, after close of play he changed into his football kit to play for Doncaster Rovers in an evening match 30 miles away (a 1–1 draw with Brentford). Thus {{he is the only}} player to have played League Football and first class cricket on the same day. He then returned to Chesterfield to complete a century the following morning and take three wickets to <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> title. To add to that season's success for Leicestershire was a second Benson & Hedges victory.|$|E
25|$|On the 1978 Kangaroo tour, Great Britain {{defeated}} Australia in {{the second}} test at Bradford, 18–14, before a crowd of 26,447. It took ten years, and fifteen consecutive test defeats before Britain were able to defeat the Kangaroos again, starting with Australia's 3–0 whitewash of the Lions during their 1979 Australasian tour. The Kangaroos had already won the first test 15–9 at Wigan and would <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> series with a 23–6 win in the third test at Headingley. However, the Australians were surprisingly defeated by the French team in both tests played {{at the end of}} the 1978 tour. This was the last defeat of the Kangaroos in a series until 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{bottom half}} quarter-final line-up was {{scheduled}} to play today, with only two women's singles matches taking the court. The first pitted seven-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams against Shahar Pe'er of Israel. The unseeded Williams lost the first set 6–3 but grew in confidence in the second set to take it 6–2 and push it to a deciding set. Pe'er looked on-form for victory when she went up 6–5 in the final set, {{and just a few}} points from her first major semi-final, but it was Williams who then showed her fighting spirit by winning the next three games to <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 3–6, 6–2, 8–6 victory and become one of the ten lowest-ranked women in the Open Era to compete in a Grand Slam semi-final.|$|E
25|$|Although Finn {{played no}} part in the Test series against Pakistan, he played {{a big part in}} the limited overs series. He took 4–34 in the first ODI and {{followed}} this up with the same figures in the next match as England went 2–0 up in the series. Finn a gained his good form in the next game as he took 3–24, before finishing off with 2–42 to help England win the match by 4 wickets and <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> series. He played the first T20 match, taking 1–39 as England suffered an eight run defeat. He took three wickets in the next game to help England level the series, before taking 0–31 in the final game to help England win the series 2–1.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} back to Coors Field to <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{month of}} August with a three-game {{series against the}} Rockies. The Dodgers bullpen imploded and they lost the opener 8–1. A rain out on August 30 forced the Dodgers and Rockies to play a day-night doubleheader the following day. In the opener, the Dodgers offense continued to struggle and they were routed again, 7–0. This {{was the first time}} the Rockies had shutout the Dodgers at home since August 27, 2012. In the second game, the Rockies scored five runs off of a shaky Bud Norris in the first inning but came back and won the game on a grand slam homer by Andrew Toles in the eighth inning, 10–8.|$|E
