40|$|Ontogenetic {{study on}} the {{expression}} of cytokeratin (CK) polypeptides within particular subsets of rat thymic epithelial cells (TEC) has been performed by a large panel of anti-CK monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using the streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Simultaneous presence {{of two or more}} CK subunits in the same TEC has been demonstrated by double immunoflouorescence labeling. The obtained results showed that the expression of CK polypeptides in fetal and neonatal thymus differed from the adult patterns. The main difference was observed in expression of CK 10, 18, and 19 polypeptides. During fetal ontogeny, CK 10 and 18 are markers for most medullary TEC or a subset of medullary TEC, respectively, whereas CK 19 is mainly a pan-TEC marker. In the adult animals, they are localized in the cortical and a subset of medullary TEC (CK 18), subcapsular/perivascular and some medullary TEC (CK 19), or in a subset of medullary TEC and Hasall’s corpuscles (HC) (CK 10).

Using silicone oil tamponade, which gives {{easy access to}} the fundus from the first postoperative day, the optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been used to make a fine analysis of the macula. METHODS: Our study included 13 eyes with macular hole which have undergone a vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade. An OCT was performed before the surgery, on the first postoperative day (J 1), 1 <b>week</b> (<b>S</b> 1) and 1 month (M 1) after surgery. RESULTS: The hole closure was confirmed with OCT on the first postoperative day in 11 / 13 cases. One week after surgery, 12 holes were closed. An old larger hole did not close but its borders were flattened and loosed the cystic aspect. CONCLUSIONS: OCT in macular hole surgery with silicone oil tamponade confirms that in the majority of the cases the hole closes within the first 24 hours. It seems that the hole closure could be speeded by internal limiting membrane peeling. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
