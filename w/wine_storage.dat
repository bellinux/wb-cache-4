5|$|The {{basement}} of the house initially served as the <b>wine</b> <b>storage</b> area. In 1867, the family had a one-and-a-half-story brick winery constructed. After 1900, when wine grapes were no longer grown commercially, this building served as a storage room. Rübel later converted it to a museum for Ramona visitors, complete with Del Valle family artifacts. In the 21st century it is used for storage of farm equipment and automobiles.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of wine production has been discovered in the Zagros Mountains; both the settlements of Hajji Firuz Tepe and Godin Tepe have given evidence of <b>wine</b> <b>storage</b> dating between 3500 and 5400 BC.|$|E
25|$|If wine {{is stored}} in {{conditions}} that are too dry, the cork will shrink and cause leakage. Too moist, and mould and contamination may occur. Climate Controlled <b>Wine</b> <b>Storage</b> maintains moderate humidity levels (55%-75%) to avoid these problems and assist in the optimum wine development conditions.|$|E

25|$|Some wine experts {{debate the}} {{importance}} of humidity for proper <b>wine</b> <b>storage.</b> In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or {{the orientation of the}} bottle. However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due to the risk of the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading half an inch of gravel {{on the floor of a}} wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, the Zollhafen (by now {{clearly the}} main {{industrial}} port), was about 85% destroyed. Of the old buildings, few survived, amongst them the massive <b>wine</b> <b>storage</b> building, a concrete structure erected in 1912. However, the port quickly recovered, and {{as early as}} 1950 reached its pre-war average annual turnover, with 740,497 tonnes. The 1 million tonnes mark was reached in 1952. In the following decades, most changes were operational or technical only, such as the installation of modern cranes in the 1980s. In the 1990s, plans were then begun for a possible extension or relocation of facilities that were increasingly by their location close to the growing residential areas of the city.|$|E
500|$|The hill {{gained a}} brief {{military}} significance in 1849 {{when it was}} used as the site of an Italian gun battery, under the command of Giuseppe Garibaldi, in the successful defence of Rome against an attacking French army. Its economic significance was somewhat greater, as the hill's interior was discovered to have unusual cooling properties which investigators attributed to the ventilation produced by its porous structure. This made it ideal for <b>wine</b> <b>storage</b> and caves were excavated to keep wine cool {{in the heat of the}} Roman summer.|$|E

2500|$|Although anecdotal {{information}} regarding the contributions of vibration in <b>wine</b> <b>storage</b> states that it contributes to the accelerated ageing of wine with adverse effects, this remains a research area with relatively little data. In a particular study, vibrations of different frequencies {{have been shown to}} have their own distinct effect on the chemistry of the wine. The study concludes, [...] "Vibration could be used to accelerate the ageing of wine, but in most cases, this may lead to negative effects on wine quality. Therefore, to store red wines with limited changes in physicochemical properties, vibrations should be minimized." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} bottle storage on the colour, {{phenolics}} and volatile composition of Malvasia and Muscat wines obtained from grapes grown in Sardinia was evaluated. Colour was evaluated by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and by tristimulus colorimetry. Polyphenols were analysed by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and HPLC-DAD. GC/MS {{was used to}} identify and quantify the content of free and bound volatile compounds. As expected, the absorbance values at 420 nm increased significantly for both <b>wines</b> during <b>storage,</b> due to oxidative browning, while difference in colour (DE*) {{from the beginning of}} storage and after 18 months was more intense in the Muscat wine than in the Malvasia wine. A significant decrease was observed in different phenolic compounds over time, especially in the Malvasia <b>wine.</b> In-bottle <b>storage</b> for 18 months at 20 °C in the dark resulted in a significant decrease in all the classes of free and bound volatiles. These finding enhance knowledge regarding the effects of bottle storage on Muscat and Malvasia wines. This is of interest because, rather surprisingly, this topic has been poorly investigated in relation to these two varieties...|$|R
50|$|A baker's rack {{is a type}} of {{furniture}} with shelves, typically made of wrought iron or some other metal. Traditionally the wire shelves served to help cool a baker's goods such as hot pies. The heat-conducting metal shelving allows for heat to be quickly transferred from the bowl to the shelf.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reorganization}} of Swiss fortifications under the Army 95 program, the fort was deactivated and declared surplus. Chillon was considered for purchase by the Canton of Vaud in 1998 and was briefly opened for public tours, with the intention of making it into a museum. However, the transaction fell through. The town of Chillon waived its rights in 2004, followed by the neighboring town of Veytaux.

2500|$|The decrees proclaimed twice {{per year}} from the town hall, called Rådstugan ("Council Homestead"), once located north of the square, {{together}} with recurrent manifestations, {{such as that of}} Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson leader of the Engelbrekt Rebellion (1434–1436), made the square a politically vital location. [...] As the Germans presence in the city was very important for long, the city council was composed by equal shares of Swedish citizens and German immigrants. [...] Merchants, all burghers, dominated the assembly and craftsmen were occasionally entrusted minor commissions, while the remaining citizens were entirely excluded from any influence. [...] Stockholm was at the time a one-horse town compared to splendid continental cities. [...] The city's town hall was rebuilt following a fire in 1419 and gradually expanded over a period of 500 years until its relocation to the Bonde Palace in 1732. [...] During this era it was thus a four-storey building composed of several buildings forming a coherent complex. [...] On the third floor were custodies known as Siskeburen ("The Siskin Cage"), Loppan ("The Flea"), and Vita märren ("The Mare"), Vita hästen ("The White Horse"), Gamla Rådstugan ("Old Council Homestead"), Skottkammaren ("Scottish Chamber"), and Nya kölden ("The New Cold").

2500|$|Wine is very {{susceptible}} {{to changes in}} temperature, with temperature control being an important consideration in <b>wine</b> <b>storage.</b> If the wine is exposed to too high a temperature (in excess of [...] ) {{for long periods of}} time, it may be spoiled or become [...] "cooked" [...] and develop off-flavors that taste raisiny or stewed. The exact length of time that a wine is at risk of exposure to high temperatures will vary depending on the wine, with some wines (such as Madeira which is exposed to high temperatures during its winemaking) being able to sustain exposure to high temperatures more easily than other, more delicate wines (such as Riesling). If the wine is exposed to temperatures that are too cold, the wine can freeze and expand, causing the cork to be pushed out or (more usually) the bottle to crack; this will allow more oxygen to be exposed to the wine. Dramatic temperature swings (such as repeated transferring a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) can also cause adverse chemical reactions in the wine that may lead to a variety of wine faults. Most experts, such as Jancis Robinson, recommend that wine be kept at constant temperatures between 50 and 59°F (10 and 15°C). Tom Stevenson speculates that [...] may be the most ideal temperature for storage and aging.|$|E
50|$|The {{challenge}} for the design and construction of most wine caves {{is to create a}} fairly wide span in weak rock with low cover.

2500|$|The Weinhaus Huth, {{with its}} {{distinctive}} corner cupola, was a wedge-shaped structure {{located in the}} angle between Potsdamer Straße and Linkstraße (literally [...] "Left Street"), and with entrances in both streets. Wine merchant Friedrich Karl Christian Huth, whose great-grandfather had been kellermeister (cellar-master) to King Friedrich II back in 1769, had founded the firm in 1871 and taken over the former building in Potsdamer Straße on 23 March 1877. His son, the wine wholesale dealer William (“Willy”) Huth (1877–1967), took over the business in 1904 and, a few years later, commissioned {{the replacement of the}} building by a new one on the same site. Running right through the block into Linkstraße, this new Weinhaus Huth was designed by the architects Conrad Heidenreich (1873–1937) and Paul Michel (1877–1938), and opened on 2 October 1912, and contained a wine restaurant on the ground floor, and <b>wine</b> <b>storage</b> space above, so it had {{to take a lot of}} weight. It was thus given a strong steel skeleton, which would stand the building in very good stead some three decades after its completion. Famous for its fine claret, numerous members of European society were made welcome there as guests. A total of 15 chefs were employed there, and Alois Hitler, the stepbrother of the future Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, was a waiter there in the 1920s, before he opened his own restaurant and hotel at Wittenbergplatz, in the western part of the city.|$|E
