For example, if governing parties believe that {{a section of the}} population will either vote against them or not at all, they might hold the election in early spring, when the weather may well keep less-committed voters away from the polls. Party strategists take the timing of important rugby union matches into account, partly because a major match in the same weekend of the election will likely lower voting-levels, and partly because of a widespread belief that incumbent governments benefit from a surge of national pride when the All Blacks (the New Zealand national rugby team) win and suffer <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose.</b>|$|E

In Tangled Ever After, Pascal and Maximus appear as ring bearers at Rapunzel and Flynn's wedding. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> the couple's wedding rings, the duo frantically attempts to retrieve them. Greno and Howard created Pascal {{in order to}} provide the lonely, isolated Rapunzel with a friend to talk to. Feeling that a reptile would compliment Rapunzel's quirky personality, the directors ultimately decided to make the character a chameleon as opposed to a traditional woodland creature. Meanwhile, Maximus was originally conceived as a very serious horse based on actor Tommy Lee Jones until the animators decided to make him a funnier and more likeable character. The unusual decision to make Pascal and Maximus non-speaking characters with Welker providing them with realistic sound effects was inspired by the performances of silent film actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.|$|E
