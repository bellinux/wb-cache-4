40|$|Mobile {{services}} are already <b>widespread</b> <b>used.</b> It {{is often the}} first step for cell phones to become ubiquitous when {{they are able to}} submit location based information. Another application for mobile spatial aware systems is the combination of location with the computation of the head direction on a wearable computer. These Augmented Reality systems are mostly isolated applications. They offer a specific service in a specialized region, even in outdoor areas. When combining them with more <b>widespread</b> <b>used</b> localization techniques a whole of a city can be covered by a mobile service. This paper presents an approach, where several tracking techniques with different accuracies and reliability information, are offered within one system.

5|$|Cray {{had always}} {{attacked}} {{the problem of}} increased speed with three simultaneous advances; more execution units to give the system higher parallelism, tighter packaging to decrease signal delays, and faster components {{to allow for a}} higher clock speed.
