50|$|The Aermotor Company, {{originally}} of Chicago IL, was {{the first}} and lead manufacturer of steel fire towers from the nineteen-teens to the mid-twenties. These towers have very small cabs, because the towers are based upon Aermotor <b>windmill</b> <b>towers.</b> These towers are often found in the U.S. Midwest or the South, but few have made their way into the mountainous West. In the northeast, all of the towers in the Adirondack Mountains and most in the Catskills were Aermotor towers erected between 1916 and 1921.|$|R

5000|$|Windmills of the 18th century began {{implementing}} rotatable nacelles {{to capture}} wind coming from different directions. The yaw systems of these [...] "primitive" [...] windmills were surprisingly {{similar to the}} ones on modern wind turbines. The nacelles rotated by means of wind driven yaw drives known as fantails, or by animal power, and were mounted on the <b>windmill</b> <b>towers</b> by means of an axial gliding bearing.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Windmill</b> <b>Tower</b> {{has great}} {{aesthetic}} significance for its landmark quality, being situated on a prominent hilltop overlooking central Brisbane; a quality widely acknowledged from {{the beginnings of}} free settlement until the present day. The unusual and characteristic shape of the structure is distinctive even in the earliest pictorial representations of the Brisbane landscape. Despite subsequent city development obscuring or entirely obliterating the views to it {{from other parts of}} the area, the <b>windmill</b> <b>tower</b> is still strongly evocative and symbolic of Queensland's convict past, one of its key periods of significance.|$|E

50|$|The parish {{church of}} St Nicholas is a Grade I listed building. Its spire was removed and {{parapets}} rebuilt {{in the late}} 1960s. Within St Nicholas' Church south chapel was a shrine to Philip Ingleberd (d. c. 1324). The remains of the medieval ashlar St Philip's Cross, Grade II listed and dedicated to Ingleberd, stands on Church Lane. Further parish listed structures are a farmhouse, 2.5 mi to the south at Little Dam Lane, The Old Vicarage on Station Road, and two <b>windmill</b> <b>towers,</b> one on Mill Road, the other on Ottringham Road.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the <b>windmill</b> <b>tower</b> was {{converted}} {{for use as}} a dovecot or doocot. It once had a potence used to reach the nesting boxes and fireclay nesting boxes.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} pairs of {{millstones}} inside the tower, each driven independently by the treadmill and sail mechanisms. The former was located outside the tower, a shaft connecting the treadwheel and the mill cogwheels inside. Two sketches from the early 1830s show the <b>windmill</b> <b>tower</b> and its sail stocks in place, while an 1839 description depicts a tower built from stone and brick, comprising four floors, a treadmill and windmill. From 1829 the <b>windmill</b> <b>tower</b> {{was said to be}} continually requiring repair, possibly because its equipment was all made from locally available timber rather than iron.|$|E

50|$|In February 1836 the <b>windmill</b> <b>tower</b> {{was struck}} by lightning, causing severe damage throughout, {{including}} to the treadmill. A convict millwright was brought from Sydney in June for the repairs, which amounted to a major rebuild of the structure that was not completed until May 1837. In April 1839, with {{the closure of the}} Moreton Bay penal settlement being planned, the <b>windmill</b> <b>tower</b> was one of the buildings recommended for transfer to the colony. This was approved in 1840-41 but it continued to sporadically process grain until 1845, when due to crop failure, a stagnant population and the availability of imported flour, it finally ceased being used. The penal settlement had officially closed in February 1842. The treadmill operated until 1845 and had been removed by October 1849.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Windmill</b> <b>Tower</b> has {{potential}} to contribute new knowledge {{and a greater}} understanding of Queensland's early settlement and development.

50|$|On the <b>windmill</b> <b>tower's</b> {{interior}} {{the single}} volume spaces of each floor are {{punctuated by the}} hexagonal stair which connects {{the ground with the}} observatory house. The ground floor is a concrete slab while the upper floors are timber-framed with timber floor boards of hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii). The stair winds around a central newel and is lined with tongue-and-groove vertical boards. The treads were strengthened and protected from further wear during the 1988 conservation work. The bottom of the stair posts are founded in the ground floor concrete slab. The stair timbers are largely red cedar (Toona australis), expect for the boarding, which is hoop pine.|$|R
