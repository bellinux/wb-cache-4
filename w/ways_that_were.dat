25|$|With the {{development}} of oil painting, oil on panel began to replace tempera as a favoured method of enhancing a church. The oil paint lent itself to a richer and deeper quality of colour than tempera, and permitted the painting of textures in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> highly realistic.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but {{significant}} differences exist. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression {{as part of his}} doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.|$|E

25|$|This era {{signaled}} {{the loss of}} any lingering neoclassical, pseudo-Grecian styles in women's dress. This decline was especially evident in France due to the Emperor Napoleon's suppression of trade in the fabrics used in neoclassical dress. While waistlines were still high, they were beginning to drop slightly. Larger and more abundant decoration, especially near the hem and neckline foreshadowed greater extravagance in the coming years. More petticoats were being worn, and a stiffer, more cone-shaped skirt became popular. Stiffness could be supplemented by layers of ruffles and tucks on a hem, as well as corded or flounced petticoats. Sleeves began to be pulled, tied, and pinched in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> more influenced by romantic and gothic styles than neoclassical. Hats and hairstyles became more elaborate and trimmed, climbing higher to balance widening skirts.|$|E
25|$|During 2012, the building's {{four hundred}} {{metal halide lamps}} and {{floodlights}} were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million. The computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, on November 6, 2012, CNN used {{the top of the}} Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the 2012 United States presidential election. When incumbent president Barack Obama had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election, the lights turned blue. Had Republican challenger Mitt Romney won, the building would have been lit red. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they would not use the lights to play advertisements.|$|E
25|$|Therapsids {{and earlier}} mammaliaforms had their jaw joints very {{far back in}} the skull, partly because the ear was at the rear end of the jaw but also had {{to be close to}} the brain. This {{arrangement}} limited the size of the braincase, because it forced the jaw muscles to run round and over it. Hadrocodium's braincase and jaws were no longer bound to each other by the need to support the ear, and its jaw joint was further forward. In its descendants or those of animals with a similar arrangement, the brain case was free to expand without being constrained by the jaw and the jaw was free to change without being constrained by the need to keep the ear near the brain — in other words it now became possible for mammaliaforms both to develop large brains and to adapt their jaws and teeth in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> purely specialized for eating.|$|E

Rapid growth rates soon returned: in the period 1903–1913, GDP increased {{at an annual rate of}} 7.7%, and industry grew [...] even faster, jumping by 9.6%. By 1906, Argentina had cleared the last remnants of the 1890 default and a year later the country re-entered the international bond markets.|$|E
500|$|The {{penalty for}} anyone {{teaching}} {{or listening to}} the listed errors was excommunication, [...] "unless they turned themselves in to the bishop or the chancellor within seven days, {{in which case the}} bishop would inflict proportionate penalties." [...] The condemnation sought to stop the Master of Arts teachers from interpreting the works of Aristotle in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> contrary to the beliefs of the Church.

500|$|One of {{the details}} the team added are post-war effects that {{continue}} on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and debris scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 surround sound system, and context sensitive dialog, {{with a total of}} twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of flank attacks, and help out in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not possible in {{the first game of the}} series. Zampella said, [...] "We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience.

500|$|Aguilera {{revealed}} {{that some of}} the inspiration for the music video came from her work in Burlesque, stating, [...] "There is dancing, and I learned so much also as a dancer doing the 'Burlesque' film, moving my body in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were,</b> I feel, never as precise before [...] I really fell in love and I adapted that in the dancing for 'Not Myself Tonight,' but it was really, really fun to take what I learned from the movie." [...] She further elaborated, [...] "A lot of that [...] was based on my visual inspiration. I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it's like my creative den. He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas, and it just was really iconic imagery." [...] The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S and bondage, as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious-looking buildings. Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits, including many which were dominatrix-style.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study of}} the {{phenomenon}} in 1959 by religious history professor Ernesto de Martino revealed that most cases of tarantism were probably unrelated to spider bites. Many participants admitted {{that they had not}} been bitten, but believed they were infected by someone who had been, or that they had simply touched a spider. The result was mass panic, with a [...] "cure" [...] that allowed people to behave in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were,</b> normally, prohibited at the time. Despite their differences, tarantism and dancing mania are often considered synonymous.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some support for {{homosexual}} priests expressed {{by members of the}} clergy, including by Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of Detroit, who has argued for the ordination of gay men. [...] "Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn't know how to handle their sexuality, their sexual drive. And so they would handle it in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not healthy." [...] Furthermore, the report suggested that some priests and behavioral experts believe the church had [...] "scared priests into silence by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the breaking of celibacy vows as shameful." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{establishing}} its arguments, The Skeptical Environmentalist {{examined a}} wide range of issues in the general area of environmental studies, including environmental economics and science, and came to an equally broad set of conclusions and recommendations. Lomborg's work directly challenged popular examples of green concerns by interpreting data from some 3,000 assembled sources. The author suggested that environmentalists diverted potentially beneficial resources to less deserving environmental issues in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> economically damaging. [...] Much of the book's methodology and integrity have been subject to criticism which argue that Lomborg distorted the fields of research he covers. Support for the book was staunch as well.|$|E

Napoleon {{did not approve}} of homosexuality, but during the Consulate, when absent from Paris on military campaigns, he gave interim power to the homosexual Cambacérès. The police {{paid little attention to}} it, {{as long as it was}} not flagrant. Gay prostitutes were commonly found on the Quai Saint-Nicolas, the place Marché Neuf and the Champs-Élysées. The Prefect of Police reported in 1807 that gay persons were common among restaurateurs, limonadiers, tailors and wig-makers, [...] "in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> honest and gentle, though they were rarely faithful."
