25|$|Misuse of benzodiazepines is {{widespread}} amongst drug misusers; however, {{many of these}} people will not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or occasional misuse. Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment.</b> There is little evidence of benefit from long-term substitution therapy of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is growing evidence of the harm of long-term use of benzodiazepines, especially higher doses. Therefore, gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms. For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long-acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention as an alternative to diazepam in substance abusers dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential. In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimens of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Background - The {{process of}} <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> in Critical Care environments has created ethical and moral {{dilemmas}} {{in relation to}} {{end of life care}} in the UK and elsewhere. Common within this discourse is the differing demands made on health professionals as they strive to provide care for the dying patient and family members. Despite reports that <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> is a source of tension between those nurses and doctors involved in the process, the role of the nurse in facilitating <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> has received relatively little attention. Objectives – To illustrate how differing dying trajectories impact on decision-making underpinning <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> processes, and what nurses do to shape <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment.</b> Design - Qualitative methods of enquiry using clinical vignettes and applying Charmaz’s grounded theory method. Methods and settings - Single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with thirteen critical care nurses from four Intensive Care specialities: Cardiac; General; Neurological and Renal were carried out. Interviews were facilitated by an end-of-life vignette developed with clinical collaborators. Findings – Across critical care areas four key dying trajectories were identified. These trajectories were shaped by contested boundaries associated with delayed or stalled decision-making around how <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> should proceed. Nurses provided end of life care (including collaborative and action-oriented skills) to shape the dying trajectory of patients so as to satisfy the wishes of the patient and family, and their own professional aims. Conclusions - Differing views as to when <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> should commence and how it should be operationalised appeared to be underpinned by the requirements of the role that health professionals fulfil, with doctors focusing on making <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> decisions, and nurse’s being tasked with operationalising the processes that constitute it. Multidisciplinary teams need a ‘shared’ understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, aims, and motivations when planning and implementing the dying trajectory of <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment.</b> <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{the results of}} {{research}} undertaken to explore and describe the experience of Registered Nurses regarding the <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> from the critically ill patient in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), are discussed. <b>Withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> from a critically ill patient in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a very traumatic experience for all those involved. The Registered Nurse has the most contact with all those who are involved throughout the process. This raises questions regarding how the nurse experiences the <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment,</b> and about guidelines that can be developed to accompany the nurse {{during the process of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> The study was qualitative, descriptive, exploratory, descriptive and contextual in nature. Data was gathered by means of phenomenological interviews conducted by the researcher. Trustworthiness was ensured through the implementation of Guba’s model (in Krefting 1991 : 214). The following themes were identified: 1. The relationships the nurse develops with individuals involved in the process of <b>treatment</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> 2. The inner moral conflict experienced by the nurse relating to the ethical aspects of <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment.</b> The focus of this article is on the discussion of these experiences of the registered nurses.

50|$|Nonbenzodiazepines {{should not}} be {{discontinued}} abruptly if taken {{for more than a}} few weeks due to the risk of rebound withdrawal effects and acute withdrawal reactions, which may resemble those seen during benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Treatment</b> usually entails gradually reducing the dosage over a period of weeks or several months depending on the individual, dosage, and length of time the drug has been taken. If this approach fails, a crossover to a benzodiazepine equivalent dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine (such as chlordiazepoxide or more preferably diazepam) can be tried followed by a gradual reduction in dosage. In extreme cases and, in particular, where severe addiction and/or abuse is manifested, an inpatient detoxification may be required, with flumazenil as a possible detoxification tool.|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of life-sustaining ventilation, such as tracheostomy to critically ill patients, is commonly performed. However, {{the utilization of}} tracheostomy or extubation after a <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> decision is debated. There is a dearth of practical information available to aid clinical decision making because <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment</b> is a challenging scenario for all concerned.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} (1) {{a possible}} {{relationship between the}} functional activity of the endocannabinoid system and the facilitation of pain processing in migraineurs with medication-overuse headache, and (2) the effect of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> on both. BACKGROUND: The endocannabinoid system antinociception effect includes prevention of nociceptive pathways sensitization. The sensitization of the pain pathways has been demonstrated to be pivotal {{in the development and}} maintenance of chronic form of migraine, including medication-overuse headache. METHODS: We used the temporal summation threshold of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex to explore the spinal cord pain processing, and the platelet activity of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase to detect the functional state of the endocannabinoid system in 27 medication-overuse headache subjects before and 10 and 60 days after a standard <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> and compared results with those of 14 controls. RESULTS: A significantly reduced temporal summation threshold and increased related pain sensation was found in subjects before <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> when compared with controls. A significant fatty acid amide hydrolase activity reduction coupled with a significant improvement (reduction) in facilitation of spinal cord pain processing (increase in temporal summation threshold and reduction in related pain sensation) was found in medication-overuse headache subjects at both 10 and 60 days after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> when compared with medication-overuse headache subjects before <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment.</b> CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a marked facilitation in spinal cord pain processing in medication-overuse headache before <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> when compared with controls.

40|$|Abstract: Broiler breeder hens are {{subjected}} to feed withdrawal as production declines after about 30 weeks of age. This study investigated effects of fast and slow feed withdrawal rates in both high and low weight hens, since body weight influences energy needs and nutrient stores. Daily allotments accounted for weight differences {{between high and low}} weight groups while decreasing 20. 2 g per hen (12. 8 %) from peak production to 60 weeks in the slow <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment,</b> and 40. 4 g per hen (25. 6 %) in the fast <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment.</b> From 31 - 60 weeks, weight gain was greatest in slow (702 g), intermediate in high-fast (351 g), and least in the low-fast treatment (219 g). Egg production began earlier and was greater in the high than low weight treatment from 23 - 30 weeks, was unaffected by treatments from 31 - 40 weeks, was greater in the slow than fast <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> from 41 - 50 weeks and was greater in the low than high weight treatment from 51 - 60 weeks. Total production was unaffected by weight but 4. 6 eggs per hen less in the fast relative to slow <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment.</b> The egg weight increase from 30 - 60 weeks was 1. 4 g less in the fast relative to slow <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment.</b> Feed efficiency was better in the low than high weight treatment, but only marginally reduced by the fast relative to slow <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment.</b> These results indicate low weight breeder hens produce similar egg numbers with greater efficiency than high weight hens.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{benefits}} of immunomodulatory treatments in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) are unclear, {{calling into question}} their continuation. In the present observational study, we investigated the effect of <b>treatment</b> <b>withdrawal</b> on the clinical course of SPMS. METHODS: We included 100 consecutive patients with SPMS who regularly attended our multiple sclerosis clinic. Inclusion criteria were (i) secondary progressive phenotype for at least 2 years, (ii) immunomodulatory treatment for at least 6 months and (iii) treatment stopped with no plans to switch to another. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data before and after treatment discontinuation were assessed. Factors associated with relapses and/or MRI activity were identified. RESULTS: Mean treatment duration was 60. 4 ± 39. 3 months, and mean follow-up duration after <b>treatment</b> <b>withdrawal</b> was 62. 4 ± 38. 4 months. The annualized relapse rate remained stable at 1 and 3 years after <b>treatment</b> <b>withdrawal</b> [0. 09, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 05 - 0. 17 and 0. 07, 95 % CI, 0. 05 - 0. 11, respectively], relative to the 3 years prior to <b>treatment</b> <b>withdrawal</b> (0. 12, 95 % CI, 0. 09 - 0. 16).

40|$|Abstract Background Scant {{information}} exists {{about the}} time-course of events during <b>withdrawal</b> of life-sustaining <b>treatment.</b> We investigated {{the time required}} for end-of-life decisions, subsequent <b>withdrawal</b> of life-sustaining <b>treatment</b> and the time to death. Methods Prospective, observational study in the ICU of a tertiary paediatric hospital. Results Data on 38 cases of <b>withdrawal</b> of life-sustaining <b>treatment</b> were recorded over a 12 -month period (75 % of PICU deaths). The time from the first discussion between medical staff and parents of the subject of <b>withdrawal</b> of life-sustaining <b>treatment</b> to parents and medical staff making the decision varied widely from immediate to 457 hours (19 days) with a median time of 67. 8 hours (2. 8 days). Large variations were subsequently also observed {{from the time of}} decision to actual commencement of the process ranging from 30 minutes to 47. 3 hrs (2 days) with a median requirement of 4. 7 hours. Death was apparent to staff at a median time of 10 minutes following withdrawal of life support varying from immediate to a maximum of 6. 4 hours. Twenty-one per cent of children died more than 1 hour after <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>treatment.</b> Medical confirmation of death occurred at 0 to 35 minutes thereafter with the physician having left the bedside during withdrawal in 18 cases (48 %) to attend other patients or to allow privacy for the family.

40|$|Fixed and symptom-triggered taper methods during {{in-patient}} benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> {{were compared}} using a randomized controlled design. Forty-four benzodiazepine users seeking in-patient <b>withdrawal</b> <b>treatment</b> at two substance use treatment clinics in Adelaide, Australia were recruited. Measurements included the Severity of Dependence Scale and the SF- 36. A scale comprising six {{items from the}} Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale—Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) {{was used to measure}} withdrawal symptoms. Participants were randomized to receive a fixed diazepam tapering regime or diazepam only in response to withdrawal symptoms (symptom-triggered group). Results showed that {{there were no significant differences}} between treatment groups in terms of withdrawal severity, duration of in-patient treatment, amount of diazepam administered, treatment attrition and benzodiazepine use at follow-up. Both groups showed a reduction in benzodiazepine dosage of 86 % over the first 8 days which was maintained at 1 month post-discharge. Although there were improvements in some subscales of the SF- 36 between baseline and follow-up, values were significantly below age-matched norms at both time-points.
