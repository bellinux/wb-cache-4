5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E

5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E

The eleventh and twelfth floors of the tower are a single open space containing two large water tanks.|$|R
