5|$|He {{ruptured}} his Achilles {{midway through}} the 1987–88 season and missed almost a year of first team action.

He was limited to just six goalless appearances in 1988–89.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, the Ministerium became less {{concerned}} with {{its relationship with the}} Reformed church and saw a significant increase in Lutheran identity and the importance of the Lutheran Confessions. Thus, in 1853, the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod. However, this renewed relationship <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> short-lived.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 70s and 80s, {{many of the}} series between the West Indies and England had been {{dominated}} by the West Indies who had won fourteen of the fifteen Tests, often by large margins.

5|$|King Ottokar's Sceptre {{was first}} serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 {{under the title}} Tintin En Syldavie ("Tintin in Syldavia").

5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain.

Higginbotham scored his first goal in English football on 16 March 2002, converting a penalty to secure a 3–1 victory over Bolton Wanderers after striker Fabrizio Ravanelli backed out of taking the penalty. This <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last win of a relegation campaign, with the only remaining positive to the season for Higginbotham coming when he was voted as the fans' Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during her North American debut in 2011, Kurosaki mentioned {{that it had}} been her long-time dream to perform theme songs for anime series, and that anime {{is a big part of}} her life.

She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more imagination and inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very {{competent}} administrator, {{with the}} Soviet {{standard of living}} rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin's moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev's thaw, radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralised structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalise the ailing economic system by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path of discipline and control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects of public life.|$|E

5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E

Darlington manager Jim Platt, who was taking charge of the team for the last time before the return of David Hodgson, made one change to the side that secured progress from the semi-final stage with Tony Carss coming in at the expense of Matt Carmichael. The final <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Man of the Match Matty Appleby's last for Darlington.|$|E
