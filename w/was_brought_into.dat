5|$|Until 2009, {{the station}} had two {{operating}} furnace lines, which together {{were capable of}} burning a total of 250,000 tonnes of waste per year, and generated 20MW of electricity. However, in May 2009 a third line <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> operation. The plant currently burns 360,000 tonnes of waste a year and generates 29.2MW of electricity.

5|$|In 1963 Hydro-Québec {{purchased}} {{the shares of}} nearly all remaining privately owned electrical utilities then operating in Québec and undertook construction of the Manicouagan-Outardes hydroelectric complex. To transmit the complex's annual production of about 30 billion kWh over a distance of nearly 700km, Hydro-Québec had to innovate. Led by Jean-Jacques Archambault, it became the first utility {{in the world to}} transmit electricity at 735 kV, rather than 300–400kV which was the world standard at that time. In 1962, Hydro-Québec proceeded with the construction of the first 735kV power line in the world. The line, stretching from the Manic-Outardes dam to the Levis substation, <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> service on 29 November 1965.|$|E

5|$|The bridge <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> use on 11 December 1971, {{although}} not officially opened until 1972.

When it opened, it was the longest suspension bridge in Norway, but is now the seventh longest. There exist {{plans to build a}} second bridge to either expand the road to four lanes, or carry a proposed extension of the Bergen Light Rail. Alternatively, a subsea tunnel could be built to carry a motorway.|$|E

It was launched in January 1958, two months after Sputnik. At the creation of NASA the Explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day. Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun, measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind, among other aspects.

5|$|A {{small portion}} of Port Republic Road through Port Republic was {{included}} in the state highway system by the late 1920s as part of the highway between Waynesboro and Elkton. This section was paved in the early 1930s and carried three different route numbers until it was transferred to the secondary system in the early 1940s. Port Republic Road was placed on its modern alignment through Port Republic in the mid-1950s, by which time almost all of the highway was paved. SR 659, which was assigned to Port Republic Road from Harrisonburg to near Cross Keys, was extended southeast through Port Republic by the mid-1970s. Port Republic Road was expanded to four lanes within Harrisonburg in the mid-1990s and mid-2000s and along a short stretch south from the city limits in the early 2010s. SR 659 <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> the primary highway system as SR 253 in 2005.|$|E
