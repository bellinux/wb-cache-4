5|$|Temperatures on {{the surface}} have been {{estimated}} to lie between about −20°C with the Sun overhead, dropping to about −190°C at the winter pole. Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are −60°C and −130°C respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to perihelion, although details vary somewhat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons</b> as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons.</b> Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E

5|$|The park is open {{every day}} except Christmas (December 25) on a {{schedule}} that varies slightly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons.</b> In 2010, {{it and its}} Painted Desert Visitor Center and Rainbow Forest Museum were open from 7a.m. to 7p.m. from May9 through September6 but opened as early as 8a.m. and closed as late as 5p.m. during {{other parts of the}} year. The Painted Desert Inn (a historic museum and bookstore) is open from 9a.m. to 5p.m. year-round except Christmas. Park clocks are always set to Mountain Standard Time, as Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time.|$|E
5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons.</b> Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games {{have been changed}} to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons</b> advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. Salmon {{was the most important}} fish to Willamette River tribes {{as well as to the}} Native Americans of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans. Upper-river tribes caught steelhead and salmon, often by building weirs across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges, practiced slavery, and had a well-defined caste system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling from place to place <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons.</b> They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially camas).|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the village}} of Carabane's {{official}} population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons</b> and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most {{of the population is}} Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée {{at the time of the}} first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.|$|E
