40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} very large-scale neighborhood search (VLSN) techniques in examination timetabling problems. We detail three applications of VLSN algorithms that illustrate the versatility and potential of such algorithms in timetabling. The first of these uses cyclic exchange neighborhoods, in which an ordered subset of exams in disjoint time slots are swapped cyclically such that each exam moves to the time slot of the exam following it in the order. The neighborhood of all such cyclic exchanges may be searched e#ectively for an improving set of moves, making this technique computationally reasonable in practice. <b>We</b> next <b>describ...</b>|$|R
40|$|Micro-credit schemes {{are thought}} to be potent agents of social change in impoverished settings, where women are {{disadvantaged}} by their lack of access to resources. The first experiment with group-based lending was conducted in 1978 in Bangladesh by Grameen Bank; it has proved to be an effective mechanism for extending collateral-free credit and ensuring high repayment rates. In Bangladesh, it is esti-mated that more than 3 million poor women received small loans in mid- 1995 (Sobhan 1995). Programs for similar schemes are expanding rapidly, not only in Bangladesh but also in other developing countries where women are simi-larly disadvantaged. Participation in micro-credit schemes for women can af-fect fertility through a number of mechanisms. To clarify why some of these factors have been proposed, <b>we</b> briefly <b>describ...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the first phase}} of the evolution of the computing environment at Simon Fraser University from a centralized, long established, mainframe based computing environment to a distributed UNIX based computing environment. The first section of the paper gives a brief history of the site and some of the previous initiatives towards distributed computing. The second section {{describes the}} Task Force report that mandated a conversion to UNIX within 9 months and the plan that was developed to do that. The third section details the migration plan versus migration reality. We then extract from this experience the major issues encountered in converting from a mainframe environment to UNIX. We also mention some things that are taken for granted in the mainframe world that don't seem to exist in the UNIX world. This should be of interest to sites planning to convert from a mainframe to UNIX, and to UNIX vendors that are interested in selling machines in that market. <b>We</b> also <b>describ</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} framework for semantic GSM artifacts, discuss in detail its properties, and present main software engineering architectures it {{is able to}} capture. The distinguishing aspect of our framework is that it allows for expressing both the data and the lifecycle schema of GSM artifacts in terms of an ontology, i. e., a shared and for-malized conceptualization of the domain of interest. To guide the modeling of data and lifecycle we provide an upper ontol-ogy, which is specialized in each artifact with specific lifecy-cle elements, relations, and business objects. The framework thus obtained allows to achieve several advantages. On the one hand, it makes the specification of conditions on data and artifact status attribute fully declarative and enables semantic reasoning over them. On the other, it fosters the monitoring of artifacts and the interoperation and cooperation among different artifact systems. To fully achieve such an interoper-ation, we enrich our framework by enabling the linkage of the ontology to autonomous database systems through the use of mappings. We then discuss two scenarios of practical inter-est that show how mappings can be used in the presence of multiple systems. For one of these scenarios <b>we</b> also <b>describ...</b>|$|R

Examples for such requirements include response times, execution rates, and low-level interactions with hardware.

In a distributed system, however, {{there may be}} interaction between multiple instances of many distinct programs, sharing some (but not necessarily all) of their module structure, and with some instances rebuilt with new versions of certain modules as time goes on.
