5|$|Threes! is an indie puzzle {{video game}} by Sirvo, an {{independent}} development team consisting of game designer Asher Vollmer, illustrator Greg Wohlwend, and composer Jimmy Hinson. The game {{was released on}} February 6, 2014, for iOS devices and later ported to Android, Xbox One, and Windows Phone. In Threes, the player slides numbered tiles on a grid to combine addends and multiples of three. The game ends <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> moves left on the grid and the tiles are counted for a final score.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{the other}} majors, the tournament {{consists}} of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (<b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three {{for the first two}} rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament of Canada is the {{legislative}} {{body of the}} Government of Canada. The Parliament is composed of the House of Commons (lower house), the Senate (upper house), and the Sovereign, represented by the Governor General. Most major legislation originates from the House, {{as it is the}} only body that is directly elected. A new parliament begins after an election of the House of Commons and can sit for up to five years. The number of seats in parliament has varied as new provinces joined the country and as population distribution between the provinces changed; there are currently 338 MPs and 105 Senators (<b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> vacancies).|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E

5|$|Nest mate {{recognition}} is widespread in many eusocial insects. However, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> physical differences in either diet or nesting materials, many {{can no longer}} discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics. Recently, however, it has been indicated that many insects {{have the ability to}} discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non-relative counterpart. Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus, former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring. Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives. In Polistes exclamans, it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non-relatives, even having lived in identical environments, is possible. This was found by Allen, Schulze Kellman, and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments. As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased, the more clumps were formed in the box. This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from nonrelative, an adaptive ability in the defense of their nest.|$|E

25|$|Lexical {{modernization}} {{has also}} been critical {{to the development of}} Quechua.

In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.|$|E
