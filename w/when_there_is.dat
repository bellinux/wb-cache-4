5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny.

40|$|Recently (in arXiv {{preprint}} 1703. 08150), Babaioff and Nisan and Talgam-Cohen {{introduced the}} following question. In a Fisher market with indivisible items, {{in which the}} agents' budgets are "generic" (do not satisfy a finite set of linear equalities), does there always exist a competitive equilibrium? For the setting in which agents can have arbitrary monotone preferences over bundles, they provided the following answers: (a) Yes <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> at most 3 items. (b) No <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> at least 5 items. (c) Yes <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 4 items and 2 agents. This note provides the two missing answers: (d) Yes <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 4 items and 3 agents. (e) No <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 4 items and 4 or more agents (even if their valuations are additive). Thus, this note completes the solution for the case of arbitrary monotone preferences. Additionally, for the {{cases in which the}} answer is "Yes", this note presents an implementation of the competitive equilibrium as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of a sequential game...|$|R

5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
