5|$|The Scranton {{general strike}} was a {{widespread}} <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> in 1877 by workers in Scranton, Pennsylvania, {{which took place}} {{as part of the}} Great Railroad Strike, and was the last in a number of violent outbreaks across Pennsylvania. The strike began on July 23 when railroad workers walked off the job in protest of recent wage cuts, and within three days it grew to include perhaps thousands of workers from a variety of industries.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> at pit number six, {{more white}} miners {{assembled}} near the town. They marched to Rock Springs {{by way of}} the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.|$|E
5|$|As the show's revenue {{continued}} to rise through syndication and DVD sales, the main cast stopped appearing for script readings in April 2004. The <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> occurred after weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with Fox, in which the cast asked {{for an increase in}} their pay to $360,000 per episode, or $8 million over a 22-episode season. The strike was resolved a month later and their salary was raised to something between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 <b>work</b> <b>stoppage,</b> the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap. Some young players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter contracts that allowed for more flexibility in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned about the possibility of another <b>work</b> <b>stoppage.</b> A lockout was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season was cut by 16 games.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E

5|$|The dispute {{received}} a tepid response from sports fans, and provoked criticism from media members. It continued into January 1999, threatening {{cancellation of the}} entire season. After division within the players union, however, NBPA executive director Billy Hunter reached an agreement with NBA commissioner David Stern on January 6 to end the <b>work</b> <b>stoppage.</b> Quickly ratified by the owners and players, the deal was signed later in January, ending the lockout after 204 days. The settlement provided for maximum salaries for players and a pay scale for first-year players. In the months after the lockout, television ratings and ticket sales declined during the 50-game season, and both remained below pre-lockout levels in subsequent seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1906–07 was the coldest in Alberta history; this was {{exacerbated}} by {{a shortage of}} coal. One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province. At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company locked out the miners from its mine near Taber. The same company was also facing a <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> at its mine in the Crow's Nest Pass, where miners were refusing to sign a new contract. The problem spread, until by April 22 all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work. Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay; the mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.|$|E
5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping owners would offer better deals if they saw players having more options. Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of getting paid, differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of business travel compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had opt-out clauses that allowed players to return once the <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|E

25|$|The 1872 <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> did {{not result}} in the {{formation}} of police union. Most of the police would not have considered forming a union, as they considered the police a quasi-military institution. Despite the tens of men dismissed after the 1872 strike, members of the Metropolitan Force later took action again. In July 1890 they conducted a <b>work</b> <b>stoppage</b> over low police pensions. The government argued {{that it would not be}} held hostage by their demands, but Parliament passed the Police Pensions Bill (1890) to address inequities, in a matter of weeks.|$|E

25|$|The St. Petersburg {{sanitation}} {{strike of}} 1968 (May 6, 1968 – August 30, 1968) was a labor strike by city sanitation workers in St. Petersburg, Florida that lasted an estimated four months. The strike of 1968 {{was one of}} three labor strikes that took place within three years by city sanitation workers, who cited grievances of pay inequality and poor working conditions. A wage dispute over a newly implemented 48-hour work week triggered the sanitation strike which lasted 116 days. 211 sanitation workers participated in the <b>work</b> <b>stoppage,</b> 210 of whom were African-American.

40|$|Strikes {{were once}} {{considered}} an effective “go to ” {{weapon in the}} labor movement. As union density has declined, so has the frequency and effectiveness of strikes. Strikes were once a tried and true tactic for labor unions to force employers to make concessions at the bargaining table.

This paper examines the new role of public relations campaigns that labor unions employ in bargaining {{as it relates to}} <b>work</b> <b>stoppages.</b> What, if any, pressures do these “corporate campaigns ” exert on employers during <b>work</b> <b>stoppages?</b> Do they help labor unions further their objectives?
