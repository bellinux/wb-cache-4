To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> to see him or shake his hand.|$|E
5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E

For the First Amendment defense, the court held that because Planned Parenthood <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> to restrain Bucci’s usage of their mark as a domain, and not his actual speech, the defense did not apply.|$|E

Hence, the CE allocation must be (6,0);(0,6). The price vector depends on the initial allocation. E.g., if the initial allocation is equal, (3,3);(3,3), then both agents have the same budget in CE, so [...] This CE is essentially unique: the price vector may be multiplied by a constant factor, but the CE equilibrium will not change.|$|R

25|$|The {{shock of}} the {{disaster}} reverberated into every corner of Philip's dominions, loosening everywhere the frayed bonds of his system, and threatening to complete what Essex's successful Cadiz campaign had left undone. After the defeat at Cadiz bankruptcy had stared the King of Spain {{in the face and}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Armada he was forced to suspend payment to creditors. Philip had declared the third major bankruptcy of his reign. Nevertheless, the King desperately <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> a postponement of the Armada not an abandonment and therefore was obliged to borrow yet more money, but this time from his Italian holdings.|$|E

But a public campaign {{led by the}} Conservatives with covert support from First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher, who was a Liberal appointment, forced the government to order eight.

Black workers were told to wash before they interacted with guests. These allegations were denied by the Gupta family. Nonetheless, in the Gupta e-mail leak of 2017 these allegations were shown to be correct. Moreover, the e-mails also make clear that a black worker was called a monkey {{by a member of}} the Gupta family. That the Gupta family is a large, vocal and powerful supporter of the ANC and a personal friend of Jacob Zuma, may explain why no action was taken against them with regards to racism.|$|E

25|$|Banditry was a {{major issue}} in California after 1849, as {{thousands}} of young men detached from family or community moved into a land with few law enforcement mechanisms. To combat this, the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance was established to give drumhead trials and death sentences to well-known offenders. As such, other earlier settlements created their own private agencies to protect communities {{due to the lack of}} peace-keeping establishments. These vigilance committees reflected different occupations in the frontier, such as land clubs, cattlemen's associations and mining camps. Similar vigilance committees also existed in Texas, and their main objective was to stamp out lawlessness and rid communities of desperadoes and rustlers. These committees would sometimes form mob rule for private vigilante groups, but usually were made up of responsible citizens who <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> to maintain order. Criminals caught by these vigilance committees were treated cruelly; often hung or shot without any form of trial.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, April 23, {{the most}} complex and thorny issues were debated. The first {{contentious}} issue on the agenda dealt with natural resources industries, such as the oil, gas, and mines, as it became the centre of a major showdown between the Waffle and the labour movement forces. The Waffle faction wanted total nationalization and public ownership of resource industries. The party establishment, and Labour, being more moderate, <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> to expand public and co-operative ownership. The hour-long debate, quickly transcended into raucous name-calling and physical pushing and shoving at the microphone stands. Sidney Green, Manitoba’s Minister of Mines and Resources in the NDP provincial government, spoke in favour of the moderate resolutions committee motion. He was countered on the convention floor by university professor Peter Usher, a Waffle member from Ottawa, who moved to refer the committee’s motion back for redrafting to push for nationalization of all resource industries. After much heated debate, his motion was defeated in a standing-count vote by a three to one margin. The standing vote was needed because Waffle members challenged two previous voting attempts. Once defeated, the Unity Group, and its labour supporters, pressed for {{the adoption of the}} original eight-point resolution, which then passed easily with a five to one plurality. With the Waffle’s amendment defeated, it seemed unlikely that they could pass other motions that called for the nationalization of other economic sectors like manufacturing, financial, and transportation.|$|E
25|$|Young {{women were}} eager {{to serve in the}} {{military}} during WWII, and the Marine Corps <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> the best. The overall qualifications for women who wished to volunteer for the WR were fairly stringent. The age requirement for officer candidates was between 20 and 49, and a candidate had to be a college graduate or have a combination of two years of college and two years of work experience. The age requirement for those who wished to enlist was between 20 and 35, and candidates had to have completed at least two years of high school. The WR did not accept African American or Japanese American women during World WarII but did accept Native American women. The officer candidates first trained at the Navy's Midshipmen School for women officers located at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. The initial training for enlisted women was held at the Naval Training School at Hunter College in the Bronx, New York City. Soon, the Marine Corps saw the advantage of having its own training schools. Effective 1July 1943, all WR training was to be held at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Members served at shore and air stations across the continental United States, including New York, Chicago, Paris Island, South Carolina, and El Centro and San Diego, California. The territory of Hawaii was the only overseas duty station where members were assigned. They served in occupations classified as professional, semi-professional, clerical, skilled trades, services, and sales. Although the Marine Corps listed more than 200 available job categories, over half of the WR members labored in the clerical field.|$|E

25|$|The Doumanian-era cast faced {{immediate}} {{comparison to}} the beloved former cast and were not received favorably. Ebersol fired the majority of her hires, except for two unknown comedians: Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded {{with him for a}} role on the show, and after seeing him audition, Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of Robert Townsend. Doumanian <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy. Doumanian also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show. Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge, after which Murphy was credited with much of that era's success. Murphy's star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films such as 48 Hrs. and Trading Places, before leaving for his film career in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 1983–84 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material, but at an inflated cost; Billy Crystal and Martin Short were paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode respectively, a far cry from earlier salaries. Michaels' return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established talent such as Robert Downey Jr., Jon Lovitz and Dennis Miller. The season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Learning his lesson from the previous season, Michaels avoided known talent in favor of actual ability. He kept Lovitz, Miller and Nora Dunn, and brought in new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, and Jan Hooks, who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|For his Greenland {{expedition}} of 1888–89 Nansen {{had departed}} from the traditional dependence on large-scale personnel, ships and backup, relying instead on a small well-trained group. [...] Using the same principle for the Fram voyage, Nansen chose a party of just twelve from the thousands of applications that poured {{in from all over}} the world. One applicant was the 20-year-old Roald Amundsen, future conqueror of the South Pole, whose mother stopped him from going.

However, this partition is very inefficient because we could give all the chocolate to one partner and all the vanilla to the other partner, achieving a normalized social welfare of 2.|$|R
