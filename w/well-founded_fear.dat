However, a dogmatic approach to that policy goal may miss the true complexity of both refugee protection and the relationships between a refugee population and a military group. This article examines an alternative possibility, that a non-state armed group may be a potential partner in refugee protection and welfare promotion. It draws on the experiences of refugees from Burma living in camps in Thailand, where there has been a long-standing connection between camp governance structures and a political/military organization movement, the Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army. While camp governance activities have been flawed, they have also displayed a high level of integrity. It is argued that in such a situation, where there is a proven record of working to improve civilian welfare, international organizations might usefully explore possibilities of engagement with non-state armed groups as partners in refugee protection, with the specific goal of encouraging a more representative, accountable, and democratic approach to governance...|$|R
40|$|There are <b>well-founded</b> <b>fears</b> {{that it is}} {{unrealistic}} to expect Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goal 1 (MDG 1) to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger and to halve the proportion of people who suffer hunger by 2015. Recent efforts of African governments to meet the MDG 1 have resulted in a number of initiatives including the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) framework that calls for 6 % agricultural growth rates, the Maputo Declaration calling for 10 % of total public spending to be on agriculture, and the 2006 Abuja Declaration calling for an increase in fertilizer use from 8 – 50 kg/ha by 2015. CAADP estimates that an average investment of US$ 18 billion/year will be required to trigger sufficient agricultural growth rate to meet MDG 1. Meanwhile, budgetary allocation to agriculture in many African nations is low and an analysis of trends in foreign development assistance to Africa over a 10 -year period (1995 - 2004) showed that the annual commitment to agriculture out of the total assistance of US$ 230 billion declined from 11 % in 1995 to 6 % in 2004. This decline could be traced to the frustration of donors and African governments alike at the failure of agriculture to achieve sufficient progress towards food security and poverty reduction. Nevertheless, there is evidence from the past that where projects have been successful, governments provided political leadership and financial support; organized farmers groups actively participated in decision-making; and that close public-private-partnership existed. Based on the lessons learned from previous projects and the subsequent more favorable rules of engagement of donors with beneficiaries, the paper concludes that the challenges and responsibility for getting agriculture back to the front-burner of the development agenda is largely that of African governments.

It is the duty and responsibility of the South African government and international community to provide adequate protection to individuals who are compelled to flee their countries of origin due to <b>well-founded</b> <b>fears</b> of persecution or other life threatening problems. Such protection must meet internationally recognized and acceptable standards for the protection and treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, as outlined in various international law and conventions. South Africa has pledged through her democratic Constitution and the Refugee Act of 1998 to protect and promote the rights of refugees and asylum seekers in her territory. The research explores how South Africa has responded {{to the protection of}} the rights of refugees and asylum seekers in the post-apartheid era. The research also explicates the relationship between human rights and refugee protection and how human rights have been used to facilitate the rights of refugees and asylum seekers in South Africa. The thesis identifies the extent of compliance with the international refugee law, which South Africa has achieved within the first decade of democracy and the roles played by nonstate actors and other stakeholders in refugee protection in South Africa. It also explores the major problems and obstacles militating against the realisation and in pursuit of the rights of refugees and asylum seekers in the post-apartheid South Africa. Finally, the findings of this research are expected to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} problems facing refugees, the government and international community, and the range of options and interventions open to policy makers in the field which will help to secure such rights...|$|R

Our hypothesis is that a change of tendency has taken place in patients with breast cancer in their perspective of the mastectomy, coinciding with the change of century (and millennium), perhaps due to the widespread practice of mammary reconstructive surgery after the resection, which mitigates the trauma (imaginary, symbolic and physical) of the amputation without reconstruction...|$|R

The community is narrowed down to practicing Muslims and three organizations in which Muslims unite. Churches and religious societies have a special status within the civil society due to their missionary work and the content of their religious activities. Do the religious organizations of the Muslim community stand on the verge of the civil society or do they strive for cooperation with the major public within the frame of common activities? Czech society fears this minority due to a negative media picture of Muslims. Are those <b>fears</b> <b>well-founded</b> and can the religious community change this way of perceiving them? This negative perception can relate to an insufficient integration process which I also target in my thesis.

40|$|The worst {{crime against}} working {{people is a}} company which fails to operate at a profit. ” —Samuel Gompers, founder, American Federation of Labor The most {{prominent}} fear employers voice regarding unionization {{is that it will}} drive them out of business. But is that <b>fear</b> <b>well-founded?</b> This brief summarizes recent research showing that unionization simply does not cause firm failure: firms that become unionized are no more likely to fail than comparable firms that remain nonunion. This finding may surprise some readers. Because unions clearly do aim to give workers a larger share of the benefits of economic growth, the possibility does exist that if they succeed in transferring income to workers and away from profits, then a firm’s solvency could conceivably be threatened. However, {{it is also possible that}} even unions that successfully redistribute income from profits to wages can coexist with firms that remain viable over the long run. Only the most simple-minded and unrealistic economic models argue that there is an inexorable link between any such redistribution and a firm’s death. Recent research has been able to make convincing claims about the causal impact of unions winning recognition through an election certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on the subsequent survival of the newly unionized firms. This research provides evidence that this causal effect of union recognition is zero and has been zero since at least the 1960 s, which is how far back we T a b l e o f C o n t e n t s can go with the available data.

No fire was there, however, and no fuel laid ready to light; the lace-mender was unable to allow herself that indulgence, especially now when, deprived by death of her sole relative, she had only her own unaided exertions to rely on. Frances went into an inner room to take off her bonnet, and she came out a model of frugal neatness, with her well-fitting black stuff dress, so accurately defining her elegant bust and taper waist, with her spotless white collar turned back from a fair and shapely neck, with her plenteous brown hair arranged in smooth bands on her temples, and in a large Grecian plait behind: ornaments she had none--neither brooch, ring, nor ribbon; she did well enough without them--perfection of fit, proportion of form, grace of carriage, agreeably supplied their place. Her eye, as she re-entered the small sitting-room, instantly sought mine, which was just then lingering on the hearth; I knew she read at once the sort of inward ruth and pitying pain which the chill vacancy of that hearth stirred in my soul: quick to penetrate, quick to determine, and quicker to put in practice, she had in a moment tied a holland apron round her waist; then she disappeared, and reappeared with a basket; it had a cover; she opened it, and produced wood and coal; deftly and compactly she arranged them in the grate.|$|R
