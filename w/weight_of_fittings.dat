This type of loads act throughout {{the life cycle}} of pipe. These Loads cause bending and the bending moment is related to normal and shear stresses. Pipe bending is caused mainly due to two reasons : distributed weight load (e.g. fluid weight) and concentrated weight load (e.g. valve weight).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for {{frequency}} estimation of irregularly sampled data is proposed. In {{comparison with the}} previous sparsity-based methods where the sparsity constraint is applied to a least-squares fitting problem, the proposed method {{is based on a}} sparsity constrained weighted least-squares problem. The resulting problem is solved in an iterative manner, allowing the usage of the solution obtained at each iteration to determine the <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> the least-squares <b>fitting</b> term at the next iteration. Such an appropriate <b>weighting</b> <b>of</b> the least-squares <b>fitting</b> term enhances the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results verify that the proposed method can detect the spectral peaks using a very short data record. Compared to the previous one, the proposed method is less probable to miss the actual spectral peaks and exhibit spurious peaks...|$|R
40|$|Study of inter-system biases(ISB) is {{essential}} for the data processing of multi-constellation precise point positioning(PPP). When establishing BDS/GPS short-term ISB models, as equal-weight least square(LS) fails in taking the different <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> ISB data into consideration, a method based on Kalman filter is proposed for the parameter estimation of ISB modelling, and the variance <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> ISB data in Kalman filter is adjusted according to the distance between the data time and the forecast time. ISB models are established with ISB data over 7 days and the accuracy and applicability of ISB prediction for the 8 th day is verified by static PPP experiments. The analysis result shows that the accuracy of ISB prediction generated by Kalman filter model is 29. 7 %, 11. 5 %, 43. 5 % and 32. 0 % higher than those generated by LS model at 4 stations, respectively. With the priori constraints of ISB prediction generated by Kalman filter model, the averaged RMS values of static PPP solutions are promoted by 2. 7 % and 0. 9 % higher in E and U components than those with priori constraints generated by LS model, and are promoted by 10. 6 %, 26. 3 % and 3. 4 % higher in E, N, U components than those without priori constraints, respectively...|$|R

50|$|As the Sherman {{was being}} designed, {{provisions}} were made so that multiple types of main armament (specified as a 75 mm gun, a 3-inch gun, or a 105 mm howitzer) could be {{mounted in the}} turret. The possibility of mounting the main gun of the M6 heavy tank, the 3-inch gun M7, in the turret of the M4 Sherman was explored first. As this gun was developed from a land-based antiaircraft gun, the size and <b>weight</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> it into a tank's turret were of secondary concern. As a result, {{it was found that}} the gun was too large to fit in the turret of the Sherman. Development on a new 76 mm gun better-suited to the Sherman began in 1942.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{interpretation}} of φ-values {{has led to}} an understanding of the folding transition state ensemble of a variety of proteins. Although the main guidelines and equations for calculating φ are well established, there remains some controversy about the quality of the numerical values obtained. By analyzing a complete set of results from kinetic experiments with the SH 3 domain of α-spectrin (Spc-SH 3) and applying classical error methods and error-propagation formulas, we evaluated the uncertainties involved in two-state-folding kinetic experimental parameters and the corresponding calculated φ-values. We show that kinetic constants in water and m values can be properly estimated from a judicious <b>weighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> errors and describe some procedures to calculate the errors in Gibbs energies and φ-values from a traditional two-point Leffler analysis. Furthermore, on the basis of general assumptions made with the protein engineering method, we show how to generate multipoint Leffler plots via the analysis of pH dependencies of kinetic parameters. We calculated the definitive φ-values for a collection of single mutations previously designed to characterize the folding transition state of the α-spectrin SH 3 domain. The effectiveness of the pH-scanning procedure is also discussed in the context of error analysis. Judging from the magnitudes of the error bars obtained from two-point and multipoint Leffler plots, we conclude that the precision obtained for φ-values should be ∼ 25 %, a reasonable limit that takes into account the propagation of experimental errors...|$|R

S. Army capabilities. This thesis identifies several problems with using AHP. Most significantly, AHP can cause rank reversal of alternatives if a new alternative is considered, even if the new alternative has the same attribute levels {{as one of the}} previous alternatives. This thesis proposes several modifications that would improve results when AHP is used. It contains a different method <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> <b>fitting</b> that appears to provide alternative weights that are more accurate than the traditional AHP eigenvalue method. This thesis has two proposals for improving the nine point integer scale by which pairwise comparisons are made. Most significantly, this thesis proposes a modification to AHP that will maintain a ratio scale and avoid rank reversals. This last improvement requires the decision maker to establish and maintain units of measurement. Additionally, the decision maker must make comparisons of attributes to establish a meaningful scale not sensitive to the abundance or lack of alternatives considered. If units are maintained and the decision maker is consistent in the pairwise comparisons, there will be no rank reversals[URL] United States Arm...|$|R
