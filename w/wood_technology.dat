40|$|One of the {{emerging}} advanced engineered <b>wood</b> <b>technologies</b> in the United States and other countries {{is the use of}} high strength fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) to reinforce the tension zone of structural glued laminated timber (glulam). Glulam is used in numerous long-span commercial building applications where the glulam is exposed for architectural reasons. For some occupancy use classifications, the U. S. building code mandates that these exposed glulam members be rated for one-hour fire construction. The most structurally efficient use of FRP reinforcement is to place the FRP on the outermost face of the glulam member. However, there is no published information on how a glulam beam reinforced in this manner will perform when directly exposed to fire...|$|R
