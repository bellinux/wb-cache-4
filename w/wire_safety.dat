50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>wire</b> tabs are washers {{that are}} used to secure {{fasteners}} by transferring the force of the <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> {{to the head of the}} fastener to be secured. They are installed just like any other washer, after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> is threaded. Once the <b>Safety</b> <b>Wire</b> is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> to the fastener, as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> run though it.|$|R

50|$|When {{drilling}} a fastener, {{the choice}} of where to drill {{it depends on the}} type of fastener and to what it will be wired.

50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>wire</b> or locking-wire {{is a type}} of {{positive}} locking device that prevents fasteners from loosening or falling out due to vibration and other forces.

50|$|Safety {{cable is}} an {{alternative}} to safety <b>wire.</b> <b>Safety</b> cable {{is defined as a}} group of strands right-hand helically twisted without a core. This eliminates the need for twisting during installation, as is required with safety wire. Several companies manufacture safety cable, and it is becoming an industry standard due to easier control of critical inputs and reduced installation time. Installation and quality requirements of safety cable are governed by SAE AS4536.|$|E
50|$|Although many systems {{purport to}} be more {{efficient}} than installing traditional <b>safety</b> <b>wire,</b> an advantageous by-product of the twisting method of installing <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> is that it leaves a highly visible and easily inspectable indication that the fasteners in question are in fact properly secured.|$|R

Wires and electrical cables are specified according to the circuit operating voltage and electric current capability, with further restrictions on the environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature range, moisture levels, and exposure to sunlight and chemicals. Associated circuit protection, control and distribution devices within a building's wiring system are subject to voltage, current and functional specification.

50|$|The {{shaft and}} {{foundations}} of surface infrastructure are on land in between Anne and Park Streets with access via Park Street. Of significance {{here is the}} shaft, with {{the remnants of a}} brick exhaust chimney {{on the rim of the}} shaft, and the large concrete and brick remains of machinery and building foundations. The shaft is open and well defined to a depth of 2,552 ft and is enclosed by a 14m x 14m chain <b>wire</b> <b>safety</b> fence. The land surrounding the shaft is flat with no evidence of mullock heaps.|$|E
50|$|The shaft {{is located}} {{close to the}} western side of Upper Deane Street, on vacant land. It is {{surrounded}} by a 10m x 6m chain <b>wire</b> <b>safety</b> fence and is visible from the street. The shaft opening is 3m across with a predominantly rock collar. The eastern and northern side of the shaft openings however, show some small evidence of collapse in recent times. The ground within the fence is lightly grassed and free of debris. There are no other mine remains in evidence but evidence of the tramway which connected this, the No.2 and no.3 shafts of the Day Block and Wyndham Co. to the main railway lines lies beside the shaft.|$|E
50|$|The shaft is {{open and}} well defined behind a chain <b>wire</b> <b>safety</b> fence (14m x 14m) that was erected in the late 1960s by the Charters Towers City Council. A {{temporary}} wire chain safety fence {{has been placed on}} the eastern side presumably to render safe this side from subsidence. The shaft {{is open and}} intact. 50 metres to the south-west is a brick magazine. Substantial foundations for mine machinery associated with the mine lie to the north. The Day Dawn PC No. 4 is in evidence to the east as has a temporary safety fence around it. The USL on which the shaft lies is heavily grassed and is generally clear of other built or natural features.|$|E

5000|$|A foxhole {{radio is}} a {{makeshift}} radio that {{was first used}} by soldiers in World War II, specifically at Anzio, spreading later across the European and Pacific theaters. There were {{different versions of the}} foxhole radio; all used a safety razor blade as a radio wave detector. The [...] "classic" [...] foxhole radio was configured like a crystal radio, with the blade acting as the crystal and a <b>wire,</b> <b>safety</b> pin, or, later, a pencil serving as the cat's whisker. Other versions were similar to the microphone detector of David Edward Hughes, rediscovered by Harry Shoemaker and Walter Wentworth Massie, popular among amateurs {{in the early days of}} radio. They were named, likely by the press, for the foxhole, a defensive fighting position developed before and during the war.|$|E
50|$|The shaft {{is located}} on the {{southern}} side of Towers Hill with access via Chloride Street. The shaft lies at the intersection of upper Chloride Street and Percy Street but as both of these streets are unformed, access to the shaft is through open bush commencing from the private road to the Microwave Repeater Station. The shaft itself is open and well defined behind a chain <b>wire</b> <b>safety</b> fence (14m x 14m). The opening to the shaft is 6m x 4m wide and is filled with water to approximately 1.5m from the surface. Within the fence there are the remains of one of the mine's head frame leg footings, and outside the fence on the eastern side are some small mullock heaps. Remains of concrete foundations are found scattered around the shaft, but none are intact.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on <b>safety</b> <b>wire</b> at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as <b>safety</b> <b>wire,</b> which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R
