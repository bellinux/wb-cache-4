5|$|After {{his playing}} career, McBride retired to Florissant, Missouri, where he briefly owned a liquor store. He <b>was</b> <b>enjoying</b> {{the time he}} could spend with his family, but the New York Mets called him with a {{coaching}} opportunity.

In the 1990s, McBride was a minor league hitting coach for the Cardinals.|$|E

5000|$|Some things <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> <b>enjoyed</b> (in Latin, frui), {{and others}} are to be used (uti). Things we <b>enjoy</b> <b>are</b> those we find good in themselves, and things we use {{are those that are}} good for the sake of {{something}} else. The only thing that <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>is</b> God. All other things, including other human beings, are to be used in relation to the proper end of enjoyment. To use something which <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>enjoyed</b> or vice versa is to fail to love properly. [...] The discussion of enjoyment and use leads to an extended reflection on motivation, word as flesh, and humanity as image of God.|$|R

On September 15, 2012, Kane signed a six-year, $31.5 million contract extension with the Jets.|$|E
5|$|In 1214 John {{began his}} final {{campaign}} to reclaim Normandy from Philip. John was optimistic, {{as he had}} successfully built up alliances with the Emperor Otto, Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders; he <b>was</b> <b>enjoying</b> papal favour; and he had successfully built up substantial funds {{to pay for the}} deployment of his experienced army. Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps. John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by William Longespée, marched south-west from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Henri Théodore Pigozzi {{was looking to}} expand the {{manufacturing}} operations of his Simca company, which <b>was</b> <b>enjoying</b> much success at the time, thanks to the popular Aronde. At the same time, Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to Paris, {{where it had been}} manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette. The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion. The Vedette was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided to take over the entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there.|$|E

Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined to join the sessions as he <b>was</b> <b>enjoying</b> success with the Bill Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially told {{they were going to}} play on a Jim Reeves session. RCA executives Sholes and Bill Bullock were joined in the control booth by Parker, his assistant Tom Diskin, A head Chet Atkins, engineer Bill Porter and Hill and Range's Bienstock.|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve <b>was</b> <b>enjoying</b> an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|By 1875, France <b>was</b> <b>enjoying</b> {{improved}} {{political stability}} and a recovering postwar economy. Growing {{interest in the}} upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide {{it was time to}} seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty Enlightening the World. The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, {{if for no other reason}} than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde, the French version of the statue's announced name.|$|E

5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, but he soon moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother <b>was</b> <b>enjoying</b> great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E
