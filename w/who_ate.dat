5|$|Loring {{also was}} built with a non-denominational chapel, which helped to welcome new members onto the base. Services were offered {{to those of}} the Roman Catholic, Protestant denominations, and Judaic faiths. Members of the chapel also {{provided}} food for those <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> in Loring's dining hall, and helped to share the word of God to those who were believers.|$|E
5|$|The puffball is edible {{when the}} gleba is still firm and white. They are {{reportedly}} {{consumed by the}} tribal people of Madhya Pradesh. In Mexico, a large collection was consumed by several people who confused the species with Calvatia, a puffball genus containing popular edible members. Of the five <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> the fungus, two had gastrointestinal symptoms including stomachache, flatulence, and diarrhea; the other three did not have symptoms. The large European bird great bustard (Otis tarda) has been recorded feeding on the puffball.|$|E

Cæteris paribus, the man <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> much is a better Christian than the man <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> little, and he <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> little will pursue a more uninterrupted course of benevolence than he <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> nothing.

5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} on whether eating prior to a cognitive recall test can affect cognitive functioning. One example was {{a study of the}} effect of breakfast timing on selected cognitive functions of elementary school students. Their results found that children <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> breakfast at school scored notably higher on most of the cognitive tests than did students <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> breakfast at home and also children who did not eat breakfast at all.|$|E
25|$|People <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> {{the most}} subsidized food had a 37% {{higher risk of}} being obese {{compared}} to people <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> {{the least amount of}} subsidized food. This brings up the concern that minority communities are more prone to risks of obesity due to financial limitations. What the government subsidies results in those commodities being cheap to the public, however what is recommended by the dietary guidelines are foods that are made unaffordable.|$|E

50|$|Iran - In Persian culture, {{children}} who misbehave may be told {{by their parents}} {{to be afraid of}} lulu (لولو) <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> up the naughty children. Lulu is usually called lulu-khorkhore (bogeyman <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> everything up). The threat is generally used to make small children eat their meals.|$|R
25|$|Children's {{food choices}} are also {{influenced}} by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that {{four out of five}} parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> three or fewer meals per week, those <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> six to seven family meals per week, compared to those <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents {{are more likely to be}} obese as adults than those raised by their parents. An American study released in 2011 found the more mothers work the more children are more likely to be overweight or obese.|$|E

5000|$|The example’s first {{premise is}} false - {{there are people}} <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> carrots <b>who</b> are not quarterbacks - but the {{conclusion}} would necessarily be true, if the premises were true. In other words, {{it is impossible for}} the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is “valid”, but not “sound”. False generalizations - such as [...] "Everyone <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> carrots is a quarterback" [...] - are often used to make unsound arguments. The fact that there are some people <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> carrots but are not quarterbacks proves the flaw of the argument.|$|R
25|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Man <b>Who</b> <b>Ate</b> The Man are more poetic than rock'n'roll inspired, and concern city {{relationships}} (Benny's Insobriety and Without Word) or similar, but {{set against a}} rural backdrop (A Sad Ha Ha (Circled My Demise) and The Only Witching You'll be Doing). The themes explore control, loss, reverence, worth, relationship-pacts.|$|E

25|$|Cannibalism {{has also}} been implicated as a {{transmission}} mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as kuru, once found primarily among women and children of the Fore people in Papua New Guinea.

25|$|Vegetarians may {{avoid the}} {{negative}} {{health effects of}} processed red meat: A 1999 meta-study of five studies comparing vegetarian and non-vegetarian mortality rates in Western countries found that in comparison with regular meat eaters, mortality from ischemic heart disease was 34% lower in people <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> fish but not meat (pescetarians), 34% lower in ovo-lacto vegetarians, 26% lower in vegans and 20% lower in occasional meat eaters.
