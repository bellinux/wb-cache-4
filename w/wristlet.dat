25|$|Joplin's body art, with a <b>wristlet</b> {{and a small}} {{heart on}} her left breast, by the San Francisco tattoo artist Lyle Tuttle, was an early moment in the popular culture's {{acceptance}} of tattoos as art. Another trademark was her flamboyant hair styles, which often included colored streaks, and accessories such as scarves, beads, and feathers. When in New York City, Joplin, often {{in the company of}} actor Michael J. Pollard, frequented Limbo on St. Mark's Place. Joplin, well known to the boutique's employees, made a practice of putting aside vintage and other one-of-a-kind garments she favored on stage and off.|$|E
500|$|The company H. Williamson Ltd., {{based in}} Coventry, {{was one of}} the first to {{capitalize}} on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 AGM it was noted that [...] "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a <b>wristlet</b> watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." [...] By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British Horological Journal wrote in 1917 that [...] "...the <b>wristlet</b> watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." [...] Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{acceptance}} of <b>wristlets</b> by men {{serving in the}} military was not widespread, though: <b>Wristlets,</b> as they were called, were reserved for women, and considered more of a passing fad than a serious timepiece.

Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is flung open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an ape's gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces {{dangling}} at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims {{the light of the}} chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral <b>wristlet,</b> a chain purse in her hand, sits {{perched on the edge of}} the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece.

50|$|A <b>wristlet</b> {{is often}} the first item used to {{actually}} perform the rescue, {{as opposed to the}} ventilator which is used to prepare the environment for a rescue. A <b>wristlet</b> is a cloth strap that is used to cinch tightly around the wrist or ankle of an incapacitated person. Once the strap is looped around a hand or foot, its attached rope is pulled by rescuers, tightening around the arm or leg and pulling the victim out of the confined space.|$|E
