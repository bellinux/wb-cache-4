5|$|Rudolf Höss, commandant of Auschwitz, {{said that}} the use of Zyklon-B to kill prisoners came about on the {{initiative}} of one of his subordinates, SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) Karl Fritzsch, who used the substance to kill some Russian POWs in late August 1941 in the basement of Block 11 in the main camp. The experiment was repeated on more Russian POWs, with Höss <b>watching,</b> <b>in</b> September. Block 11 proved unsuitable for mass killings, as the basement was difficult to air out afterwards and the crematorium (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942) was some distance away. The site of the killings was moved to Crematorium I, where more than 700 victims could be killed at once. By the middle of 1942, the operation was moved to Auschwitz II–Birkenau, a nearby satellite camp which had been under construction since October 1941.|$|E

25|$|Another {{flagship}} programme, {{the long-running}} quiz show, University Challenge was originally aired between 1962 and 1987. It was revived by the BBC in 1994 (produced by Granada). The company produced The Krypton Factor, between 1977 and 1995 (revived by ITV in 2009). One of Granada's longest-running programmes, What The Papers Say, was broadcast by Granada in 1956, {{was taken over}} by the BBC in the early 1990s, and was shown by Channel 4. The programme introduced the idea of discussing what the newspapers were reporting, continued by Sunday Supplement and The Wright Stuff. In the 1970s, Granada produced situation comedies, often based around life in the north west including Nearest and Dearest, The Lovers and The Cuckoo Waltz, followed by Brothers McGregor and <b>Watching</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Park also notched up {{some fine}} {{performances}} for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920–1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He {{was said to}} have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have got any sleep before his debut. He never played Test cricket again. Legend has it that his wife, who was <b>watching</b> <b>in</b> the stands, dropped her knitting as he prepared to face his first ball, bent down to retrieve it at the moment of delivery, and thus missed his entire Test career.|$|E
25|$|Huxley {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} to spend {{a year at the}} Naples Marine Biological Station where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating sea squirts and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds such as the common redshank (a wader) and grebes (which are divers). Bird <b>watching</b> <b>in</b> childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the great crested grebe, later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.|$|E

25|$|The show {{initially}} starred Hodgson as Joel Robinson, {{a janitor}} trapped {{against his will}} by two mad scientists on the Satellite of Love and forced to watch a series of B movies {{as a part of}} the scientists' plot to take over the world. To keep his sanity, Joel crafts a number of robot companions—including Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy—to keep him company and help him humorously comment on each movie as it plays, a process known as riffing. Each two-hour episode would feature a single movie in its entirety along with associated public domain films, with Joel, Tom, and Crow <b>watching</b> <b>in</b> silhouette from a row of theater seats at the bottom of the screen. These scenes were framed with interstitial sketches. The show's cast changed over its duration; most notably, the character of Joel was replaced by Mike Nelson (played by Michael J. Nelson) in the show's fifth season. Other cast members, most of whom were also writers for the show, include Trace Beaulieu, Josh Weinstein, Jim Mallon, Kevin Murphy, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, Bill Corbett, Paul Chaplin, and Bridget Jones Nelson. The revival features a primarily new cast, including Jonah Ray as the new human test subject, along with Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt.|$|E
