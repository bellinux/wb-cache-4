Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>on</b> {{issues such as the}} Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he {{thought he was going to}} die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} public roles Walton {{performed}} {{in the first few}} months of the Kennedy administration was redecorating the White House. Walton advised Jacqueline Kennedy on the building's decor, and helped redecorate the Oval Office with sculpture and paintings. Although Walton differed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>on</b> political issues−he was an early opponent of the Vietnam War−the Kennedys enjoyed his company immensely. The Kennedys invited Walton to spend their first White House Thanksgiving day with them in 1961.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, unionists were {{concerned}} about the continued presence of U.S. forces at Fort Sumter despite assurances communicated informally to them by U.S. Secretary of State William Seward that it would be abandoned. Lincoln and Seward were also concerned that the Virginia convention was still in session as of the first of April while secession sentiment was growing. At Lincoln's invitation, unionist John B. Baldwin of Augusta County met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>on</b> April 4. Baldwin explained that the unionists needed the evacuation of Fort Sumter, a national convention to debate the sectional differences, and a commitment by Lincoln to support constitutional protections for southern rights. Over Lincoln's skepticism, Baldwin argued that Virginia would be out of the Union within forty-eight hours if either side fired a shot at the fort. By some accounts, Lincoln offered to evacuate Fort Sumter if the Virginia convention would adjourn.|$|E
25|$|When the Board {{issued its}} {{recommendations}} on March 20, 1952, it triggered a crisis {{which led to}} seizure of the nation's steel mills. The decision to give the workers a 26 cent-an-hour raise (which included bringing their pensions to parity with workers in other industries) was largely seen as an overly-generous award {{as well as a}} union victory. Although he had been bypassed by the procedures of E.O. 10233, Wilson decided to intervene in the dispute to avoid having the terms of the recommendation accepted. He met with Putnam and Arnall on March 21 and informed them he would be involved in the steel industry labor dispute personally. Wilson then traveled to Key West, Florida, to meet with a vacationing Truman. Believing he had won Truman's consent to reduce the wage recommendation, Wilson subsequently denounced the WSB recommendation and sponsored a number of collective bargaining sessions between the parties over the next few days. An angry Putnam and his deputies met with Wilson on March 27. Wilson Putnam, and his deputies then met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>on</b> March 28, at which time Putnam told Truman that the WSB recommendations met wage stabilization goals and that Wilson's actions were inappropriate. Truman agreed; Wilson resigned. John R. Steelman, Assistant to the President of the United States (a position which later became the White House Chief of Staff), was named interim director of the Office of Defense Mobilization on March 30. Negotiations between Steelman's staff, employers and the union unraveled over the next seven days, and the union announced it would strike on April 9. In a nationally televised address at 10:30p.m. Eastern time on April 8, President Truman announced that he was seizing the nation's steel mills under his authority as commander-in-chief. The steelmakers sued to regain control of their property.|$|E
500|$|Months {{prior to}} his announcement, McCarthy hinted that he would {{challenge}} President Johnson for the Democratic nomination due to his contrasting views <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>on</b> the Vietnam War. The Americans for Democratic Action announced that they would support McCarthy's campaign if he decided to run. [...] Johnson took these mentions seriously, privately confiding to Democratic congressional leaders that McCarthy could gain the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, splintering the party. It was rumored that McCarthy had $100,000 pledged to use on the New Hampshire and Wisconsin primaries in the upcoming year. One politician explained to Johnson that McCarthy's run could be reminiscent of Estes Kefauver, whose 1952 campaign in the early primaries is speculated to have caused President Harry S. Truman to not seek re-election. McCarthy privately explained his intentions to Vice President Hubert Humphrey {{with whom he had}} served Minnesota in the Senate for nearly two decades. He commented that he did not believe he could win, but that he had [...] "lost interest" [...] in the Senate and felt [...] "very strongly about the war," [...] believing {{that the best way to}} express himself was to [...] "go on out and enter the primaries." [...] Humphrey stated that McCarthy was [...] "more vain and arrogant than his supporters wanted to admit", but that he did not decide to run for president because of his personal feelings for Johnson, but his genuine feelings about the Vietnam War.|$|E

Three of Mullan's Senate supporters then met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>on</b> the morning of March 5 to advocate for his appointment. [...] But Wallace was a friend of Lincoln's, and he, too, had been lobbying for the position and collecting letters of recommendation. Mullan was a Democrat, and Wallace a Republican. Lincoln nominated Wallace as the first Territorial Governor of Idaho Territory, and the Senate approved the nomination on March 10.|$|E
2500|$|In one of {{the last}} major speeches of his presidency, Obama {{strongly}} endorsed Clinton as the nominee, saying [...] "there has never been a man or woman more qualified than Hillary Clinton." [...] Obama contrasted his and Clinton's hopeful view of America with that of Trump, which he called [...] "deeply pessimistic". Obama argued that Trump is unqualified for the office, and is attempting to use fear to get elected. Michael Grunwald of Politico called it a [...] "stirring but fundamentally defensive speech". Conservative blogger Erick Erickson tweeted [...] "I disagree <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>on</b> so much policy and his agenda, but appreciate the hope and optimism in this speech." [...] After the speech, Clinton appeared on the stage {{for the first time in}} the convention, embracing her 2008 primary rival.|$|E
