5|$|Three {{years after}} the {{toppling}} of the Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in October 1917, the Red Army invaded the southern Caucasus republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. In May 1920, Bagramyan, upset with the country's social and political conditions, participated in a failed rebellion against the Dashnak-led government of Armenia. He was jailed and sent to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with {{the outbreak of the}} Turkish–Armenian War. But in December 1920, Armenia was sovietized and the national army was subsequently disbanded. Bagramyan, however, chose to join the 11th Soviet Army and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander.|$|E
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed {{its role as}} an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became {{the basis of the}} Great Leap Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E

25|$|Along with scriptural arguments, Leila Ahmed {{argues that}} head {{covering}} {{should not be}} compulsory in Islam because the veil predates the revelation of the Qur'an.

25|$|In former times, {{there was}} only one main meal, a midday meal cooked in an earth oven. Villagers would rise, eat some {{leftover}} food from the previous day's meal, and set out to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> fishing, gathering shellfish, etc. The results of the morning's work would be cooked by the men, and served to the assembled household. The remnants would be placed in a basket suspended from a tree. This food is served as an end-of-the-day snack as well as the next day's breakfast. Food past its prime was given to the pigs.|$|E
25|$|In pre-contact Tonga, {{women did}} not do the cooking (cooking in an earth oven was hard, hot work, the {{province}} of men) or <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> They raised children, gathered shellfish on the reef, and made koloa, barkcloth and mats, which were a traditional form of wealth exchanged at marriages and other ceremonial occasions. An industrious woman thus raised the social status of her household. Her family also slept soundly, on the piles of mats and barkcloth that were the traditional bedding. On sunny days, these were spread on the grass to air, which prolonged their life.|$|E
25|$|Pascal's <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of {{the study}} of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics {{centered}} on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up {{to the level of the}} third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment.|$|E
