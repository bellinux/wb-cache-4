5|$|Albinism <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) {{along the}} {{coastline}} {{of the southern}} Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E

5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, {{with only}} the tarsus and tail {{as well as some}} undertail {{feathers}} being black. It was not an albino as its skin seemed to have had the normal, dark color and {{it was part of a}} flock of some twenty normally plumaged individuals.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the South China Sea on August15. It moved northwestward and struck the Leizhou Peninsula in southern China on August18. The storm {{turned to the}} west and crossed the northern Gulf of Tonkin, hitting northern Vietnam and dissipating on August20. Another storm was first detected northeast of Luzon on August21. A northwest trajectory brought the system through the Ryukyu Islands, and the storm ultimately dissipated over eastern China on August24, having moved ashore near Wenzhou.|$|E
5|$|An ephemeral/fluctuating pool natural {{community}} {{known as}} the Edgewood Vernal Pools is located on and near Nescopeck Mountain. It consists of dozens of vernal pools created by glaciation. Numerous amphibian species breed in the pools and hardwood trees and hemlock are present on {{the southern edge of}} the pool system. A globally rare species of invertebrate <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the pools in 1990.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of model}} pressure vessel steels {{has been characterized}} after neutron irradiation and thermal aging by atom probe field-ion microscopy. A high density of small, roughly spherical or disc shaped copper clusters/precipitates <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the neutron irradiated alloys that contained copper. Small spherical phosphorus clusters <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the irradiated copper-free alloys, and copper phosphides <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> a high phosphorus Fe-Cu-Ni-P alloy. None of these clusters/precipitates <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the thermally aged materials. The increases in the tensile and yield strengths that <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> after neutron irradiation resulted from the formation of these clusters and other lattice defects...|$|R
5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{methylation}} of the EFS CpG island <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 69% {{of cases}} of uveal melanoma (UM) and only UM with EFS methylation gave rise to metastases. RT-PCR expression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between EFS mRNA expression with EFS methylation in UM.

5|$|In early August, a {{disturbance}} <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> satellite images moving {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 4. Moving westward along the Intertropical Convergence Zone at a forward speed of roughly , the disturbance showed no signs of development until a cloud mass broke away from the ITCZ on August 6. The separated mass began rapidly organizing, becoming Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. The tropical depression continued to gain organization and was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 8, receiving the name Cora.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{apparent}} immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear. In 185 AD, {{they were the first}} to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the black catbird. Its breeding season appears to run from spring through summer; nest building <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> Belize in early May, and small young were found in a nest in Mexico in mid-August. The nest, an open cup of twigs lined with rootlets and other fine material, is placed low in a dense bush or small tree. The female lays two greenish-blue eggs.

5|$|On June15, a {{tropical}} wave with associated instability <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It {{moved into the}} central Gulf of Mexico on June16, {{and the next day}} developed a weak circulation {{at the same time that}} Tropical Storm Beulah was on the other side of the gulf.

Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli, {{also known}} as Durrell's vontsira, is a Madagascan mammal in the family Eupleridae of the order Carnivora. It is most {{closely related to the}} brown-tailed {{mongoose}} (Salanoia concolor), with which it forms the genus Salanoia. The two are genetically similar, but morphologically distinct, leading scientists to recognize them as separate species. After an individual <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 2004, the animal became known to science and S.durrelli was described as a new species in 2010. It is found only in the Lac Alaotra area.|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the North Atlantic. This {{technique}} {{involves the}} whale slapping {{the surface of}} the ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a {{small lake}} that <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> Arenas' crater {{several months before}} the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.|$|E
