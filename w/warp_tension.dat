40|$|The weaving {{process is}} {{substantially}} {{influenced by the}} <b>warp</b> thread <b>tension.</b> In order to obtain good fabric quality at a smooth run of the loom, the optimisation of the <b>warp</b> thread <b>tension</b> is necessary. The tension is influenced by a multitude of parameters, especially the back shedding geometry. The pure analytical determination of the best back shedding geometry is not possible. The experimental determination of the best loom setting takes up {{a great deal of}} time and is only an approximation. This complex task occurs particularly with new products, for which the user has not established machine settings yet. Within the framework of the presented thesis the development of a technical system is presented that provides optimised machine settings based on machine and fabric specific data and with help of mathematic methods and simulations. Neural networks have been trained and tested for the prediction of ideal article and machine specific <b>warp</b> thread <b>tension</b> sequences (comparison tension sequences) based on empiric data of weaving mills. For that the necessary product, machine and operational data was collected on very well adjusted weaving machines with satisfactory processing performance and fabric quality over a long time period. This data has been analysed by special mathematic methods. The determination of the machine setting from the tension sequence is not possible directly. Because of that the optimisation algorithm of the AUTO-WARP-concept, that has been developed at the Institut für Textiltechnik der RWTH Aachen (ITA), is used. According to the principle of evolution strategy and based on fabric and machine data, the comparison tension sequence and by the help of a special simulation program of the ITA for <b>warp</b> thread <b>tension</b> sequences the fabric and machine specific optimised machine setting is calculated. For an easy operation the various described components have been put together to one program and a common user interface was created to achieve a simple data input according to the demand of a weaving mill. The developed system was tested in practise for the product family of aramid yarns. In the practise test the developed adjustment device was able to determine good and very good machine settings for new products and machines, although the test fabric was far out of the training product spectrum. With the recommended loom setting the <b>warp</b> thread <b>tension</b> sequence, the run of the loom and the fabric quality were improved clearly. The adjustment device is a tool for the weaver that makes a good and quick fabric specific adjustment of the back shedding possible even for new fabrics. By this it enable the weaver to reduce material, machine and personal costs and to improve the fabric quality. The program is simple to operate and runs on usual personal computers. In order to use the system for new product families the neural networks have to be trained with corresponding data. This further conversion and marketing strategies are viewed finally...|$|R
40|$|Loom Speed and Tension to Reduce Warp and Weft Breaks in Air Jet Weaving is a {{published}} article of the Textile Technology department. The {{study sought to}} identify correct values of loom speed and <b>warp</b> <b>tension</b> suitable for weaving 100 % cotton yarn on Dornier double beam Air Jet Looms, AWSE 2 /E type. The causes of warp breaks are, poor quality yarn, uncontrolled temperature and humidity, uncontrolled weaving tension and loom speed. The experiments were conducted to determine warp and weft breaks at i) varying <b>warp</b> <b>tension</b> (50 cN to 85 cN) and constant speed (560 rpm,), ii) at constant warp tension(80 cN) and different loom speed (520 to 560 rpm). The company where {{the study was conducted}} is referred to as ?Company A?. Temperature and relative humidity and were kept constant at 27 ? and 75 % respectively. The yarn quality was good (11 cN/tex), according to the Ulster Statistics standard levels which was the exact tenacity of the 30 tex yarn used at ?Company A?. The results showed that warp and weft breaks occur even if the maximum <b>warp</b> <b>tension</b> during weaving is lower than the breaking strength of the yarn. A combination of high loom speed (560 rpm) and high tension (80 cN) lead to increased breaks, but breaks become reduced with the reduction in tension to 70 cNeven if the machine speed was maintained at 560 rpm. Above that tension, warp breaks start to increase. The number of warp breaks was also found to increase with the loom speed. Weft breaks also occurred due to entanglement at low <b>warp</b> <b>tension</b> (50 cN). Adjustment of <b>warp</b> <b>tension</b> and loom speed can help to determine the optimum values of <b>warp</b> <b>tension</b> and loom speed to be used {{in order to reduce the}} number of warp breaks for individual Air Jet Looms.

40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple <b>warp</b> <b>tensioning</b> systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile <b>warp</b> separately <b>tensioned</b> with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly <b>tensioned</b> <b>warp</b> beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R
