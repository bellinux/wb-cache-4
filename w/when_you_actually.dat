500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs {{are the kinds of things}} that are sort of funny in concept, less funny <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E
500|$|The Edge of Glory was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. While {{previewing}} the song Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote a positive review: [...] "This one sounds crazy in print , but somehow it all seems totally natural <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> hear it." [...] Perpetua added {{that there is an}} element of cheesiness in the song, but nevertheless, it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it. He complimented the inclusion of Clemons as an [...] "inspired touch that amplifies the song's Eighties stadium rock vibe," [...] and Clemons' actual performance was described as amazing and among the best of his career. In another review, Perpetua noted that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] is [...] "an immediate pop anthem". Fellow Rolling Stone journalist Jody Rosen complimented the hook, the chorus and Clemens' saxophone playing on the song. Jocelyn Vena from MTV News asserted that the song showed a softer side to Gaga, as opposed to her previous singles from Born This Way. Willa Paskin from New York was impressed with the track, saying: [...] "If the first two tracks off the forthcoming Born This Way were all jangly dance-rock, this is as smooth as an '80s jam straight off the Flashdance soundtrack, and it has the saxophone breakdown to prove it." [...] Paskin also believed that the song had potential to be a summer hit, but could face competition from singer Katy Perry's single, [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)".|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviews for {{the game}} were {{generally}} favorable upon release. Sega Official Magazine gave the game an 87% rating, praising the gameplay, graphics, and music, but complaining that the game lacked some originality and borrowed a lot from other platforming games at the time, such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Dynamite Headdy, and Earthworm Jim. Sega Pro praised it for both its similarities and differences from the Sonic the Hedgehog series, stating [...] "If you judged games purely by their visual looks, then you'd be forgiven for thinking that this WAS Sonic the Hedgehog. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> sit back and start playing it, you'll discover {{that this is a}} much slower, strategic game. There is a big puzzle element here, which should make it stand out from the hundreds of other platformers in the market". Sega Power made a number of similar points, comparing the gameplay to a mix [...] "between Sonic and Dynamite Headdy", but criticized its short length and lack of originality, and only gave it a 74 rating, [...] "...if you like Sonic games, you will like this" [...] but that [...] "...it's not as good as Sonic either." [...] GamePro likewise remarked that Ristar feels [...] "sluggish" [...] in comparison to Sonic, and criticized that Ristar has few animations compared to other platformer stars and that the game's low difficulty makes it suitable only for beginning gamers. However, they gave the game an overall recommendation based on the colorful visuals and cleverly designed gameplay. Electronic Gaming Monthlys team of five reviewers gave it a 7.6 out of 10, with Mike Weigand summarizing, [...] "An excellent new character, Ristar requires more technique than the typical run-and-jump action titles." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation, while noting that Ristar borrowed heavily from Dynamite Headdy, contended that the player character has more than enough originality and versatility to go beyond being a mere clone. Citing the excellent stage design, [...] "slick transparencies, original bosses, and great music", he deemed it [...] "one of the best platform games to date." [...] Despite this, he gave it only three out of five stars. Famitsu magazine scored the game a 29 out of 40.|$|E

The walks and rides about were really delightful; the scenery was grand and beautiful to the last degree; the Chinese-looking houses and Tartar dress were odd and picturesque, like a scene in a theatre.

After all, Olga said to herself with a smile more than once, it isn't half bad being married to a Tartar chieftain up in the border mountains, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> come to try it.

If you use the local number provided from your home or cell phone you pay for the cost of the first call, you can see this on your bills even if you don't get connected. The reason that 800 toll free is more expensive is because the Prepaid Calling Card Company pays for the attempts and even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> just call to check your balance, <b>you</b> only pay <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>actually</b> connected.

Everybody knows how much {{easier it is to}} get up the history and geography of a country <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>actually</b> in it than <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are merely reading about it.

Sight burns them into the brain without conscious effort. You can learn more of Egypt and of Egyptian history, culture, hieroglyphics, and language in a few short weeks at Luxor or Sakkarah than in a year at the Louvre and the British Museum. The Tombs of the Kings are worth many papyri. The mere sight of the temples and obelisks and monuments and inscriptions, in the places where their makers originally erected them, gives a sense of reality and interest to them all that no amount of study under alien conditions can possibly equal. We have all of us felt that the only place to observe Flemish art to the greatest advantage is at Ghent and Bruges and Brussels and Antwerp; just as the only place to learn Florentine art as it really was is at the Uffizi and the Bargello.|$|R

Suppose, for instance, that you are considering getting married, and {{that you know that}} if you get married, you will prefer being unmarried, and that if you stay unmarried, you will prefer being married. The general problem is to find a stable standard of well-being when the standard is set by preferences that are not stable. In this paper, I shall show that the problem is even worse: inconsistency threatens if we accept both that your desires determine what is good for you and that you must prefer what is better for you. After I have introduced a useful toy model and stated the inconsistency argument, I will go on to discuss a couple of unsuccessful theories and see what we can learn from their mistakes.
