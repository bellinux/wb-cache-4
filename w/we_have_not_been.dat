500|$|Balzac's use of repeat characters, {{moving in}} and out of the Comédies books, {{strengthens}} the realist representation. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> allowed to see". He also used a realist technique which French novelist Marcel Proust later termed [...] "retrospective illumination", whereby a character's past is revealed long after she or he first appears.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{experimented with}} this method {{throughout}} the thirty years {{he worked on}} La Comédie humaine. It enabled a depth of characterization that went beyond simple narration or dialogue. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from {{the privacy of their}} own lives which, for an interval, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> allowed to see." [...] Although the complexity of these characters' lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the mistakes are considered minor in the overall scope of the project. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac's world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin".|$|E
500|$|Harmon and Evashevski made {{immediate}} contributions, but Heikkinen {{was once}} again voted the team’s Most Valuable Player. Having been the first junior to win the award in 1937, {{he became the first}} player to receive the award twice in 1938. Though line coach Anderson did not return in 1937, Michigan hired Clarence “Biggie” Munn to replace him. Munn was a unanimous All-American guard for Minnesota in 1931. Under the new coaching staff of Crisler and Munn, Heikkinen became one of the best college football players in the country. After the 1938 season, Heikkinen credited Crisler and Munn for his development. Heikkinen noted that Michigan linemen were taught not to depend on sheer strength. [...] "We have not been taught to rear up and hurl back the opposition. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> taught to roll it back by power. We have been schooled to out-block and out-trick the other side. Our method is to be alert. We try to catch the other fellows off balance." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Soul Sound" [...] {{was directed by}} Max & Dania and filmed in London. Band member Siobhán Donaghy stated that {{around the time of}} the video's filming, her and the other group members were not performing as a group frequently: [...] "It's been fairly quiet recently, but it usually is between singles. The other two have been doing their exams, and I have been doing some interviews for newspapers and magazines abroad. Apart from the video for 'Soul Sound' <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> doing too much together." [...] During the video, the group's members are featured in an apartment and are seated on couches and chairs. The plot involves their inner souls being released by the music, while outside in the neighbourhood the music takes control of other people's lives and causes their souls to be lifted too. The video was included on the CD release of [...] "Soul Sound".|$|E
500|$|Balzac's use of {{recurring}} characters {{has been}} identified as a unique component of his fiction. It enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> allowed to see." [...] Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin". The characterization in La Cousine Bette is considered especially skillful. Anthony Pugh, in his book Balzac's Recurring Characters, says that the technique is employed [...] "for the most part without that feeling of self-indulgence that mars some of Balzac's later work. Almost every example arises quite naturally out of the situation." [...] Biographer Noel Gerson calls the characters in La Cousine Bette [...] "among the most memorable Balzac ever sketched".|$|E
500|$|In his {{confession}} Lace described {{how he had}} disposed of DeSimone's jewellery by throwing the items on to the railway embankment beneath Copnor Bridge in Portsmouth. In September 2009 a team of six British Transport Police officers with specialist training in forensic search techniques spent two days examining the area {{in an attempt to}} recover the jewellery. Although the ground had been the subject of extensive redevelopment in previous years and recovery of the items was considered unlikely, detectives authorised the operation to ensure every attempt had been made to find and return them to her parents. None of the items was discovered. DCI McTavish said of the search: [...] "It is recognised that in the years since Teresa's murder {{there has been a lot}} of disturbance and redevelopment around the railway track, but there was still a possibility that items may have lain undisturbed. Although <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to recover any items linked to either Teresa or the suspect it was important we did everything to explore this final aspect of the case." ...|$|E

500|$|Saban {{engineered}} {{a number}} of trades before the 1967 season. He brought Gilchrist to the team from Miami in a seven-player deal; Denver had sent Gilchrist to Miami the previous season. He also acquired quarterback Steve Tensi from the Chargers in August for first-round draft picks in 1968 and 1969. Denver won its first game, but proceeded to lose nine {{in a row and}} finish with a 3–11 record. The team improved only marginally in the ensuing years, posting losing records in 1968 and 1969. The AFL and National Football League merged beginning in 1970, but the Broncos continued to lose, posting a record of 5–8–1 in 1970. Saban resigned after the Broncos got off to a 2–6–1 start in 1971. He said resigning was [...] "my responsibility to the team" [...] and what while the club made progress, [...] "my only regret is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to give Denver a championship". Saban's record as Denver's coach was 20–42–3. Although he was not successful in Denver, Saban became well known for his intensity and occasional temper tantrums. A much-watched clip of him bemoaning to Denver line coach Whitey Dovell that [...] "They're killin' me out there, Whitey, they're killin' me!" [...] introduced Saban to a wider audience when it was aired by NFL Films.|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2012, a song {{entitled}} [...] "Enough Said" [...] {{was released}} online. The song {{was produced by}} Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib and features Canadian rapper Drake. Four days later, Jomo Hankerson confirmed a posthumous album is being produced {{and that it was}} scheduled to be released by the end of 2012 by Blackground Records. The album was reported to include 16 unreleased songs and have contributions from Aaliyah's longtime collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott, among others. On August 13, Timbaland and Missy Elliott dismissed rumors about being contacted or participating for the project. Elliott's manager Mona Scott-Young said in a statement to XXL, [...] "Although Missy and Timbaland always strive to keep the memory of their close friend alive, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> contacted about the project nor are there any plans at this time to participate. We've seen the reports surfacing that they have been confirmed to participate {{but that is not the}} case. Both Missy and Timbaland are very sensitive to the loss still being felt by the family so we wanted to clear up any misinformation being circulated." [...] Elliott herself said, [...] "Tim and I carry Aaliyah with us everyday, like so many of the people who love her. She will always live in our hearts. We have nothing but love and respect for her memory and for her loved ones left behind still grieving her loss. They are always in our prayers." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1802, Francis Jeffrey, {{editor of}} the Edinburgh Review, {{submitted}} a review on Thalaba. In the October 1802 edition, he claimed that Southey [...] "belongs to a sect of poets, that has established itself in this country within these ten or twelve years, and is looked upon, we believe, {{as one of its}} chief champions and apostles... As Mr Southey is the first author, of this persuasion, that has yet been brought before us for judgment, we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously, without premising a few words upon the nature and tendency of the tenets he has helped to promulgate. The disciples of this school boast much of its originality." [...] This led to a discussion of Southey's flaws: [...] "Originality, however, we are persuaded, is rare than mere alteration... That our new poets have abandoned the old models, may certainly be admitted; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to discover that they have yet created any model of their own." [...] He continued to discuss the flaws of the British Romantic poets before returning to Thalaba when he argued, [...] "The subject of this poem is almost as ill chosen as the diction; and the conduct of the fable as disorderly as the versification... From this little sketch of the story, our readers will easily perceive, that it consists altogether of the most wild and extravagant fictions, and openly sets nature and probability at defiance. In its action it is not an imitation of anything; and excludes all rational criticism, as to the choice and succession of its incidents." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> on {{the banks}} of the stream five minutes, before the Trackless came to a dead halt; like one who had met an {{unexpected}} obstacle. I was soon at his side, curious to know the motive of this delay.|$|R

2500|$|In 2008, the Seoul Metropolitan Government {{proposed}} a recommendation {{to the national}} government to add dogs {{to the list of}} livestock whose slaughter is regulated by law.
