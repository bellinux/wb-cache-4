She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in my plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working {{and being able to}} do what I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as I can keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago and we talked about it and <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> talking about it. We are all in the same head space, talking about how special it was and we do all want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy and <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} August 15 CIA analysts, despite their overall skeptical {{conclusions}} had noted, “Sightings of UFO's reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time}} when the background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even [...] "blue yonder" [...] explanations that might be tenable, and, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers.” On December 2, 1952 [...] CIA Assistant Director Chadwell noted, “Recent reports reaching CIA indicated that further action was desirable and another briefing by the cognizant A-2 and ATIC personnel was held on 25 November. At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention. The details of some of these incidents have been discussed by AD/SI with DDCI. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles”.|$|E

2500|$|The CIA {{started their}} own {{internal}} scientific review the following day. Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added, [...] "...as {{long as a}} series of reports remains 'unexplainable' (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject." [...] A report from later that month was similarly skeptical but nevertheless concluded [...] "...sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time when the}} background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even 'blue yonder' explanations that might be tenable, and <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers." [...] A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: [...] "...the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles." [...] Some of the memos also made it clear that CIA interest in the subject was not to be made public, partly in fear of possible public panic. (Good, 331–335) ...|$|E

[...] 10 [...] Till barbarous nations, and more barbarous times, [...] Debased the majesty of verse to rhymes: [...] Those rude at first; a kind of hobbling prose, [...] That limp'd along, and tinkled in the close. [...] But Italy, reviving from the trance [...] Of Vandal, Goth, and Monkish ignorance, [...] With pauses, cadence, and well-vowell'd words, [...] And all the graces a good ear affords, [...] Made rhyme an art, and Dante's polish'd page [...] Restored a silver, not a golden age.
