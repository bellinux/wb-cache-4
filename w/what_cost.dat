5|$|In {{the years}} after the fire One Meridian Plaza {{stood in the middle}} of Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the {{building}} was up in the air as the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at <b>what</b> <b>cost.</b> E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E
25|$|Because Medicare offers statutorily {{determined}} benefits, {{its coverage}} policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees {{are entitled to}} the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer disclosure requirements than Medicare, and studies show that customers {{in the private sector}} can find it difficult to know what their policy covers. and at <b>what</b> <b>cost.</b> Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees—data that private insurers treat as trade secrets—it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.|$|E

Activity based costing attempts to allocate costs based on those factors that drive the business to incur the costs.|$|R

2500|$|Terence Fretheim, Professor Emeritus at Luther Seminary, {{argued that}} [...] give a special {{twist to the}} issue of the firstborn, {{teaching}} that Israel was to be attentive to its firstborn because of the suffering of the Egyptian firstborn. Fretheim noted that [...] does not mention the redeemed Israelite children of Passover night but the sacrificed Egyptian firstborn, followed by “Therefore.” Fretheim thus argued that the firstborn belong to God not only because Israelite children were saved but also because Egyptian children were killed. Fretheim argued that [...] thus reminds Israel at <b>what</b> <b>cost</b> Israel's firstborn were redeemed. Fretheim nonetheless considered it doubtful that child sacrifice was in view.|$|E
2500|$|Tall (6ft 2½ in; 189cm), lanky and handsome, Scott {{displayed}} an easygoing {{charm and}} courtly Southern drawl {{in his early}} films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or [...] "lumbering". As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal [...] "strong, silent" [...] type of stoic hero. The BFI Companion to the Western noted:In his earlier Westerns... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes {{the man who has}} seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at <b>what</b> <b>cost?)</b> a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{focuses on}} the demise of a heroic society (the aristocratic Californios), but differs from other nineteenth century romances {{in that it is}} not written from the {{perspective}} of the conquerors, portraying a [...] "backwards" [...] people constrained by an outmoded order and unable to cope in the modern state. [...] On the contrary, The Squatter and the Don is written {{from the perspective of the}} conquered, questioning whether the new order indeed brought progress to California, and if so, at <b>what</b> <b>cost</b> considering the immorality of the invaders: the squatters, the monopolists, the corrupt political leaders, and their legislation. [...] Ultimately, the victims in the book are not only the Californios, but the squatters, the city of San Diego, and the entire California population, subject to the tyranny of the railroad monopoly in collusion with Congress and the state government.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Deming {{suggested}} [...] "There's {{just one}} problem with the gay agenda: it's based on a lie. Homosexuals are not like heterosexuals, nor is the practice of homosexuality innocuous. The single largest problem for the gay agenda is medical science. [...] The fact that about two-thirds of syphilis and AIDS cases occur amongst {{one percent of the}} population tells us something that is immediate and unambiguous: that homosexuality is not an innocuous choice. What gay men do behind closed doors is fundamentally different from what heterosexuals usually do in their bedrooms. [...] We are informed, endlessly, of the costs of gun violence, cigarette smoking, and obesity. What is the cost of homosexuality? How much does it cost to treat syphilis, AIDS, and a whole host of other diseases? <b>What</b> <b>cost</b> will we bear for the reemergence of syphilis, a disease that was almost eradicated? Neither are these plagues limited to gays. Bisexual men spread them into the heterosexual population." ...|$|E
2500|$|The State of California has {{proposed}} that all new low- and mid-rise residential buildings, and all new commercial buildings, be designed and constructed to ZNE standards beginning in 2020 and 2030, respectively. The requirements, if implemented, will be promulgated via the California Building Code, which is updated on a three-year cycle and which currently mandates {{some of the}} highest energy efficiency standards in the United States. California is anticipated to further increase efficiency requirements by 2020, thus avoiding the trends discussed above of building standard housing and achieving ZNE by adding large amounts of renewables. The California Energy Commission is required to perform a cost-benefit analysis to prove that new regulations create a net benefit for residents of the state. There has yet to be publicly released analysis of the impact that ZNE standards may have to construction, real estate, and energy prices in the state. Debate exists as to if the state's stringent efficiency requirements are directly responsible for the apparent [...] "flatlining" [...] of residential electricity use in the state since 1975. This debate is relevant to ZNE codes, as {{it remains to be seen}} via models or in practice what overall effect the proliferation of ZNE buildings will have on overall electricity use in the state, and at <b>what</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
