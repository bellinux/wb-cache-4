5|$|In the Western <b>world,</b> <b>about</b> 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past.

Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E
5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO {{religion}} that {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël.

They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era.
