5|$|In February 1936 Pontecorvo left Italy {{and moved}} to Paris to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> of Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the Collège de France on a one-year {{scholarship}} to {{study the effects of}} collisions of neutrons with protons and on the electromagnetic transitions among isomers. During this period, influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he adopted the ideals of communism to which he remained loyal {{for the rest of his}} life. He formed a relationship with Helene Marianne Nordblom, a Swedish woman working in Paris as a nanny. Whether because of his relationship with Marianne, his interesting work on isomers, or the deteriorating political situation in Italy, he turned down an opportunity in 1937 to apply for a tenured position at the University of Rome to stay in Paris.|$|E

25|$|On May 10, 1876, Colonel Lilly founded his own {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturing business, which {{became known as}} Eli Lilly and Company, at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis. Josiah, who was aged fourteen {{at the time was}} among its first employees. He had quit school to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> of his father's company as an apprentice and errand boy. Within a few years Eli Lilly and Company became a very successful business that was known for manufacturing high-quality prescription drugs, especially gelatin- and sugar-coated pills and capsules and fruit-flavored elixirs. By 1879 company sales had grown to $48,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars).|$|E

2500|$|He died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a {{heart attack}} soon after {{returning}} to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery. Mario Bunge, a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that [...] "scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife" [...] and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory.</b> In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.|$|E

60|$|Linton was at <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory.</b> He was an enthusiastic, but unskilful, chemist. The {{only thing}} he could do with any real {{certainty}} was to make oxygen. But he had ambitions beyond that feat, and was continually experimenting in a reckless way which made the chemistry master look wan and uneasy. He was bending over a complicated mixture of tubes, acids, and Bunsen burners when Dunstable found him. It was after school, so that the laboratory was empty, but for them.|$|E

60|$|As Redwood's Bull calves {{needed his}} daily attention, the {{selection}} and equipment of the Experimental Farm fell largely on Bensington. The entire cost also, was, it was understood, to be defrayed by Bensington, at least until a grant could be obtained. Accordingly he alternated his <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> of his flat with farm hunting {{up and down the}} lines that run southward out of London, and his peering spectacles, his simple baldness, and his lacerated cloth shoes filled the owners of numerous undesirable properties with vain hopes. And he advertised in several daily papers and Nature for a responsible couple (married), punctual, active, and used to poultry, to take entire charge of an Experimental Farm of three acres.|$|E
60|$|But supposing the Professorial {{forces of}} our University to be duly organised, there remains an {{important}} question, {{relating to the}} teaching power, to be considered. Is the Professorial system--the system, I mean, of teaching in the lecture-room alone, and leaving the student to find his own way when he is outside the lecture-room--adequate to the wants of learners? In answering this question, I confine myself to my own province, and I venture to reply for Physical Science, assuredly and undoubtedly, No. As I have already intimated, practical <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Laboratory</b> is absolutely indispensable, and that practical work must be guided and superintended by a sufficient staff of Demonstrators, who are for Science what Tutors are for other branches of study. And {{there must be a}} good supply of such Demonstrators. I doubt if the practical work of more than twenty students can be properly superintended by one Demonstrator. If we take the working day at six hours, that is less than twenty minutes apiece--not a very large allowance of time for helping a dull man, for correcting an inaccurate one, or even for making an intelligent student clearly apprehend what he is about. And, no doubt, the supplying of a proper amount of this tutorial, practical teaching, is a difficulty in the way of giving proper instruction in Physical Science in such Universities as that of Aberdeen, which are devoid of endowments; and, unlike the English Universities, have no moral claim on the funds of richly endowed bodies to supply their wants.|$|E
60|$|I am {{not saying}} this without full {{practical}} justification for the statement. For the last eighteen years we have had in England a system of elementary science teaching carried out {{under the auspices of}} the Science and Art Department, by which elementary scientific instruction is made readily accessible to the scholars of all the elementary schools in the country. Commencing with small beginnings, carefully developed and improved, that system now brings up for examination as many as seven thousand scholars in the subject of human physiology alone. I can say that, out of that number, a large proportion have acquired a fair amount of substantial knowledge; and that no inconsiderable percentage show as good an acquaintance with human physiology as used to be exhibited by the average candidates for medical degrees in the University of London, when I was first an examiner there twenty years ago; and quite as much knowledge as is possessed by the ordinary student of medicine at the present day. I am justified, therefore, in looking forward to the time when the student who proposes to devote himself to medicine will come, not absolutely raw and inexperienced as he is at present, but in a certain state of preparation for further study; and I look to the university to help him still further forward in that stage of preparation, through the organisation of its biological department. Here the student will find means of acquainting himself with the phenomena of life in their broadest acceptation. He will study not botany and zoology, which, as I have said, would take him too far away from his ultimate goal; but, by duly arranged instruction, combined with <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> upon the leading types of animal and vegetable life, he will lay a broad, and at the same time solid, foundation of biological knowledge; he will come to his medical studies with a comprehension of the great truths of morphology and of physiology, with his hands trained to dissect and his eyes taught to see. I have no hesitation in saying that such preparation is worth a full year added on to the medical curriculum. In other words, it will set free that much time for attention to those studies which bear directly upon the student's most grave and serious duties as a medical practitioner.|$|E
