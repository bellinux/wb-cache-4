5000|$|Accordingly, Charles V {{considered}} {{it necessary to}} renew and confirm the Jews' charter. At the same time these rights and privileges were extended to the Jews of the whole empire.

Whoever violated the imperial constitutio pacis by infringing upon the rights of the Jews was to be punished by every authority. Every Jew was {{to have the right to}} do business in the empire and every authority was to protect him and not burden him with tolls or duties. Jews were not required to wear [...] "Jewish insignias" [...] outside of their dwellings and no Jew was to be driven from his home without the emperor's expressed consent. Because Jews paid higher taxes but had no public offices, real estate or manual trade, they were allowed to charge higher interest rates than the Christians. It was forbidden to accuse Jews of using Christian blood without due proof and <b>witness,</b> to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> prisoner, to torture or to execute them. Infringements of this privilege were to be fined with 50 marks in gold, one half to be paid to the emperor and the other to the Jewish community.In 1548 this charter was once more confirmed by Charles V and again by emperor Maximilian II in 1566.|$|R
