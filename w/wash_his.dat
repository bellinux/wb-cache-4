5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Pfaster, who {{was behind}} the exhumations, proves Mulder's {{prediction}} correct when he brings a prostitute to his apartment. When the prostitute discovers a collection of funerary wreaths in Pfaster's bedroom, he kills her and removes her fingers. Later, Pfaster—having been hired as a frozen food delivery man through charming the female interviewer—delivers to a low-security house {{of a woman with}} teenage daughters. He requests the bathroom to <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands, and whilst there steals some discarded hair from a brush he found in the trashcan. Pfaster attends a night class at a community college, where a female classmate defends herself after he makes threatening advances. He is arrested and is placed in a jail cell across from a suspect being interrogated for Pfaster's crimes by Mulder, Scully, and Bocks. Pfaster shows interest in Scully, and learns her name from the interrogated suspect. Pfaster is later released as his charges were dropped.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car <b>wash.</b> <b>His</b> sister's boyfriend encouraged him {{to apply for a}} job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.|$|E

5000|$|Panel 5. This panel depicts Pilate <b>washing</b> <b>his</b> hands. The Gospel of Matthew {{states that}} before condemning Jesus to death, Pilate <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> hands with water {{in front of}} the crowd, saying, [...] "I am {{innocent}} of this man's blood; you will see." ...|$|R
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests {{it was the right thing}} to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened {{at the spot where}} the water used to <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.|$|E

25|$|When saying Kiddush, {{the blessing}} over the wine (or over the bread) precedes the blessing over the day. One {{does not need}} to <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands before saying Kiddush but he should wash them after. The towel used to wash one's hands should not be placed on the table, lest it and {{anything}} that comes into contact with it be rendered ritually unclean.

25|$|After Jesus' {{return from}} Herod's court, Pilate {{publicly}} declares that he finds Jesus {{to be innocent}} of the charges, but the crowd insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governor and Pilate decided to publicly <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands as not being privy to Jesus' death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate pleading Jesus' case {{rather than as a}} judge in an official hearing, yet he orders the crucifixion of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|They led the High Priest down to {{the place}} of {{immersion}} (the mikveh). During the day of Yom Kippur, the High Priest would immerse himself five times and <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands and feet ten times. Except for this first immersion, he would do each on holy ground in the Parwah cell. They spread a linen sheet between him and the people. If the High Priest was either old or delicate, they warmed the water for him. He undressed, immersed himself, came up, and dried off. They brought him the golden garments; he put them on and washed his hands and feet.|$|E

The actor's face is painted red with a few black lines, to represent honour and courage. He also wears a long three-section black beard made of yak hair and carries the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Traditionally, after the show ends, the actor has to <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> face, burn joss paper, light incense, and pray to Chinese deities.|$|E
25|$|Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, {{claimed in}} his memoirs to have {{discovered}} bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly {{running out of the}} basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands in a semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect. There is no mention of the sink in the official police reports.|$|E
25|$|Tattooing is {{regulated}} {{in many countries}} because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands and face. When {{he approached the}} station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E
500|$|Nick Kamen {{attained}} {{popularity in}} 1985 when his modelling career {{gave him the}} chance to star in Levi's television commercial.

The advertisement had immediate impact, with Levi's sales increasing by 800% and making it the number one jeans manufacturer. It also made Kamen a household name and a sex symbol. Singer Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] was featured in the commercial and its sales were also boosted, resulting in the song reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|Australia {{were due}} to tour England to contest the Ashes in 1909. [...] Hill, along with other senior players, was {{fighting}} against a proposal to move the management of international tours away from the players to the new Australian Board of Control for International Cricket Matches. Hill by now was a team selector and strongly opposed the selection in the team of 40-year-old Peter McAlister, who Hill claimed [...] "was past his best" [...] and [...] "not suited to English conditions". McAlister was {{also a member of}} the selection panel and was able to secure a majority for his selection. Hill accused his fellow selectors of conspiracy and said he had [...] "decided to <b>wash</b> <b>his</b> hands of the affair" [...] and that [...] "he did not consider that the best men had been chosen". Hill's relationship with McAlister would remain fractious. [...] Hill was also a delegate on the Board of Control, representing the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). [...] At the Board meeting in February 1909 to set the terms to be offered to the players selected for the tour, the SACA delegates were outvoted on every point. Hill declined to accept the terms offered. Since his marriage in 1905, Hill had spent considerable time away from his wife with his commitments during two Test series against England and this may have also influenced his decision not to tour.|$|E
