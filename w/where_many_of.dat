5|$|After {{sending his}} wife to Kentucky, where their first child was born, Hines began living in Memphis, Tennessee, passing the bar exam on June 12, 1866, with high honors. During his stay in Memphis he also edited the Daily Appeal. Hines moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 1867, <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his family lived, and practiced law there. Basil W. Duke {{appointed}} Hines a colonel in the Soldiers of the Red Cross. Hines later became the County Judge for Warren County, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|An outspoken {{advocate}} of prohibition, he made substantial {{donations to the}} Prohibition Party and Indiana's prohibitionist leader Frank Hanly. Haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in Indiana for the U.S. Senate in 1916 as a prohibition candidate and remained active in the party until prohibition became law. Later, he became a philanthropist and served two terms {{as president of the}} YMCA, five years on the Indiana Board of Education, and was {{an active member of the}} Presbyterian church. After his death from complications arising from influenza, his Kokomo mansion was converted into the Elwood Haynes Museum and is open to the public <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his original inventions and automobiles are on display.|$|E

5|$|On 30 December 1947, {{members of}} the Irgun, a Jewish {{underground}} militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside {{the gates of the}} Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in {{what became known as the}} Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre. Control of Haifa was critical in the ensuing civil war, since it was the major industrial and oil refinery port in British Palestine.|$|E
5|$|One of Favre's {{properties}} on the Pearl River {{was originally}} settled {{by his father}} in 1767, and was inherited by Favre upon his father's death in 1782. This plantation later {{became known as the}} town of Napoleon, and Favre kept a store there that later became a part of the community's church. In 1961 all the residents of the town were moved when the property was declared within the buffer zone of the John C. Stennis Space Center.

5|$|St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} village of Dulas, in Anglesey, north Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also {{dedicated}} to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become too small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into the family that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment {{was soon}} posted back to Cape Town, <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction {{at the lack}} of {{fighting}} in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that they would see action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded {{due to a lack of}} personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.|$|E
5|$|The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which could have put the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} produced shaking at Pangandaran (where the M6.3 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake {{was felt}} more strongly) of intensity III–IV (Weak–Light), intensity III at Cianjur, and II (Weak) at Yogyakarta. Further inland and {{farther from the}} epicenter, intensity IV shaking made tall buildings sway in Jakarta, but at some coastal villages <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the casualties occurred, the shaking was not felt as strong. An informal survey of 67 people that were present at the time revealed that in at least eight cases, individuals stated {{that they did not}} feel the earthquake at all (a typical M7.7 earthquake would have been distinctly noticed at those distances). The unusually low felt intensities, along with the short period body wave magnitudes, were components of the event that narrowed its classification into that of a tsunami earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions, often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor water drainage, making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms {{can lead to}} tornados, damaging hail, storm surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by negatively impacting agriculture, {{one of the main}} economic activities of the country, and by increasing energy demand, which can lead to energy shortages.|$|E
5|$|The {{wealth of}} Fatimid {{architecture}} {{was found in}} the main cities of Mahdia (921–948), Al-Mansuriya (948–973) and Cairo (973–1169). The heartland of architectural activity and expression during Fatimid rule was at al-Qahira, the old city of Cairo, on {{the eastern side of the}} Nile, <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the palaces, mosques and other buildings were built. Al-Aziz Billah (ruled 975–996) is generally considered to have been the most extensive of Fatimid builders, credited with at least thirteen major landmarks including the Golden Palace, the Cairo Mosque, a fortress, a belvedere, a bridge and public baths.|$|E

5|$|When the Roman fleet reached Africa, {{a council}} was held aboard Belisarius' {{flagship}} (The Vandalic War, I.15), <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his officers advocated an immediate attack on Carthage itself, especially {{since it was}} the only fortified city in the Vandal realm, the walls of the other cities having been torn down to prevent a rebellion. Belisarius, however, mindful of the fate of the 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with the Vandal fleet, spoke against it. Thus the army disembarked and built a fortified camp to spend the night.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Brigham Young, Chamberlin was {{employed}} as a lecturer and George Leib Harrison Foundation {{research fellow at the}} University of Pennsylvania from 1911 to 1913. From March 1913 to December 31, 1925, he was the Curator of Arachnids, Myriapods, and Worms at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his scientific contributions were made. Here his publications included surveys of all known millipedes of Central America and the West Indies; and descriptions of animals collected by the Canadian Arctic Expedition (1913–1916); by Stanford and Yale expeditions to South America; and by various expeditions of the USS Albatross. He was elected a member of the American Society of Naturalists and the American Society of Zoologists in 1914, and in 1919 served as second vice-president of the Entomological Society of America. He served as a technical expert for the U.S. Horticultural Board and U.S. Biological Survey from 1923 until the mid 1930s.|$|E
5|$|For his services, Ferdinand awarded Monte Sant'Angelo to Skanderbeg <b>where</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his men soon settled. They settled fifteen {{villages in}} the rolling landscapes {{to the east of}} Taranto. His return to Albania was greeted as a triumph by his followers. Despite the jubilation, however, Skanderbeg began to prepare for war. On 7 July 1462, the Turkish army resumed its campaigns in Albania. The first major {{engagement}} was at Mokra on 7 July 1462. In the following Macedonian campaign in August of the same year, Skanderbeg defeated three Ottoman armies in one month. On 27 April 1463, Skanderbeg and Mehmed signed a new peace treaty, but later, on 9 September 1463, Skanderbeg signed an alliance with Venice which had been preparing for war against the Ottomans. On 12 October 1463, Pius grew confident enough to declare his crusade against the Ottoman Turks which Skanderbeg joined.|$|E
