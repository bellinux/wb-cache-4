Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence.

That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years?

When Justice William O. Douglas traveled to India in 1950, the first question he was asked was, [...] "Why does America tolerate the lynching of Negroes?" [...] Douglas later wrote that he had learned from his travels that [...] "the attitude of the United States toward its colored minorities is a powerful factor in our relations with India." [...] Chief Justice Earl Warren, nominated to the Supreme Court by President Eisenhower, echoed Douglas's concerns in a 1954 speech to the American Bar Association, proclaiming that [...] "Our American system like all others is on trial both at home and abroad, ... the extent to which <b>we</b> <b>maintain</b> the spirit of our constitution with its Bill of Rights, will in the long run do more to make it both secure and the object of adulation than the number of hydrogen bombs we stockpile." ...|$|E

This is the proof: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them' (Matt. 18:20). How much more is he present where the whole congregation is assembled to his honor! But that his body is literally eaten is far from the truth and the nature of faith. It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught).

2500|$|Within {{the last}} three decades, a number of theologians have put forward other [...] "new perspectives" [...] on Paul's {{doctrine}} of justification, and even more specifically on what he says about justification by faith. According to Simon Gathercole, [...] "Justification by faith" [...] means God accepts Gentiles in addition to Jews, since both believe in God. Paul writes {{in his letter to}} the Romans, [...] "For <b>we</b> <b>maintain</b> that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. Is God the God of Jews only? [...] Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith". Faith is the central component of Paul's doctrine of justification — meaning that Gentiles don't need to become Israelites when they convert to Christianity, because God is not just the God of one nation, but Gentile and Jew alike.|$|E
