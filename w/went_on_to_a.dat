5|$|Early in Tyler's {{final year}} at Washington, {{injuries}} to the Huskies' halfbacks prompted head coach Don James {{to move him}} there from fullback.

Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to his campaign to $300 and refusing to run television commercials.

5|$|On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came {{face-to-face}} against 80 gunmen {{which became}} known as the Frisco shootout.

Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and {{over the course of a}} 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed.

Although Payton's offensive prowess had assisted the Bears throughout the 1985 season, he did not score any touchdowns in the postseason and the New England Patriots prevented him from reaching the end zone in the Super Bowl. According to quarterback Jim McMahon, he was targeted by two or three defenders on every play, and others stated that Payton's mere presence allowed others to shine, given that at least 2 people were targeting Payton on every play. In a later interview, Ditka stated {{that one of his}} major regrets was Payton's lack of a touchdown in the Super Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in {{a stand of}} 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, {{so he had to}} make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{a mixture}} of medium pace and his new style of off spin, Macaulay played 27 matches in 1921.

Four more wickets in the second innings gave Yorkshire a big victory and Macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs, the first time he had taken ten wickets in a match. Macaulay then came to wider public attention by taking six wickets for three runs to bowl out Derbyshire for 23 runs. He later took ten wickets in the match against Surrey in a losing cause, and in total that season he took 101 first-class wickets at an average of 17.33, placing him third in the Yorkshire bowling averages. With the bat, he scored 457 runs at an average of 22.59, surprising commentators with his ability. This included a maiden first-class century against Nottinghamshire. His innings of 125 not out took Yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets when he came in to bat (228 for eight soon after) to a total of 438 for nine declared, a lead of 264; Yorkshire <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> comfortable win. His overall success in the season meant that his place in the team was secure.|$|E
