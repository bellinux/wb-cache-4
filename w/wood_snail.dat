[...] The high-altitude Alpine salamanders have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs. Brown trout {{can be found in the}} streams up to the snow line. Molluscs such as the <b>wood</b> <b>snail</b> live up the snow line. Popularly gathered as food, the snails are now protected.|$|E

Although I bid you rob her treasury, I find you sitting drowsed and motionless, And yet you {{understand}} that while it's full She'll bid against us and so bribe the poor That our great Master'll lack his merchandise. You know that she has brought into this house The old and ailing that are pinched the most At such a time and so should be bought cheap. You've seen us sitting in {{the house in the}} <b>wood,</b> While the <b>snails</b> crawled about the window-pane And the mud floor, and not a soul to buy; Not even the wandering fool's nor one of those That when the world goes wrong must rave and talk, Until they are as thin as a cat's ear. But all that's nothing; you sit drowsing there With your back hooked, your chin upon your knees.|$|R
40|$|The endemic Hawaiian moth genus Hyposmocoma {{includes}} {{hundreds of}} species, providing dramatic examples of explosive radiation and ecological specialization. Many {{of these species}} exhibit typical caterpillar feeding ecology, consuming plant material, including aquatic algae-grazing and fern stem-boring. However, one clade deviates from this norm and has developed carnivorous behavior, an extremely rare trait in Lepidoptera worldwide. These species demonstrate behavior ranging from simple scavenging to molluscivorous prey capture, and their behavioral ecology and morphology reflects this. Here I investigate the degree of specialization and variation in behavior and morphology of several species of carnivorous Hyposmocoma, including both described and undescribed species. Observations and analyses are focused on prey preference of the carnivorous, "cigar" case clade, and mandible morphology within this and other Hyposmocoma groups. My results demonstrate that prey preference varies among species within the carnivorous clade, and ranges from arthropod scavenging to specialized snail capture behavior. The genus Hyposmocoma exhibits extraordinary diversity in terms of: number of species, caterpillar case morphology, feeding behavior (from algae eaters in streams to obligate snail eaters in native forests) and preferred habitat (from dry lowland forests to upper elevation cloud forest, to streams). This study set out to investigate whether similar levels of polymorphism exist in mandible microstructure. My hypothesis was that with so many vastly different natural history traits, a feature with critical adaptive function such as mandible morphology will reflect this dramatic level of variation. However, an unexpectedly low level of variation was observed. Mandible microstructure {{was found to be}} highly conserved, whether preferred feeding type included <b>wood</b> boring or <b>snail</b> feeding. Possible reasons for mandible structure conservation include recent speciation events, and the possibility that the structure observed across the genus is versatile enough such that it is functionally effective in diverse settings. Continued analyses of Hyposmocoma ecology, behavior, and morphology will prove useful in phylogenetic inference, and warrants continued study alongside ongoing molecular research...|$|R
60|$|On {{emerging}} from the forest I found the adjacent plain covered with cattle quietly grazing. Any attempt {{to pass through the}} herd would have been almost certain death, as these more than half-wild beasts will always take revenge on their master man when they catch him dismounted in the open. As they were coming up {{from the direction of the}} river, and were slowly grazing past the wood, I resolved to wait for them to pass on before leaving my concealment. I sat down and tried to be patient, but the brutes were in no hurry, and went on skirting the <b>wood</b> at a <b>snail's</b> pace. It was about six o'clock before the last stragglers had left, and then I ventured out from my hiding-place, hungry as a wolf and afraid of being overtaken by night before finding any human habitation. I had left the trees half a mile behind me, and was walking hurriedly along towards the valley of the YÃ­, when, passing over a hillock, I suddenly found myself in sight of a bull resting on the grass and quietly chewing his cud. Unfortunately the brute saw me at the same moment and immediately stood up. He was, I think, about three or four years old, and a bull of that age is even more dangerous than an older one; for he is quite as truculent as the other and far more active. There was no refuge of any kind near, and I knew very well that to attempt to escape by running would only increase my danger, so after gazing at him for a few moments I assumed an easy, unconcerned manner and walked on; but he was not going to be taken in that way, and began to follow me. Then for the first, and I devoutly hope for the last, time in my life I was compelled to resort to the gaucho plan, and, casting myself face downwards on the earth, lay there simulating death. It is a miserable, dangerous expedient, but, in the circumstances I found myself, the only one offering a chance of escape from a very terrible death. In a few moments I heard his heavy tramp, then felt him sniffing me all over. After that he tried unsuccessfully to roll me over, in order to study my face, I suppose. It was horrible to endure the prods he gave me and lie still, but after a while he grew quieter, and contented himself by simply keeping guard over me; occasionally smelling at my head, then turning round to smell at my heels. Probably his theory was, if he had one, that I had fainted with fear at the sight of him and would recover presently, but he was not quite sure at which end of me returning life would first show itself. About once in every five or six minutes he seemed to get impatient, and then he would paw me with his heavy hoof, uttering a low, hoarse moaning, spattering me with froth from his mouth; but as he showed no disposition to leave, I at last resolved to try a very bold experiment, for my position was becoming unendurable. I waited till the brute's head was turned from me, then worked my hand cautiously down to my revolver; but before I had quite drawn it, he noticed the movement and wheeled swiftly round, kicking my legs as he did so. Just as he brought his head round close to mine, I discharged the weapon in his face, and the sudden explosion so terrified him that he turned tail and fled, never pausing in his lumbering gallop till he was out of sight. It was a glorious victory; and though I could scarcely stand on my legs at first, so stiff and bruised did I feel all over, I laughed with joy, and even sent another bullet whizzing after the retreating monster, accompanying the discharge with a wild yell of triumph.|$|R
