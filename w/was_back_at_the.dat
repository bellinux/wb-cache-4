5|$|On March 28, 2007, Bosh {{became the}} new {{franchise}} record holder for double doubles {{in a home}} win against the Miami Heat. He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week {{for the third time}} in his career shortly after, having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records. As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who left had Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ACC as a Net. Toronto's inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91. The Raptors won Game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced Game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in Game 5. The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in Game 6. Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 ppg and 10.7 rpg for the regular season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 ppg and 9.0 rpg for the playoffs. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.|$|E

The same day he was also appointed Ranger of Greenwich Park.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2007 Apertura season, Paraguayan legend José Cardozo took the helm as coach. His tenure did not last long, as Olimpia were unable to win the championship. For the Clausura tournament, former star player Alicio Solalinde <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> helm. Though his record was not bad, he was replaced by Carlos Jara Saguier halfway through the tournament. This sparked a lot of controversy, as Saguier was a former player of Cerro Porteño, and an admitted fan of that club. Olimpia finished third in the Clausura tournament, behind Libertad and Cerro Porteño. A fourth-place finish in the global tabulation (adding both Apertura and Clausura tournaments) has allowed Olimpia to return to international play in the Copa Sudamericana of 2008 after 4 years of absence.|$|E

500|$|To {{the extreme}} north, XIV Corps {{conducted}} diversionary activities employing one brigade each from the 57th and 50th divisions. The 57th Division attack advanced into a marsh, which stopped the attack {{close to the}} start line. The division established advanced posts at Rubens and Memlings Farms [...] forward. On the 50th Division front, the right battalion got to within [...] of the objective, before fire from German machine-guns and snipers forced a withdrawal to the start line. Further north up to the Ypres–Staden railway line, a battalion reached Hill 23, Aden House and Tourenne Crossing but <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start line by [...] The left battalion advanced [...] before machine-gun fire forced {{it back to the}} start line. All of the Fifth Army attacks encountered deep mud, which slowed progress to a crawl, caused the barrage to be lost and clogged weapons, in the face of German counterattacks, which forced most attacks back to their start lines.|$|E
500|$|... "Mom and Pop Art" [...] {{was written}} by current showrunner Al Jean and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April11,1999. It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to The Simpsons writing staff. For three years, Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom Teen Angel, a job which he despised. [...] "Every other day [...] I said 'I wish I <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons," [...] Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. The idea for the episode came from {{a segment of the}} television news magazine 60 Minutes. The segment was about found artists, who, Jean said, [...] "take basically garbage and assemble it and turn it into artwork that would sell {{for tens of thousands of}} dollars." [...] Jean thought that this profession would fit Homer. In the episode, [...] "Start here tomorrow 7/17/95" [...] is written in blue paint on the Simpsons' garage door. The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker's anniversary, which was on July17,1995. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a hardware store. The segment was inspired by Jean's father, who owned a hardware store that Al Jean used to work in as a child. Later in the setpiece, Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from the hardware store. The scene was also conceived by Jean, and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully's favorite setpiece.|$|E

500|$|Some 16,000 spectators {{turned out}} to watch. From the start, both sides had good attacking opportunities. Early on, through the kicking of Verge and Blarney (playing threequarter), NSW got to within 25 yards of the Queensland try line but the {{visitors}} {{managed to get the}} ball away. Shortly after, Queensland kicked the ball hard towards Verge, who <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NSW goal line, and the Queensland threequarter—and captain—Lonnie Spragg, chased fast after it but Verge kicked the ball away safely. NSW scored the first points with a goal from a mark by Stan Wickham and Queensland responded with a penalty goal before half time. The score at the break was 4–3 to NSW. Verge's defensive work in the first half was noted by The Sunday Times of Sydney. Straight after the break, Wickham kicked a drop goal for NSW but Queensland scored a try moments later, which was converted and gave Queensland the lead 7–8. Another penalty and a try for NSW put the home side ahead 13–8 for the victory. The game was considered one of the best between the two states. Verge, according to The Sunday Times, [...] "made a highly creditable debut in representative football, in a match that required the full back to have his wits about him." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald noted that [...] "Verge on several occasions saved splendidly, generally finding the line with useful punts and never losing his head." [...] Playing for University against South Sydney soon after, Verge gave a [...] "brilliant exposition... sure in catching, very quick and tricky on his feet, and excellent in finding the line, he could not have done better work." ...|$|E

The following year she <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Union Theatre in Mel Dinelli's The Man (14 November 1955 – 26 November 1955).

2500|$|In 979 Otto II {{supposedly}} attacked Poland. Mention of {{this event}} {{can be found in}} the Chronicle of the Bishops of Cambrai from the 11th century. The effects of this expedition are unknown, but it is suspected that the Emperor did not succeed. Due to bad weather, the Emperor <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> border of Thuringia and Saxony in December of that year. It is uncertain whether the invasion actually took place. The chronicle only stated that it was an expedition [...] "against the Slavs". Archaeological discoveries appear to support the thesis of Otto II's invasion. In the last quarter of the 10th century there had been a radical expansion of the fortifications at Gniezno and Ostrów Lednicki, which may be associated with the Polish-German war, or the expectation of such. The duration of the expedition suggests that it may have reached as far east as the vicinity of Poznań.|$|E
