25|$|Steele’s {{skill with}} Prairie Style designs and {{his success in}} {{interesting}} clients had markedly increased {{as a result of}} his three-year collaboration with famous Minneapolis-based architect George Grant Elmslie. With Elmslie as principal designer and with some assistance from Elmslie's partner William Gray Purcell, Steele had erected the Prairie Style <b>Woodbury</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse (Sioux City, 1915-1918). About 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest in Lake Andes, South Dakota, Steele had designed the Charles Mix County Courthouse (1916-1917), also in the Prairie Style. Steele’s success is particularly noteworthy since the Prairie School was in decline by this time, losing ground rapidly to a resurgence of more conservative styles after about 1914, and particularly after World War I.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaders of}} Hartington {{would have been}} {{familiar}} with these and other Steele-designed Prairie School style buildings; {{there would be no}} surprise in what they were getting. What is surprising is that they agreed to the progressive design. There was considerable public outcry against the <b>Woodbury</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse just five years earlier (including demands from one group for “a courthouse of ordinary and usual design”), but no record of dissent in Hartington. This design “as compared to other known civic buildings in the surrounding counties, stands as a progressive building in an otherwise conservative community.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232, {{en route}} from Denver-Stapleton to Philadelphia via Chicago-O'Hare, crashed at Sioux Gateway Airport while {{attempting}} an emergency landing. 111 passengers and 1 crew member were killed, while 174 passengers and 10 crew members survived.

2500|$|In their evaluation, James D. Fagler and Joni Gilkerson not {{surprisingly}} note the many features in common between the Hartington City Hall and the <b>Woodbury</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse, on which Steele had earlier collaborated with George Grant Elmslie. However, they {{also point to}} a series of similarities between the Hartington municipal building and Frank Lloyd Wright’s earlier Larkin Administration Building (Buffalo, New York, 1904–1906), an innovative Prairie School office building designed for the Larkin Company, then a major national mail-order firm. Both buildings are primarily inward focused but bring light in, feature steel-frame construction covered with plain red brick surfaces, are trimmed with simple stone copings above, use sculptured piers as the primary ornamentation, and possess facades where the pilasters separating the windows are more pronounced than the windows in between. In both structures, prominent vertical lines are “abruptly terminated at the roof line by the stone course {{at the top of the}} heavy pylon-like projections at the corners, along the wings and central bays.” ...|$|E
