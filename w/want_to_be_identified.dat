2500|$|Polish {{ambassador}} to Germany, Marek Prawda, Poland's Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed unease with Steinbach's {{appointment to the}} board of the Center against Expulsions in February 2009. Władysław Bartoszewski, an Auschwitz survivor who is Poland’s commissioner on relations with Germany, said that giving Mrs Steinbach a seat on the board would be akin to the Vatican appointing a Holocaust denier like Richard Williamson to manage relations with Israel. On 16 September 2010, Steinbach attested Bartoszewski [...] "a bad character" [...] on German TV. At the time the Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, privately warned Berlin that allowing Mrs Steinbach’s appointment would shake German-Polish relations “to their foundations”. [...] "Do people whose families lived there for generations <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> with a person like Mrs. Steinbach, who came to our country with Hitler and had to leave it with Hitler too?" [...] Sikorski said in Brussels on February 23, 2009, referring to Steinbach’s father having moved to German occupied Poland during the war and asked her to follow the example of President Horst Köhler, who was born within a family of wartime German settlers in Poland and never considered himself an expellee. The fact that Steinbach represents a person born to a German officer stationed in occupied Poland has been described as one of the essential issues for Poles.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{exploratory}} study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> determine whether we could establish a connection between identity and clothing among the respondents. The respondents clearly used clothing to signal their identity and how they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b> For our first question, “Does your clothing represent your identity?” 10 respondents (67  %) answered “yes,” three respondents (20  %) answered “somewhat,” one respondent (7  %) answered “no,” and one respondent (7  %) was unsure or did not care. Therefore, the majority of subjects (87  %) gave a positive response to the question. These responses indicate that young men tend to express their identities through their clothing choices, {{consistent with the findings}} of Hathcote and Kim (2008), who found that men’s identities were communicated by the way they dressed.|$|R

He is dragged by Jimmy into the car, and comes round just as the police begin shooting and returns fire. The getaway driver is killed by the police but the robbery is on the whole successful. Jimmy gets the money he needs, escaping in a stolen Toyota Celica with his remaining accomplice. Ironically, the stolen auto's radio station bumper sticker is spotted by that station's competition team, who give chase attempting to award Jimmy a $10,000 prize. Not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> after the robbery, Jimmy rams them off the road.|$|R

5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was {{therefore}} credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|R
5000|$|The term kutcha butcha {{was coined}} {{because of the}} stigma that began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{attached}} <b>to</b> members of this biracial community, and {{is indicative of the}} racism that can occur whenever people of different races marry. This is evident in terms such as mulatto, quadroon, and octaroon, which seek to identify and quantify the exact amount of so-called inferior or tainted blood one has mixed in with the supposed genetically superior blood of the acceptable race. Because of this stigma, many Anglo-Indians (not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as kutcha butcha), have tried in the past and up to present day to pass as either Indian or English; this is known as racial passing. Historically, it has been more desirable for Anglo-Indians to pass as British, as they “would perhaps have better job opportunities and class privileges.” ...|$|R

As Richard Eldridge has noted, Toomer [...] "sought to transcend standard definitions of race. I think he never claimed {{that he was a}} white man,” Mr. Eldridge said. “He always claimed that he was a representative of a new, emergent race that was a combination of various races. He averred this virtually throughout his life.” William Andrews has noted he [...] "was one of the first writers to move beyond the idea that any black ancestry makes you black." ...|$|R

Gong agreed to help and she won the [...] "Best Performance Award" [...] in that competition. She was then invited by Goh Kheng Long (吳慶隆) to sign a recording contract for her debut album production in Taiwan. Gong had never travelled outside Singapore before and she admitted that she was shy in nature.

2500|$|In late 1979 Pullen, Adams, and Richmond <b>were</b> booked <b>to</b> play as {{a quartet}} for a [...] European tour of a few weeks' duration.

They <b>were</b> asked <b>to</b> bill {{themselves}} as a [...] "Mingus group", but not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as mere copyists, they declined and performed as the George Adams/Don Pullen Quartet. They played music that was more structured than Pullen normally favored, but the immediate rapport among them led to the group touring the world with unchanged personnel until the death of Richmond in early 1988. From very early in their first tour in 1979, and until 1985, the quartet made a dozen recordings for European labels, both {{in the studio and}} in concert. Of these, Earth Beams (1980), Live At The Village Vanguard (1983) and Decisions (1984) provide typically fine examples of their work at that period.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Human Face Recognition {{systems are}} an {{identification}} procedure {{in which a}} person is verified based on human traits. This paper describes a fast face detection algorithm with accurate result. Lip Tracking is one of the biometric systems based on which a genuine system can be developed. Since the uttering characteristics of an individual are unique and difficult to imitate, lip tracking holds an advantage of making the system secure. We use pre- recorded visual utterance of speakers has been generated and stored in the database for future verification. The entire project occurs in four different stages in which the first stage includes obtaining face region from the original image, the second stage includes mouth region extraction by background subtraction, the third stage includes key points extraction by considering the lip centroid as origin of co-ordinates and the fourth stage includes storing the obtained feature vector in the database. The user who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by the system provides the new live information, which is then compared with the existing template in the database. The feedback provided by the system will be ‗a match or a miss-match‘. This project will increase the accuracy level of biometric systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{original}} research that studied immigrant women who have been living in Liverpool since 2001. It deals with issues concerning the identity of immigrant women. One of the aims <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> if there <b>was</b> a difference between subjective perception and findings derived from an objective evaluation of their integration based on the collected data. The study, conducted in Liverpool in 2009, explores the choices immigrant women have made with respect to their preferred identity, i. e. by nationality, religion, or ethnicity. The inductive explorative research is postpositivist in approach and a questionnaire <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> collect primary data. The results have demonstrated how the various challenges immigrants face when moving to another country influence their choice of identity. Their preference of identification by nationality, religion and ethnic group helped to define the level of integration of these women within the wider society. The study has found that the way the respondents <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> depended on a number of factors; degree of integration, knowledge of the local language, and participation in the local community. The quantitative method and the multiple correspondence analyses have enabled the mapping profile of the sample and have demonstrated the existence of spatial urban self-segregation. The study shows that these women live in their diaspora space rather than within the wider community...|$|R

5000|$|Mr. Bergstrom {{was modeled}} on the {{physical}} appearance of Mike Reiss, a longtime writer and producer on the show. American actor Dustin Hoffman provided the voice of Mr. Bergstrom. Hoffman was {{not sure if he}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> with a cartoon show at the time, like many early guest stars on The Simpsons, and therefore used the pseudonym Sam Etic in the closing credits. Sam Etic is a play on the word semitic, alluding to the fact that both Hoffman and Mr. Bergstrom are Jewish. Brooks was the one who suggested the pseudonym, which Hoffman immediately liked. The cast of the show flew to New York to record the episode with Hoffman. Yeardley Smith, who provides the voice of Lisa, said she grew as an actress after working with Hoffman that day. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said he remembered that when the audio track of the episode came back, Hoffman's voice was too low on the singing parts. The staff were [...] "petrified" [...] that the singing scenes would not show up on air, so they had Hoffman re-record them when he was in Los Angeles.
