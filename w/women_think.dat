500|$|During Valentine's Day, Homer, Chief Wiggum, Dr. Hibbert, Moe, and Ned Flanders {{investigate}} what Apu {{is doing}} so they can stop it. They go around town and Flanders is {{thrown out of the}} group for suggesting they should be using their time to be more romantic to their wives instead of trying to sabotage Apu. Following Apu to the airport, the remaining group see Elton John there, and they think that he came to Springfield to perform a concert for Apu and Manjula at his insistence (in reality, he had to make an emergency landing because the chandelier on his plane was malfunctioning). However, Apu's actual plan is that he arranged for a skywriter to write [...] "I ♥ U MANJULA". During the trouble that ensues, Homer jumps on the plane during takeoff to try to stop the skywriter from spraying the message. When Homer destroys the plane's canister in mid-air it only sprayed part of the message - [...] "I ♥ U ★", which the other <b>women</b> <b>think</b> is for them. While Homer and the pilot fight, Marge remains unconvinced until the plane flies by and Homer drops out of it covered with roses after the plane flew out of control through a thorny rose patch, possibly giving Homer a collapsed lung. Nonetheless, Elton John is able to perform a private concert for Apu and Manjula, and their marriage is saved.|$|E
2500|$|Cocker {{credits his}} upbringing, almost {{exclusively}} in female company, for his interest in how <b>women</b> <b>think</b> {{and what they have}} to say. He wrote a song ("A Little Soul" [...] on This Is Hardcore) about being abandoned by his father, working briefly as a butler, and in 1998 travelled with his sister to Australia to meet {{him for the first time}} in nearly 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of <b>women</b> <b>think</b> you're a freak if you feel like that, and maybe I am strange but I never got that feeling. In some ways I wish I had that urge, because I adore children... I feel I can live quite happily with my decision." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cow's flesh, however, none {{of these}} [...] tribes ever taste, but abstain from it {{for the same reason}} as the Egyptians, neither do they any of them breed swine. Even at Cyrene, the <b>women</b> <b>think</b> it wrong to eat the flesh of the cow, honoring in this Isis, the Egyptian goddess, whom they worship both with fasts and festivals. The Barcaean women abstain, not from cow's flesh only, but also from the flesh of swine.|$|E
2500|$|One day First Man {{brought home}} a fine deer that he had killed. [...] First Woman said, [...] "I thank my vagina for this deer." [...] First Man demanded {{to know what she}} meant.

[...] "The <b>women</b> <b>think</b> they can live without us," [...] he told them. [...] "Let us see if that is true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the context}} of the Rwandan genocide, victims of sexual {{violence}} were predominantly attacked {{on the basis of their}} gender and ethnicity. The victims were mostly Tutsi women and girls, of all ages, while men were only seldomly the victims of war rape. Women were demonized in the anti-Tutsi propaganda prior to the 1994 genocide. The December 1990 issue of the newspaper Kangura published the [...] "Ten Commandments", four of which portrayed Tutsi women as tools of the Tutsi community, as sexual weapons that would be used by the Tutsi to weaken and ultimately to destroy the Hutu men. Gender based propaganda also included cartoons printed in newspapers that portrayed Tutsi women as sex objects. Examples of gender based hate propaganda used to incite war rape included statements by perpetrators such as [...] "You Tutsi <b>women</b> <b>think</b> that you are too good for us" [...] and [...] "Let us see what a Tutsi woman tastes like". Victims of war rape during the Rwandan genocide also included Hutu women considered moderates, such as Hutu women married to Tutsi men and Hutu women politically affiliated with the Tutsi. War rape also occurred regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation, with young or beautiful women being targeted based on their gender only. Sexual violence against men occurred significantly less frequently, but it frequently included the mutilation of their genitals, which were often displayed in public. The perpetrators of war rape during the Rwandan genocide were mainly members of the Hutu militia, the [...] "Interahamwe". Rapes were also committed by military personnel within the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), including the Presidential Guard, and civilians.|$|E
