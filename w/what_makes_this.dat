This profile is a Nash equilibrium. As argued above, on the equilibrium path play is a best response to a best response. However, playing Cournot {{would not have been}} the best response of the leader were it that the follower would play Stackelberg if it (the leader) played Stackelberg. In this case, the best response of the leader would be to play Stackelberg.

25|$|The {{works of}} Fra Angelico reveal {{elements}} that are both conservatively Gothic and progressively Renaissance. In the altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin, painted for the Florentine church of Santa Maria Novella, are all the elements that a very expensive altarpiece of the 14th century was expected to provide; a precisely tooled gold background, lots of azure, lots of vermilion and an obvious display of arsenic green. The workmanship of the gilded haloes and gold-edged robes is exquisite and all very Gothic. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> a Renaissance painting, as against Gentile da Fabriano's masterpiece, is the solidity, the three-dimensionality and naturalism of the figures and the realistic way in which their garments hang or drape around them. Even though it is clouds these figures stand upon, and not the earth, they do so with weight.|$|E

500|$|In the {{painting}} Virgin and Child with St. Anne the composition again {{picks up the}} theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as [...] "breathtakingly beautiful" [...] and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> painting unusual {{is that there are}} two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.|$|E

Leonard writes of this resurrection, [...] "Depression hangs like a pall over Tender Mercies [...] <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> film inspiring is that it is also about the joy of being found.... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants." [...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died.

500|$|Gregor the Overlander has {{received}} much critical acclaim, primarily {{for its new}} treatment of common themes in fantasy. School Library Journal called it [...] "an engrossing adventure for fantasy fans and for those new to the genre." [...] Common Sense Media gave it a 5/5 and credited the book's [...] "strong characters, vivid descriptions, flawless pacing, breathless excitement, laughs and scares, and a vision that makes this fantasy very different." [...] Readers have also praised the novel; Jane LeGak, an Amazon Reviewer, stated that, [...] "Rats and other wonderfully creepy creatures fill the story's dark underworld, but <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> book so wonderful is how human it is." [...] A. Reid, also from Amazon.com, praised the believable characters, saying, [...] "Gregor {{is one of the}} most warmly believable characters I've encountered in a children's novel in a long time."

[...] Speaking to The Guardian, he stated that although some people wouldn't like the book, and any failures would be blamed on him, [...] "I say that I win because I get to be part of this." [...] Through February 2008 Sanderson reread the entire series, posting his impressions of each book on his blog.

500|$|In {{reporting}} on Ballo's death, United Press International noted, [...] "Critics say the break-you-down-build-you-up recruitment tool of Scientologists is controversial." [...] The issue received {{a significant amount}} of coverage in Norway news publications; and media attention focused criticism on the Church of Scientology. Both Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted several cover stories investigating the matter. News media received criticism regarding the amount of coverage given to the incident. A representative of the National Association for Suicide Survivors in Norway regarded it as excessive. News editor of Dagbladet, Peter Raaum, defended the amount of news coverage given to the incident: [...] "We write about this because the survivor has made criticism of the Scientology test that Kaja took just before she took her life. The family wanted a debate about this. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> so important is this test. What kind of test is this? Is it so reprehensible, and significant to what happened? If it is, I mean it's something that's extremely important to focus on." [...] Ballo's family agreed to discuss the incident with the media. In an interview Ballo's father said he did not have issues with the case being front-page news in newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} let her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact that}} Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, yet who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} ranged from mixed to negative. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles [...] "is surely {{one of the}} most intense guys on TV", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were [...] "an odd way to build a mythology: the Big Secret seems to be that people in {{positions}} of power are evil and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea." [...] She gave it [...] "two out of four Expendable Gerbils." [...] io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her [...] "officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler". She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E

500|$|Many praised lyrics such as {{the ones}} in [...] "Look inside America/She's alright", and noting Albarn's [...] "obligatory nod to Beck, [...] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their {{attitude}} during the Britpop years. Erlewine wrote that [...] "Blur might be self-consciously eclectic, but Blur are at their best when they are trying to live up to their own pretensions, because of Damon Albarn's exceptional sense of songcraft and the band's knack for detailed arrangements that flesh out the songs to their fullest." [...] Alternative Press called it [...] "a whirl of weird esotericism, precious, precocious and impressively". Robert Christgau of The Village Voice was less enthusiastic and cited only [...] "Song 2" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". However, there was strong praise from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, who awarded the album four out of four stars. Ed Masley wrote that [...] "you can hear the new infatuation with indie rock stylings all over the latest release, with its clattering sonic collages and transistor radio vocals. At times, it's as though they've forgot that they're British. They are British though. It's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> eponymous record their greatest." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene was}} also a pivotal point in the {{development}} of Elsa's character and was initially planned to depict her becoming evil. Robert Lopez, who composed the song with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, explained, [...] "Elsa was going to go from being this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality down her whole life to saying, 'Screw it. I'm gonna be me.'" [...] They had wanted to use the song as a way {{to gain a better understanding}} of the character and what she would be like if she was no longer living in fear, which ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex. The final lyrics and Menzel's [...] "ability to be so fragile and vulnerable and then break into this powerhouse voice" [...] turned the plot around and led to Elsa being revised as a [...] "good" [...] character. She initially attempts to suppress her powers in order to avoid hurting others, particularly Anna, and when she is no longer able to do so, she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those around her. Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed. [...] "The strength of the family bond is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> story so powerful," [...] he explained, [...] "because it's her sibling who's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that's what it takes." ...|$|E
