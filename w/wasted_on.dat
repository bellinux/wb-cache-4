5|$|Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and {{incubation}} begins before clutch completion, {{which often}} leads {{to the death of}} the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure.|$|E

Continued records of tides and meteorological conditions were also required. An additional suggestion was for a geological survey of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the formation of such coral reefs.|$|E

5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E

5|$|Lee was {{met with}} resistance, because the audio {{industry}} at the time didn't believe cables made an audible difference in the sound and wire {{was something that was}} normally provided for free. Lee did demonstrations at retailers comparing Monster cables to zip cord to convince consumers that expensive equipment was <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> cheap wiring. Sales picked up as retailers saw the wiring as an opportunity for higher profit margins. This led Lee to provide incentives to retail salespeople to sell the cabling, rather than spend money on advertising. This led to criticisms that his business model creates aggressive salespeople.|$|E
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E

For leadership in the church, Peter turned increasingly to Ukrainians, who were more open to reform, but were not well loved by the Russian clergy. Peter implemented a law that stipulated that no Russian man could join a monastery {{before the age of}} 50. He felt that too many able Russian men were being <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> clerical work when they could be joining his new and improved army.|$|E

25|$|Italy {{produced}} 12,000 aircraft {{during the}} course of the war–this despite an economy that was based on agriculture rather than technology. However, much of this production capacity was <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> the failed development of the SIA 7. Italian army fighter pilots mostly found themselves flying either French Spad VIIs, Spad XIIIs, or Nieuports, or Macchi's knockoffs of Nieuports. The failure of the multi-purpose SIA 7 also left some Italian pilots flying obsolescent Farman and Voisin reconnaissance craft well into 1918, and paying the price in blood. Italian naval aviators, however, were supplied with seaplane fighters by Macchi, such as the M.5 or the M.7, that were the equals of landbound fighters.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground on}} the Gheluvelt Plateau had been churned by {{artillery}}-fire {{and turned into a}} sea of mud, flooded shell craters, fallen trees and barbed wire. Troops were quickly tired by rain, mud, massed artillery bombardments and lack of food and water; rapid relief of units spread the exhaustion through all the infantry despite the lines being held by fresh divisions. British artillery fired a preparatory bombardment from Polygon Wood to Langemarck but the German guns concentrated on the Gheluvelt Plateau. The British artillery was hampered by low cloud and rain, which made air observation extremely difficult and shells were <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> empty gun emplacements. The British 25th Division, 18th Division and the German 54th Division took over by 4 August but the German 52nd Reserve Division was not relieved; both sides was exhausted by 10 August. The 18th Division attacked on the right and some troops quickly reached their objectives but German artillery isolated the infantry around Inverness Copse and Glencorse Wood.|$|E
25|$|With the reopening of the theatres in 1660 {{after the}} Puritan ban, Dryden began writing plays. His first play The Wild Gallant {{appeared}} in 1663, {{and was not}} successful, but was still promising, and from 1668 on he was contracted to produce three plays {{a year for the}} King's Company in which he became a shareholder. During the 1660s and 1670s, theatrical writing was his main source of income. He led the way in Restoration comedy, his best-known work being Marriage à la Mode (1673), as well as heroic tragedy and regular tragedy, in which his greatest success was All for Love (1678). Dryden was never satisfied with his theatrical writings and frequently suggested that his talents were <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> unworthy audiences. He thus was making a bid for poetic fame off-stage. In 1667, around the same time his dramatic career began, he published Annus Mirabilis, a lengthy historical poem which described the English defeat of the Dutch naval fleet and the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was a modern epic in pentameter quatrains that established him as the preeminent poet of his generation, and was crucial in his attaining the posts of Poet Laureate (1668) and historiographer royal (1670).|$|E
40|$|Construction {{solid waste}} {{is a waste}} in solid form which is defined as useless or unwanted. It {{generated}} from building construction, demolition and refurbishment works. It has become as one of major environmental problems faced by the most municipalities. This paper based on study that has been conducted which involves types of solid wastes and {{factors that contribute to}} the <b>waste</b> <b>on</b> construction site. This study also focused on method used in managing solid <b>waste</b> <b>on</b> site. Two (2) methods have been used to achieve the objectives of this study which are questionnaire and interview. 34 respondents who are from construction company and local authorities in Pahang gave their feedback by answering the questionnaires. Data from questionnaire have been analyzed using average index (A!). Interview through site visit is carried out in Pekan, Pahang. It is done to get further information about methods used in managing <b>waste</b> <b>on</b> site. In conclusion, types of solid waste, factors contribute to <b>waste</b> <b>on</b> site and methods of managing solid waste have been identified. This study found that there are 8 types of construction <b>waste</b> <b>on</b> site such as concrete, asphalt, wood or timber, glass, plastic, metal or steel, roofing and brick or block. There are several factors contribute to <b>waste</b> <b>on</b> site such as lack of recycling facilities within the study region, mishandling, weather, inadequate storage, lack of communication between leader and worker, design changes,vandalism, ordering error, role of project manager and low quality material. The study result also shows the popular method choose by respondent to handle the solid waste which is dispose it and this is followed by reducing, recycling and reuse method...|$|R

500|$|On November 1, the Department of Defense said {{it would}} examine whether the {{disinformation}} had caused wasteful spending. A November 17 report by journalist Walter Pincus indicated that the review panel, led by Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, had not found [...] "any policy or weapon purchase decision that 'in and of itself' was shaped by tainted Soviet intelligence". The claim that billions of dollars had been <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> defense spending was deemed an overreaction. Former DIA chief Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper told the House Intelligence Committee that the intelligence affected no policy or weapons acquisition decisions, which was echoed by Haver.|$|E
500|$|Thus, {{when the}} action began {{and became a}} {{defensive}} rather than an offensive battle for the Russians, their heavy preponderance in artillery was <b>wasted</b> <b>on</b> a right wing that would never be attacked, while the French artillery did much to help win the battle. Toll and others would make attempts to cover up their mistakes in this deployment and later attempts by historians would compound the issue. Indeed, Clausewitz too complained about Toll's dispositions being so narrow and deep that needless losses were incurred from artillery fire. The Russian position therefore was just about [...] long with about 80,000 of the 1st Army {{on the right and}} 34,000 of the 2nd Army on the left.|$|E
