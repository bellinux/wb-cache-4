25|$|One issue {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the real economy (producing goods and services) and the financial economy (trading assets). Some argue, like Marx did, that the tendency of the rate of profit to fall applies only to the sphere of the capitalist industrial production of commodities, not to the whole capitalist economy. Thus, it is argued, it is eminently possible that while industrial profitability stagnates, average profitability in activities external to the sphere of industrial production increases. In fact, Michael Hudson claims that in the United States, only about a quarter of workers' gross wages is spent on the purchase of actual goods and services. All the rest is spent on the payment of rents and mortgages, retirement schemes and insurance, loans and interest, and various taxes Costas Lapavitsas adds to this insight that not just household liabilities, but also household assets have to be looked at: the rich 20% of the world's workers have substantial deposits and savings invested with banks and retirement funds, so that, {{on both sides of the}} ledger, they become fully dependent on finance capital. Since labor incomes rose strongly in rich countries along with population growth in the second half of the 20th century, very large savings became available in retirement funds, representing an additional source of capital invested for profit worldwide and increasing the economic power of the finance industry. In 2008, the world's total tradeable financial assets (stocks, debt securities and bank deposits) were estimated at $178 trillion, more than three times the value of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world produces in a year. In June 2017, the world's total public and private debt was estimated at US$217 trillion, again more than three times the value of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world produces in a year. If one assumes a grand-average net profit rate of 5% on this global debt, the profit made from global debt is roughly equal to the annual national income of China. This has created a world in industrialized countries that is very different from the orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist analysis of the commodity, where workers simply exchange their commodity labor power for a wage to buy a bundle of consumable commodities with.|$|E
500|$|Although Van der Byl was now {{prepared}} {{to say that he}} supported the transition to majority rule, he was quick to put restrictions on it when interviewed in April 1977. He insisted that majority rule would only be possible on a [...] "very qualified franchise—that's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing is about", and also said that any settlement must be endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the existing House of Assembly (which was largely elected by white Rhodesians). Over the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Ten started as {{instrumental}} compositions that Vedder added lyrics to after he joined the band. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "All I really believe in is this fucking moment, like right now. And that, actually, is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> album talks about." [...] Vedder's lyrics for Ten deal with subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. The album also tackles social concerns such as homelessness ("Even Flow") {{and the use of}} psychiatric hospitals ("Why Go"). The song [...] "Jeremy" [...] and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.|$|E

500|$|... "Lost!" [...] {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} songs the band worked on for the album. The Blur song [...] "Sing" [...] was a source of inspiration in having provided a starting point for writing [...] "Lost!". While in Detroit, Michigan, for a concert tour, the band was listening to [...] "Sing" [...] in their dressing room. Once they went on stage for a soundcheck, they thought of writing a song based from it. According to guitarist Jonny Buckland, [...] "We recorded some of it in a church up the road that's now a studio. In a huge room with a piano and organ going at the same time." [...] In an interview with The Sun, Martin said, [...] "The line in this song 'Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost' is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> record came out of because we were feeling {{down at the end of}} the last tour. That line arrived and it was, 'OK, that's how we kinda feel. We know we can improve." [...] The ensuing track evolved in different versions.|$|E
500|$|Ray Harding {{wrote the}} script for [...] "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that {{it is one of}} only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The {{producers}} asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that [...] "the magic of the episode" [...] is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled [...] "The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> scene was about." [...] The episode was shot [...] "in great secrecy" [...] three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating [...] "a halo effect" [...] around Charlene as she walked up the aisle.|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The masks {{influence}} the very {{way in which}} realities are categorized. People's theorizing about the world also becomes detached from the relevant contexts, and the interpretation of reality then involves multiple [...] "layers" [...] of meanings, in which [...] "part of the story" [...] hides the [...] "whole story". <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story is, may itself become an almost impenetrable mystery, about which it may indeed be argued that it cannot be solved. The real truth about a person may be considered unknowable, {{but as long as}} the person can function normally, it may not matter; one is judged simply according to the function performed.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo {{recordings}} which later became informally {{known as the}} [...] "Bedroom Tapes". Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material {{has been described as}} [...] "schizophrenia on tape," [...] and [...] "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state." [...] Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: [...] "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s." [...] Brian's daughter Wendy remembers, [...] "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song." [...] Her sister Carnie has recounted: [...] "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room... thinking about something. I always wanted to know what he was thinking, you know? Who knows what he was thinking in his head? ... We got used to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> environment was. It was very musical; there was always a piano going.

2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of... the way you manipulate and distort the documents".|$|E
