His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> the streets incognito among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research. He used incidents from his life and the people around him, in works like Eugénie Grandet and Louis Lambert.|$|E

5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} look for Simorg, the Bird of Ages, on the {{mountain}} Kaf. While wandering, he meets an old woman, Maimuna, who is a sorceress. She casts a spell upon him and he {{is sent to the}} land of Mohareb, by now an evil Sultan. However, Maimuna's sister, Khawla, knows that if Thalaba is killed that Mohareb would also be killed and she seeks to kill Thalaba to remove Mohareb. Finding this out, Mohareb joins with Thalaba and returns the ring. After telling Thalaba to turn to the darker powers, Thalaba leaves. Khawla attempts to user her magic to kill Thalaba, but the ring protects him. When Maimuna tries to user her own magic against Thalaba, she witnesses the goodness of the universe and represents her evil ways. She repays him by using her magic to bring him back to the mountain, and Thalaba is able to return to his search for Simorg. After <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> snow, Thalaba comes across the Font of Fire with the sleeping Laila trapped inside. It turns out she was placed there by her father, the sorcerer Okba and one of the murderers of Thalaba's family.|$|E
5|$|The storyline of Shuffle! {{follows the}} life of Rin Tsuchimi, a normal seventeen-year-old second-year high school student who finds himself sought after {{by a variety of}} girls. Eight years prior to the onset of the story, he lost his parents in a car {{accident}} that also took {{the life of}} Kaede Fuyou's mother. From that point onwards, he began living with her. At around the same time he lost his parents, he met Lisianthus and Nerine at different times who each were accompanying their fathers on a diplomatic business in the human world. Each girl became lost after <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> the human world. During that time, Rin befriended each girl after playing with them for a day.

25|$|The novelty and {{inventiveness}} of {{the last}} years of the century are best seen in the anonymous La Mariane du Filomene (1596) which mixes the frame-tale, amorous sentiment, dreams, and pastoral elements {{to tell the story of}} a man <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> the Parisian countryside trying to forget the woman who betrayed him.|$|E

25|$|While working {{briefly in}} a {{department}} store, Cotten helped a child <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> the aisles find her mother. The child was Penny Seeger, and the mother was the composer Ruth Crawford Seeger. Soon after this, Cotten again began working as a maid for Ruth Crawford Seeger and Charles Seeger and caring for their children, Mike, Peggy, Barbara, and Penny. While working with the Seegers (a voraciously musical family that included Pete Seeger, a son of Charles from a previous marriage) she remembered her own guitar playing from 40 years prior {{and picked up the}} instrument again and relearned to play it, almost from scratch.|$|E
25|$|As these {{cultures}} {{interacted with}} each other {{over a period of}} nearly 2000 years, there is little evidence of open warfare, although there is speculation that the huge Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements grew as large as they did during their later phase of their culture as a result of providing a stronger defense against any potential raiding conducted by nomadic Proto-Indo-European groups that might have been <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> their neighborhood. Still, remarkably, almost no actual weapons have been found in any Cucuteni-Trypillia sites, neither have there been skeletal remains discovered that would indicate the person had died violently (arrowheads lodged in the bones, crushed skulls, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Born Albert Léon Gleizes {{and raised}} in Paris, {{he was the son}} of a fabric {{designer}} who ran a large industrial design workshop. He was also the nephew of Léon Comerre, a successful portrait painter who won the 1875 Prix de Rome. The young Albert Gleizes did not like school and often skipped classes to idle away the time writing poetry and <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> the nearby Montmartre cemetery. Finally, after completing his secondary schooling, Gleizes spent four years in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of the French army (Abbeville, Picardie) then began pursuing a career as a painter. Gleizes began to paint self-taught around 1901 in the Impressionist tradition. His first landscapes from around Courbevoie appear particularly inspired by Alfred Sisley or Camille Pissarro. Although clearly related to Pissarro in technique, Gleizes' particular view-points as well as the composition and conception of early works represent a clear departure from the style of late Impressionism. The density with which these works are painted and their solid framework suggest affinities with Divisionism which were often noted by early critics.|$|E
25|$|For those {{grounded}} in the RPG tradition, the very first release of Call of Cthulhu created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by Dungeons & Dragons, which often involved the characters <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced {{the concept of the}} Onion Skin: Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the Player Characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, CoC assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe {{way to deal with the}} vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run CoC campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.|$|E

500|$|Griswold {{was born}} to Rufus and Deborah (Wass) Griswold on February 13, 1815, in Vermont, near Rutland, and raised a strict Calvinist in the hamlet of Benson. He was the twelfth of fourteenchildren and {{his father was a}} farmer and shoemaker. In 1822, the family sold the Benson farm and moved to nearby Hubbardton. As a child, Griswold was complex, unpredictable, and reckless. He left home when he was 15, calling himself a [...] "solitary soul, <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> the world, a homeless, joyless outcast".|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{criticism}} of Werehog levels, further aspects of the game were criticised, contributing to the mixed review scores. The quests that players must undertake in hub-towns were described as [...] "inane" [...] and [...] "tedious", where [...] "figuring out what happens next involves aimlessly <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> towns and speaking to citizens, {{only to discover that}} most of them don't know what we're looking for". The story and overall tone of the game, including the new character Chip, were criticised, some remarking that it was too juvenile, or comparable to that of a Saturday morning cartoon.|$|E
