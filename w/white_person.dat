5|$|In {{his address}} to the state {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated {{the repeal of the}} state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks. He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person on the board of trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only <b>white</b> <b>person</b> included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|U. S. v. Rhodes (1866), one of {{the first}} Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of {{provisions}} in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whitesâ€”an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a <b>white</b> <b>person</b> accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be abolished. With In Re Turner (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} {{study was to investigate}} differences between black and <b>white</b> <b>persons</b> with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with regard to age, gender, oral site affected, and histopathological degree of differentiation; and to compare these clinicopathological parameters between persons younger and older than 40 years in a South African population sample from the greater Johannesburg area. Material and Methods: The histopathological reports of 510 cases of OSCC during the period 1995 - 2002 were retrospectively evaluated, and the data regarding age, gender, ethnicity/race, oral site affected, and degree of histopathological differentiation were recorded and statistically analyzed for differences between black and <b>white</b> <b>persons,</b> and between persons younger and older than 40 years of age. Results: Statistically significantly, black persons were diagnosed with OSCC at a younger mean age (57 years) than <b>white</b> <b>persons</b> (61 years) (P = 0. 0086). The difference between male: female (M: F) ratio in black (3. 74 : 1) and <b>white</b> <b>persons</b> (1. 96 : 1) was statistically significant (P = 0. 0041). <b>White</b> <b>persons</b> had a significantly higher proportion of SCC of the lower lip than black persons (P < 0. 0001). Conclusion: OSCC was diagnosed at a younger age in black than in white persons; the proportion of black males in the black population group was greater than that of white males in the white population group; and the proportion of SCC of the lips was higher in younger than in older persons...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review the}} {{available}} information on prevalence, complications, and mortality of {{non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus}} and primary and secondary prevention activities in black persons, Hispanic persons, Native Americans, and Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE search from 1976 to 1994 through the PlusNet search system. STUDY SELECTION: Use of the key words non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the names of each specific minority group, socioeconomic status, acculturation, genetics, diet, complications, mortality, treatment, and intervention (lifestyle or medication) produced 290 unduplicated articles. Additional articles cited in the original articles were also included. DATA EXTRACTION: Risk factors, incidence, prevalence, complications, and mortality of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. DATA SYNTHESIS: All minorities, except natives of Alaska, have a prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is two to six times {{greater than that of}} <b>white</b> <b>persons.</b> Most studies show an increased prevalence of nephropathy that can be as much as six times higher than that of <b>white</b> <b>persons.</b> Retinopathy has variably higher rates in black persons, Hispanic persons, and Native Americans. Amputations are done more frequently among black <b>persons</b> than among <b>white</b> <b>persons</b> (9. 0 per 1000 compared with 6. 3 per 1000), and Pima Indians have 3. 7 times more amputations than do <b>white</b> <b>persons.</b> Diabetes-related mortality is higher for minorities than for <b>white</b> <b>persons,</b> and the rate is increasing. The relative importance of genetic heritage, diet, exercise, socioeconomic status, culture, language, and access to health care in the prevalence, incidence, and mortality of diabetes is not clear. Studies of interventions in minority populations are in progress. CONCLUSION: Diabetes should be treated as a public health problem for minority populations...|$|R

25|$|The 20th-century one-drop rule made it {{relatively}} {{difficult for}} anyone of known Black ancestry {{to be accepted}} as White.

40|$|Oral leukoplakia is {{the most}} common {{potentially}} malignant oral lesion.

The aim of this study is to analyse the differences in the clinicopathological features of oral leukoplakia in different racial groups in the greater Johannesburg area of South Africa, with special emphasis on the black population. Only 14 % of oral leukoplakia occurred in black persons compared to 80 % in <b>white</b> <b>persons.</b> In contrast to <b>white</b> <b>persons,</b> black persons were diagnosed with oral leukoplakia at a younger age; there were more males affected than females; and the proportion of idiopathic leukoplakias was greater.
