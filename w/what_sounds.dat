25|$|Foley {{is another}} method of adding sound effects. Foley {{is more of}} a {{technique}} for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect, but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen, such as footsteps. With this technique the action onscreen is essentially recreated to try to match it as closely as possible. If done correctly it is very hard for audiences to tell <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> were added and <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> were originally recorded (location sound).|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no {{surviving}} record of <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> moa made, some idea of their calls can be gained from fossil evidence. The trachea of moa were supported by many small rings of bone known as tracheal rings. Excavation of these rings from articulated skeletons has shown {{that at least two}} moa genera (Euryapteryx and Emeus) exhibited tracheal elongation, that is, their trachea were up to 1 metre (3ft) long and formed a large loop within the body cavity. These are the only ratites known to exhibit this feature, which is also present in several other bird groups including swans, cranes, and guinea fowl. The feature is associated with deep, resonant vocalisations that can travel long distances.|$|E

500|$|According to {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra, [...] "then they would go off with Alan and David in a more intimate recording environment and perfect their vocals".

Further, the screenplay also {{gives the impression that}} the successful original production of Show Boat, which Ziegfeld produced, closed because of the Great Depression. In fact Show Boat ended its original 1927 run in the spring of 1929 and the stock market crash did not occur until October of that year. It was the 1932 revival of the show (also produced by Ziegfeld shortly before his death), not the original production, that was affected by the Depression.|$|E

500|$|That {{is not to}} say his operas did {{not come}} as great innovations. <b>What</b> <b>sounds</b> to a modern {{listener}} as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, Nabucco, came as a something entirely new. Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] is an example of this.|$|E

[...] "Premature Burial", [...] "ostensibly inspired" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name, is the track from which the album title had been taken. It is, in Siouxsie's words, [...] "an expression of claustrophobia, of being hemmed in both by society's and people's limitations". For the writer Mark Paytress, the line [...] "We're all sisters and brothers" [...] looked like {{a mockery of the}} Summer of Love.

[...] Sal Cinquemani, from the same publication, felt that the song [...] "isn't retro so much as retrograde, starting off with some crafty Art of Noise synth tones before morphing into <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> like the theme song to an early-'90s sitcom, or an inspirational sports flick, as sung by Bonnie Tyler."

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce.

Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News called the song [...] "one of those polarizing songs, with its Ethel Merman-like synchronized vocal sweeps that do suggest the aquatic, in a 1950s sort of way". Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman labeled the track as a [...] "strikingly beautiful" [...] song. Alex Ross, reporter writing for The New Yorker stated that with [...] "Oceania", Björk [...] "confirmed {{her status as}} the ultimate musical cosmopolitan", acquainted with Karlheinz Stockhausen and the Wu-Tang Clan. Matthew Gasteier from Prefix magazine called the track [...] "the best song on the album", whilst complimenting [...] "its swooping chorus [...] recalls the migration of birds or the time-elapsed drifting of icebergs, a swirl of beauty and power crashing down onto and then rising above the mix. It culminates in the near screech that leads into the sexy-spooky coda". According to Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club, in a positive review, [...] "the electronic flourish strays from her organic vocal focus, but Björk summons {{the same kind of}} tingle with choral language" [...] in the song, [...] "which finds The London Choir reacting to <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> like a thrilling slow-motion circus act".|$|E

500|$|... "Rain" [...] is a pop ballad with {{influence}} from trip hop and new-age music. Styled in adult contemporary format, {{the song is}} more [...] "friendly" [...] in its sound than the other singles released from Erotica. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is written in the key note of E major. The song's tempo {{is set in a}} moderate pace, but not too fast and has a metronome of 92 beats per minute. [...] "Rain" [...] begins with Madonna singing [...] "I feel it, it's coming", and followed by the chord progression of Esus2–A6/9–Bsus in the chorus and later A–B–E in the verse. A dark sounding C minor string and an echoing hi-hat accompanies Madonna's vocals, which are sung in her lowest register. The song's arrangement captures turbulent elements associated with rain (such as thunder), orchestral stabs that invokes crisp lightning bolts, and a surging bridge segue driven by <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> like electric guitar snarls. A key change happens towards the end from B major to C major, followed by two spoken parts and a harmony alongside it. The coda has another melody with it, and the song ends in a group chorus without the harmonies.|$|E

[...] In a review of the entire fifth season, Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] was the [...] "most striking" [...] of the season's stand-alone episodes. Todd VanDerWerff awarded the episode with an [...] "A" [...] grade, and, despite noting the silliness of the story and the fact that most of the characters function as stereotypes, wrote that [...] "'Prometheus' just works".
