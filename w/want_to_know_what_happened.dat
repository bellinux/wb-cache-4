But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. [...] "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch… If they say, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to this girl'… I want to help them find out." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later {{went on to say that}} she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

60|$|Another {{point is}} worth {{thinking}} of, besides {{the reduction of}} history for your purposes to a comprehensive body of rightly grouped generalities. Dr. Arnold says somewhere that he wishes the public might {{have a history of}} our present state of society traced backwards. It is the present that really interests us; it is the present that we seek to understand and to explain. I do not in the least <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in the past, except as it enables me to see my way more clearly through what is happening to-day. I want to know what men thought and did in the thirteenth century, not out of any dilettante or idle antiquarian's curiosity, but because the thirteenth century {{is at the root of}} what men think and do in the nineteenth. Well then, it cannot be a bad educational rule to start from what is most interesting, and to work from that outwards and backwards. By beginning with the present we see more clearly what are the two things best worth attending to in history--not party intrigues nor battles nor dynastic affairs, nor even many acts of parliament, but the great movements of the economic forces of a society on the one hand, and on the other the forms of religious opinion and ecclesiastical organisation. All the rest are important, but their importance is subsidiary.|$|E

50|$|After some MFIs {{authorities}} have conducted hasty mass burials, and {{research has shown}} this is a generally unsatisfactory response. Mass burials are usually not required for public health reasons, they increase distress among survivors and interfere with long-term community recovery. In all cultures there are customs and rituals {{for dealing with the}} dead. Universally survivors <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to their loved ones, and that their loved ones' remains were treated with respect. These are important reasons to plan for mass fatality management.|$|E

5000|$|As in the United States, the community's {{response}} to {{news of the}} Holocaust was muted for decades. Bialystok (2000) argues that in the 1950s the community was [...] "virtually devoid" [...] of discussion. Although one in seven Canadian Jews were survivors and their children, most Canadian Jews [...] "did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> and few survivors {{had the courage to}} tell them.' He argues that the main obstacle to discussion was [...] "an inability to comprehend the event.

5000|$|As {{with most}} of her serials, Watase planned the basic story line of Ceres {{through to the end}} before {{beginning}} work. She notes that it is easier to work this way, but that even with planning sometimes the characters will [...] "move on their own" [...] and refuse to follow her original plans. When she reaches the end of the work, though, she can understand why they did so. Watase noted that one of the hardest parts of writing a serial manga was having to plan for a cliffhanger {{at the end of each}} chapter. She wanted each one to make the reader <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> next, so they would want to keep reading.|$|E
50|$|Snow marries Charming {{and the two}} {{are happy}} for a time. He {{promises}} her anything she desires as a wedding gift; to his surprise, she asks him for fencing lessons. Feeling that this is inappropriate for a woman, particularly a noble one, Charming attempts to dissuade her, but she remains resolute and he agrees. Time passes and Snow becomes adept at sword fighting. About this time a dwarf corpse is discovered, roughly hacked to death. Realizing that the King of the Dwarfs will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to his subject, Charming orders an investigation. A week later a second body is located; stabbed rather than hacked. By the time the fourth body is located, the King of the Dwarfs is becoming increasingly angry at {{the death of his}} subjects, and threatens the possibility of war if the perpetrator are not found. Charming learns that the four dead were brothers who shared with their other brothers a 'diversion cabin' deep within the woods, where they could visit the upper world and indulge in certain vices in private, including the abduction of the occasional local peasant girl. Snow, in the meantime, tells her husband that she wishes to discontinue their lessons; claiming that she has progressed as far as she felt she was likely to.|$|E

5000|$|Nawa {{describes}} {{the story of}} Darya, a 12-year-old opium bride in the Ghoryan district given by her father to a creditor 34 years her senior to liquidate his opium debts. The girl is initially resistant to the marriage, telling Nawa, [...] "I {{do not want to}} go with this man. Can you please help me?" [...] She ultimately concedes to her father's wishes and marries the smuggler who lives hours away. After several months of no contact between Darya and the family, her mother beseeches Nawa to search for her. Nawa attempts to find the child, saying, [...] "I was immediately attracted to the young girl because she was a mystery and a victim who needed to be saved from barbaric traditions. I thought it was my job as an outsider from the West to rescue her." [...] But ultimately, she must give up because of danger from the child's husband and because the search takes her to the Helmand Province, a perilous place. Nawa believes that Darya will save herself by standing up to her husband, escaping him, or discovering how to cope with her situation. She writes, [...] "Darya offers hope for change. I will always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to her, and perhaps someday I will." ...|$|E
