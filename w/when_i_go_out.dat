25|$|Leigh Fermor {{translated}} the manuscript The Cretan Runner written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have I heard of Englishmen singing Greek songs like this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; {{it is as if}} they want to embrace Paddy wherever he goes.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> after deer I {{am going}} to make sure of where I am traveling," [...] said Whopper. [...] "Don't catch me getting lost fifteen miles from nowhere again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had the day made to order," [...] sang out Andy. And then he added, with a grin: [...] "It never rains <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{unless the}} water {{happens to be}} coming down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I laid both despatches on {{the desk}} in my room <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{to make sure that}} Margaret had {{everything}} comfortable before she started." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1981 {{interview}} with The Advocate, he boasted that [...] "recently I jacked off almost continuously for five days--except for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> for food." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think he}} swore, I am sure he groaned distressfully <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{with what was}} due to me. Meeting Harry I told him the story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Philippa," [...] he began, [...] "you {{know that}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on these fishing expeditions, I also {{put in some}} work at the new chart which I am so anxious {{to prepare for the}} fishermen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was a {{gleam of}} {{sunshine}} when I {{got out of}} the van yesterday. I never knew before what sunshine was. I hope it will be a sunny day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> for the last time!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's trite!' said Leonard, {{patting her}} fondly. 'I {{like you to}} do--as you call it--Miss May does, and every one that is worth anything. I say, Ave, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to the islands, you are coming too?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The day I came here. In the {{undergrowth}} {{at the back}} of the enclosure, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> in the evening. The head was completely wrung off." ...|$|R
60|$|Twelve days passed, and {{one morning}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{to feed the}} chickens, I saw the red Kaffir with the scar on his face seated beyond the stoep taking snuff.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm dead broke," [...] Carrots replied, mournfully. [...] "I {{spent some}} of my money <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with the farmer, an' {{the rest of it}} while I was walkin' in yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You’d {{better not}} go out o’ doors to-day, then," [...] said Mr. Gribble. [...] "Don’t stand about in draughts; and I’ll fetch you in a bottle of cough mixture <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> What about a lay-down on the sofa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twelve; {{then there}} would be just time to send him to Portsmouth, get him {{prepared}} for a naval cadetship, then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with Sir David Horfield, I could take him under my own eye, and make a man of him at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Kit {{agreed and}} {{hesitated for a}} moment or two while his face got red. [...] "You couldn't go now, but I'm coming back. Suppose I get on and my pay is good? Will you marry me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> again?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} front yard I found Mr. Poplington and Jone sitting on a little stone bench, for they was tired, and I told them about that young woman and Davy.|$|R
60|$|I was a {{free man}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of the Court; but I was a beggar--I, Captain Stubbs, of the bold North Bungays, {{did not know where}} I could get a bed, or a dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't believe it," [...] the {{man said}} huskily. [...] "Just to think! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> this morning there was Jane and the kids, as well and as happy as ever, and there, where are they now?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{am in the}} Law, but not of it. I can't exactly {{make out}} what it means. I sit in Westminster Hall {{sometimes}} (in character) from ten to four; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of Court, I don't know whether I am standing on my wig or my boots.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll go {{anywhere}} {{so long as}} I {{can get out of}} this beastly country,' he answered wearily. 'I feel people are looking at me in the street <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> and they're saying to one another: there's the son of that swindling rotter who was sentenced to seven years.' ...|$|E
60|$|The prison {{style is}} {{absolutely}} and entirely wrong. I would {{give anything to}} be able to alter it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> I intend to try. But {{there is nothing in the}} world so wrong but that the spirit of humanity, which is the spirit of love, the spirit of the Christ who is not in churches, may make it, if not right, at least possible to be borne without too much bitterness of heart.|$|E
6000|$|The steward {{shook his}} head helplessly. [...] "He was 'ere <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> last night," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "When I came back the room was empty and I was told as 'e was upstairs in my bed." ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{know how}} {{the rest of the night}} passed. I only find my memory again when the morning came, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> by myself to breathe the crisp wintry air on the open moor behind the inn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Jim replied, [...] "we {{might get}} one of the big boats through it now; but it's going to be worse, presently. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> last year, with a boat to the brig which was driven ashore, it was worse than this.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was loud}} in his praises of the affability of Scott. [...] "He'll come here sometimes," [...] said he, [...] "with great folks in his company, an' the first I know {{of it is}} his voice, calling out 'Johnny!--Johnny Bower!'--and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> I am sure to be greeted with a joke or a {{pleasant}} word. Hell stand and crack and lauff wi' me, just like an auld wife--and to think that {{of a man who}} has such an awfu' knowledge o' history!" ...|$|E
60|$|JONES. [Dropping the box {{onto the}} table.] You mind what you're sayin'! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> I 'll take and chuck {{it in the}} water along with that there purse. I 'ad it when I was in liquor, and for {{what you do when}} you 're in liquor you're not responsible-and that's Gawd's truth as you ought to know. I don't want the thing--I won't have it. I took it out o' spite. I 'm no thief, I tell you; and don't you call me one, or it'll be the worse for you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot do that, sir, though I {{will return}} the first thing. There is, {{lying on my}} table, a paper with the {{particulars}} and names of the persons I saw meet in this hut, and a request to my father that, if I do not return in the morning, he will at once lay this before the council. I place it there every day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> in order that, if I should be seized and carried off by Mocenigo's people, I should have some means of forcing them to let me go.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} kept me awake so late that night. As a {{consequence}} I overslept myself. I {{had managed to}} redeem my reputation on this point, but here it was lost again. I felt cross and foolish and cantankerous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{was sitting}} on deck <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> and his missis too, but neither of 'em spoke a word. I picked up my broom and went on sweeping, <b>when</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> 'eard a voice at the gate I thought I knew, and in came my wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, an' {{the way he}} shot it too," [...] {{said the}} seaman, laying aside his rifle, [...] "would have made even a monkey stare with astonishment. Has Leather come back, by the way? I see'd him goin' full sail through the woods <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> this mornin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I am all right!" [...] he said; [...] "but {{it is not}} a {{pleasant}} thing having had such a close shave of being sent to Siberia; and it isn't only that. No doubt the police feel that they owe me a grudge for having been the means of this fellow, whoever he was, slipping through their fingers, and I shall be a suspected person for a long time. Of course it is only fancy, but I am always thinking there is some one following me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> I know it is nonsense, but I can't get rid of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{a letter}} to Wordsworth, written in the year 1815, Charles Lamb said: [...] "How I can be brought in, felo de omittendo, for that ending to the Boy-builders is a mystery. I can't say {{positively}} now, I only know that no line oftener or readier occurs than that 'Light-hearted boys, I will build up a Giant with you.' It comes naturally, with a warm holiday, and the freshness of the blood. It is a perfect summer amulet, that I tie round my legs to quicken their motion <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> a maying." [...] (See Letters of Charles Lamb, edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. i. p. 287.)--Ed.|$|E
60|$|You may realise it when I {{say that}} had I been {{released}} last May, as I tried to be, I {{would have left}} this place loathing it and every official in it with a bitterness of hatred that would have poisoned my life. I have had a year longer of imprisonment, but humanity {{has been in the}} prison along with us all, and now <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> I shall always remember great kindnesses that I have received here from almost everybody, and on the day of my release I shall give many thanks to many people, and ask to be remembered by them in turn.|$|E
60|$|None {{of us was}} talkative that evening, but fervent good wishes {{followed}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with the east-bound train the next day, and until the dusky pines hid her, closing round the track, I saw cousin Alice's slight figure with her face turned toward the departing train.|$|R
6000|$|... "I sold it {{for thirty}} bob," [...] ses Bob Pretty, [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> this evening <b>I</b> left {{the money on}} my bedroom mantelpiece--one pound, two arf-crowns, two two-shilling pieces, and two sixpences. My wife and her sister both saw it there. That they'll swear to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{there is}} only enough for you," [...] he said. [...] "If I were to have some, and Cousin Josiah, and all the others, {{there would be a}} very little share for you; besides, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> the day before yesterday, I had as much as I could eat." ...|$|R
