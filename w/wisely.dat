5|$|God {{in whose}} hands are {{the hearts of}} Kings, who art the consoler of the humble and the {{protector}} of all who hope in thee, grant to our Queen Elizabeth and to the Christian people to celebrate <b>wisely</b> the triumph of thy goodness {{so that they may}} be always renewed to glory through thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Marathon was a {{watershed}} in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten. It also highlighted {{the superiority of}} the more heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and showed their potential when used <b>wisely.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, <b>wisely</b> researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower {{the costs of}} mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be <b>wisely</b> spent {{and need to be}} widely shared.|$|E
5|$|When Sugriva {{challenges}} Vali to a duel, Tara <b>wisely</b> advises Vali not {{to accept}} because of the former's alliance with Rama—the hero of the Ramayana and an avatar of the god Vishnu—but Vali does not heed her, and dies from Rama's arrow, shot {{at the behest of}} Sugriva. The Ramayana and its later adaptations emphasize Tara's lamentation. While in most vernacular versions, Tara casts a curse on Rama by the power of her chastity, in some versions, Rama enlightens Tara.|$|E
5|$|As a {{teenager}} John proves his worth and is gradually granted positions of authority, first as Master of the Falcons, then as Lord Warden of the East Marches and Constable of England. He takes all three positions seriously, devoting {{himself to the}} acquirement of knowledge necessary for effective administration. He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and <b>wisely</b> gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. He understands that his administrative skill is more useful than acting as a soldier, and earns the respect of the people under his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{eventually}} {{concentrated on}} the field of law, starting with work on wills and deeds. By 1933, he was senior partner in a 20-man Midtown Manhattan law firm. He developed the business habits of smoking cigars and of answering questions only after taking two puffs. During the Great Depression, O'Malley represented bankrupt companies and enriched himself, while building his thriving law practice. He invested <b>wisely</b> in firms such as the Long Island Rail Road, Brooklyn Borough Gas Company, the New York Subways Advertising Company, a building materials firm, a beer firm and some hotels. His success begot both influence and attention. The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O'Malley.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to <b>wisely</b> use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be <b>wisely</b> used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu (pinyin: Sun Zi; c. 544 BC – 496 BC) was {{a native}} of the Qi state (now Huimin county in Shandong) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, that was characterised by warring factions and a {{fragmented}} state. He {{came to the attention of}} King He Lu of Wu, who was impressed by his 13-chapter military treatise, The Art of War. In 512 BC, He Lu made Sun Tzu his Commander-in-Chief of the Wu army. For almost 20 years, the armies of Wu were victorious over their hereditary enemies, the kingdoms of Chu and Yue. In 496 BC, after He Lu died from his wounds in battle, his son, Fu Chai succeeded him. After numerous victories in battles, Fu Chai became arrogant and began to indulge in merrymaking. In time, the king started to disregard Sun Tzu's counsel and began to distance himself from Sun Tzu. Sensing this, Sun Tzu <b>wisely</b> gave up his position and left Wu for Qi in retirement. Fu Chai and his generals did not follow Sun Tzu's precepts and his kingdom was subsequently conquered by Chu in 473 BC. Out of shame, Fu Chai committed suicide after he had fled with the remnants of his defeated army.|$|E
5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author <b>wisely</b> and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E

25|$|The Choosing <b>Wisely</b> {{campaign}} {{makes no}} provision to scientifically research its own efficacy, but academic centers are {{making plans to}} independently report {{on the impact of}} the campaign. The campaign has been cited as being part of a broader movement including many comparable campaigns. The German Network for Evidence Based Medicine considered adapting concepts from the program into the German healthcare system. In April 2014, Choosing <b>Wisely</b> Canada launched. Choosing <b>Wisely</b> Canada is organized by the Canadian Medical Association and the University of Toronto, and is chaired by Dr. Wendy Levinson. The services targeted by the Choosing <b>Wisely</b> lists have broad variance in how much impact they can have on patients' care and costs.|$|E
25|$|By 2015 and {{following}} the Choosing <b>Wisely</b> precedent established in the United States, health leaders from Australia, Canada, Denmark, England, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Wales committed to bring ideas from the Choosing <b>Wisely</b> and sometimes even the actual campaign itself into their own countries.|$|E
25|$|Garbo had {{invested}} <b>wisely,</b> primarily {{in stocks and}} bonds, and left her entire estate, $32,042,429—$57,000,000 by 2013 rates—to her niece, Gray Reisfield.|$|E
25|$|Mr Hasan <b>wisely</b> {{handed over}} {{executive}} captaincy duties to Lubomir Kavalek whilst the Soviets employed grandmaster and psychologist Nikolai Krogius {{in the same}} role. The chief arbiter was Robert Wade.|$|E
25|$|Choosing <b>Wisely</b> is a United States-based health {{educational}} campaign, {{led by the}} American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM). It {{seeks to}} improve doctor–patient relationships and promote patient-centered care by informing patients and physicians about overutilization of medical resources.|$|E
25|$|Urtaku (674–664) {{for some}} time <b>wisely</b> {{maintained}} {{good relations with the}} Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (668–627), who sent wheat to Susiana during a famine. But these friendly relations were only temporary, and Urtaku was killed in battle during a failed Elamite attack on Assyria.|$|E
25|$|Uncle Hammer: The uncle of the Logan children. He {{does not}} like racism and cannot deal with it <b>wisely.</b> He has {{enough money to buy}} nice clothes and even an {{expensive}} car. He sells his car later in the book so the family could keep the land.|$|E
25|$|Captain Hoover <b>wisely</b> {{decided to}} save all the ships {{he could and}} decided not to stop to look for {{survivors}} - no one {{thought there would be}} any. Even if there were, the subs might still be around and more ships and men could be lost.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the state's {{relationship}} with cinema was also {{to change from}} the end of the '20s. The installed powers understood these young people dominated the cinema press and influenced the masses with their perspectives and <b>wisely</b> viewed the industry as a privileged means of propaganda for their new regime.|$|E
25|$|In religion, ethics, and philosophy, {{goodness}} and evil, or simply good and evil, {{is the concept}} of all human desires and behaviors as conforming to a dualistic spectrum—wherein in one direction are aspects that are <b>wisely</b> reverent of life and continuity ("good"), and in the other are aspects that are vainly reverent of death and destruction ("evil").|$|E
25|$|Others {{argue that}} {{the real reason for}} the claimed {{negative}} effects is lack of trust for elected officials to spend the public's money <b>wisely.</b> Business improvement districts are one means by which property owners have chosen to tax themselves for additional government services. Property owners find that these targeted levies are more palatable than general taxes.|$|E
25|$|During the 1969 Formula One season, Enzo Ferrari {{set about}} <b>wisely</b> {{spending}} his new-found wealth to revive his struggling team; though Ferrari did compete in Formula One in 1969, {{it was something}} of a throwaway season while the team was restructured. Amon continued to drive an older model and Pedro Rodríguez replaced Ickx; {{at the end of the}} year Amon left the team.|$|E
25|$|Let's Go Bowling is an American {{third wave}} ska band hailing from Fresno, California. Since the band's {{inception}} in 1986, the band's traditional ska style, barbershop harmonies, <b>wisely</b> crafted instrumentals, and its frantic live performances, helped {{set the standard}} for dress and culture for West Coast Ska, which in turn, set the groundwork for the Third Wave Movement in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The king forbade Laurentius to {{interfere}} with the reformation plans. Laurentius <b>wisely</b> defended the autonomy of the Church against the various ideas of Gustav, such as his wish to abolish all bishops, while still steady advancing and promoting the ideas of the reformation texts within Sweden. His main contribution were his abundant writings which laid the foundation for the Swedish Church Ordinance established at the Uppsala Council 1571.|$|E
25|$|To {{participate}} in Choosing <b>Wisely,</b> each society developed list of five tests, treatments, or services which that specialty commonly overuses. The society shares this information with their members, {{as well as}} organizations who can publicize to local community groups, and in each community patients and doctors can consider the information as they like. As of February 2013, there were 135 recommendations targeting a range of procedures to either question or to avoid without special consideration.|$|E
25|$|There is {{mounting}} {{evidence to show}} that a transition to a sustainable economy, if done <b>wisely,</b> may not harm economic growth significantly, in fact it could even help it. Recent research by ex-Wuppertal Institute member Joachim Spangenberg, working with neo-classical economists, shows that the transition, if focused on improving resource productivity, leads to higher economic growth than business as usual, {{while at the same time}} reducing pressures on the environment and enhancing employment.|$|E
25|$|As he {{got close}} enough, he {{suddenly}} made a leap and captured the king single-handedly, holding the king under his arm, meanwhile threatening {{to kill the}} king {{if there was any}} attempt of rescue. A little snap of the neck would cause fatality to the King, considering Pu Tong Seal's size, ferocity, and strength. The Burman soldiers <b>wisely</b> retreated at the command of Pu Tong Seal, because of fear of losing their beloved king.|$|E
25|$|During 1969 Enzo Ferrari {{set about}} <b>wisely</b> {{spending}} his new-found wealth to revive his struggling team; though Ferrari did compete in Formula One in 1969, {{it was something}} of a throwaway season while the team was restructured.

25|$|However, in 1940 the Soviets reorganized {{their forces}} and mauled {{the enemy in}} a final great offensive. Mannerheim, the Finnish commander, then advised his {{government}} to negotiate peace on Soviet terms. Recognizing that they had lost the war, the Finns <b>wisely</b> chose to settle early with the Soviets, while there was still potential for a relatively lenient peace treaty. In the end, the Finns retained their independence, but ceded huge tracts of territory, and resources, to the victorious Soviets.|$|E
25|$|On the {{rearmament}} question, Amery was consistent. He {{advocated a}} higher level of expenditure, but also a reappraisal of priorities through the creation of a top-level cabinet position to develop overall defence strategy so that the increased expenditures could be spent <b>wisely.</b> He thought that either he or Churchill should be given the post. When a ministry for the coordination of defence was finally created under a political lightweight, Sir Thomas Inskip, he regarded it as a joke.|$|E

25|$|Hoteliers Al Johnson and Robert Burns {{arrived in}} 1910, but <b>wisely</b> {{waited until the}} BC Express Company chose South Fort George as the {{location}} for their office and steamer landing. Once Johnson and Burns learned that the newly built and luxurious BX would be landing at South Fort George, they built the Hotel Northern and applied for and received a liquor license by December 1910. Unfortunately the first Hotel Northern wouldn't operate for very long and would burn down on July 1st, 1911.|$|E
25|$|When the War of 1812 began {{between the}} United States and Great Britain, Almeida participated as a {{privateer}} {{in the fight}} against the British. Acting <b>wisely,</b> he brought in 16 investors who bought his schooner Joseph & Mary, which weighed 139 tons, and only kept one share. The Joseph & Mary, under Captain William Westcott, was hit by friendly fire, and after capturing only two ships (the Piscataqua and a sloop) was captured on November 25, 1812, near Cuba by the British frigate HMS Narcissus.|$|E
25|$|While {{exploiting}} Slavic {{weakness in}} the wake of the Mongol invasion, Gediminas <b>wisely</b> avoided war with the Golden Horde, a great regional power at the time, while expanding Lithuania's border towards the Black Sea. He also secured an alliance with the nascent Grand Duchy of Moscow by marrying his daughter, Anastasia, to the grand duke Simeon. But he was strong enough to counterpoise the influence of Muscovy in northern Russia, and assisted the republic of Pskov, which acknowledged his overlordship, to break away from Great Novgorod.|$|E
