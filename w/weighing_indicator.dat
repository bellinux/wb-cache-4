40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyze the spatial {{distribution}} of soil compaction {{and the influence of}} soil water content on the resistance to penetration. The latter variable was described by the cone index. The soil at the study site was a Nitisol and the cone index data were obtained using a penetrometer. Soil resistance was assessed at 5 different depths, i. e. 0 - 10 cm, 10 - 20 cm, 20 - 30 cm, 30 - 40 cm and deeper than 40 cm, whereas soil water content was measured at 0 - 20 cm and 20 - 40 cm. Soil water conditions varied during the different samplings. Coefficients of variation for cone index ranged from 16. 5 % to 45. 8 % while those for soil water content varied from 8. 96 % to 21. 38 %. Results suggested a high correlation between soil resistance, as assessed by the cone index, and soil depth. However, the expected relation with soil water content was not observed. Spatial dependence was observed in 31 out of 35 data series, both cone index and soil water content. This structure was fitted to exponential models with nugget effect varying from 0 to 90 % of the sill value. Four of the data series showed a random behaviour. Inverse distance technique was used in order to map the distribution of the variables when no spatial structure was observed. Ordinary kriging showed a smoothing of the maps compared to those from inverse distance <b>weighing.</b> <b>Indicator</b> kriging was used to map the cone index spatial distribution for recommendation of further soil management...|$|E

40|$|The issue {{addressed}} in this paper is how to obtain a composite measure of several indicators using benchmarking principles.

The data used is labour market statistics for the Member States of the European Union. The proposed approach comes from a technique originally used in production theory, namely efficiency frontiers. Here, however, we benchmark not efficiency but performance. There are two main problems. First, related to composite measures, how does one compare (<b>weigh)</b> <b>indicators</b> that are not obviously comparable? Second, related to benchmarking, how does one benchmark countries that may differ considerably as regards the mix of the various indicators.

The objective and quantitative calculation {{of the importance of}} sustainable assessment indicators is a key problem in the accurate evaluation of SD. Traditional methods fail to quantify the coupling effects among indicators. This paper presents a weight determination approach based on the global sensitivity analysis algorithm known as the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST). This method is efficient and robust and is not only able to quantify the sensitivity of the evaluation indictors to the target, but can also quantitatively describe the uncertainties among the indictors. In this paper, we analyze the sensitivity of 18 indicators in a multi-index comprehensive evaluation model and <b>weigh</b> the <b>indicators</b> in the system according to their importance. To verify the feasibility and advantages of this new method, we compare the evaluation result with the traditional entropy method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical approach {{to assess the}} resilience of communities and states based on the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). The United Nations (UN) through their advancements in the Disaster Risk Reduction have released multiple international blueprints to help build the resilience of nations and communities, among which we mention the Hyogo Framework for Action and the Sendai Framework. The latter is still under development as the risk bases and the resilience indicators are yet to be defined. For this reason, the work presented here is built upon the more complete HFA framework. A number of weighted indicators taken from HFA are used to compute resilience. Those indicators, however, do not affect the resilience index equally. This discrepancy necessitates the need to <b>weigh</b> the <b>indicators</b> {{on the basis of}} their individual contribution towards resilience. In order to achieve this, we have used the Dependence Tree Analysis (DTA). This method allows identifying the dependencies between the HFA indicators and the resilience index and evaluate in unbiased way the weight factors of the different indicators. The paper is also proposing an analytic formulation to assess a new index, Bounce Back index (BBI), which combines both community's Exposure, Hazard, and Resilience together. To illustrate the methodology in full details, a case study composed of 37 countries is presented in this paper, where the Resilience and the Bounce Back indexes of each country are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical approach {{to evaluate the}} level of post-disaster adaptation (Bounce-Back) of communities based on their resilience. While resilience is the intrinsic characteristics of a system, adaptation considers external agents in its assessment. The presented work is to some extent a parallelism to the risk assessment concept. Generally, risk {{is a function of}} vulnerability, exposure, and hazard, whereas adaptation considers resilience instead of vulnerability in its estimation. This leads to the evaluation of a system's ability to cope with after-shock consequences and to return back to a functional state rather than the likelihood of a system to experience damage. The paper also proposes a quantitative framework for assessing resilience at the state level based on the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), a work done by the UN. HFA has succeeded in assessing the resilience of every state in a quantifiable fashion. HFA estimates the resilience of countries based on a number of indicators that are weighted equally. Those indicators, however, do not contribute equally to the resilience output; therefore, it is necessary to <b>weigh</b> those <b>indicators</b> according to their contribution towards resilience. To do so, we are introducing the Dependence Tree Analysis (DTA), which identifies the strength of relationships between the indicators and the resilience, giving weights to the indicators accordingly. A full case study composed of 37 countries is presented in this paper, where the resilience and the Bounce Back indices of each country are evaluated...|$|R

40|$|For {{stimulating}} {{sustainable development}} in developing countries, land use patterns {{and land use}} changes are considered critical, and therefore effective and efficient land use policies are needed. In this paper we present a methodological framework that has been developed in a joint European and developing countries project (LUPIS - Land Use Policies and Sustainable Development in Developing Countries), {{to assess the impact}} of land use policies on sustainable development in developing countries. An illustrative application is presented for a case study in China, where water pollution due to agriculture in Taihu Basin is a major problem. We argue that an integrated assessment is required, considering multiple drivers and indicators that determine the objectives and constraints of the stakeholders involved. Therefore, the sustainability impact assessment (SIA) is based on the concept of Land Use Functions (LUFs), and impacts on these LUFs are discussed with stakeholders based on a multi-criteria analysis. LUFs comprise economic, environmental and social indicators relevant for stakeholders at multiple scales. Instead of focusing only on the indicators that determine the problem (e. g., nutrient leaching in the Chinese case study), we take a broader perspective (considering also social, economic and institutional objectives and constraints), such that feasible policy options can be recommended. Stakeholders have a large role in discussing the selection of indicators and policies (pre-modelling), evaluating the impacts on indicators (modelling), and the <b>weighing</b> of <b>indicators</b> and LUFs (post-modelling).

40|$|Fossil {{resources}} are gradually depleting and becoming more expensive. Therefore, {{new ways to}} fuel our economy should be sought. Being a renewable carbon source, biomass will take {{a key role in}} the transition to a more sustainable economy. However, while potentially renewable, biomass relies on an intensive cultivation step and it will not be able to deliver a constant and endless supply without inducing other harmful effects. Therefore sustainability assessments of biorefineries are highly relevant. After an introductory first chapter, the sustainability concept and assessment methodologies are studied in chapter two. Based on this information, the life cycle framework is applied in chapter three, in which it is shown that a food and feed company processing wheat can switch to a fossil fuel replacing biorefinery without inducing efficiency losses. On the other hand, the replacement of fossil fuels goes at the cost of other resources such as land, water, minerals, etc. A profound study of the supply chain of different sources of biomass illustrates that the valorization of domestic organic waste and farm residues is an environmentally benign opportunity. These types of biomass however, have lower conversion efficiencies compared to agricultural crops such as silage maize because they often contain more difficult molecules to process such as lignocelluloses requiring more pre- and post-treatment. It is demonstrated that these different types of organic resources can be efficiently converted to a highly energetic biomethane by anaerobic digestion while maintaining nutrients in the digestate, which can be used as fertilizer. Additional emissions causing acidification and eutrophication should however be avoided by good agricultural management. The fourth chapter of this dissertation focuses on methodological development. The quantification of sustainability is a complex task and therefore more research is required to improve assessment techniques. A first identified bottleneck is the acquirement of reliable data. While this is the key to obtain useful results from a life cycle study, it is especially difficult to gather mass and energy balances of future production processes. For this purpose, engineering modules are developed of 22 processes that are commonly used in industry which can be used in prospective sustainability assessments. Although challenges are identified, an application in a case study illustrated the operability and reliability of the approach. The second part of this chapter focuses on the allocation procedure of LCA. It is illustrated that this methodological attribute should be linked to the goal and scope of the assessment. System expansion can give interesting insights in economy wide assessments to assess different product mixes and markets, whereas partitioning is a useful approach in product policies and supply chain improvement. For the latter, exergy is identified as a useful parameter to quantify the physical value of both mass and energy. In a last part of the methodological chapter, an indicator of sustainable development is proposed that focuses on the broader concept of sustainable development. The <b>indicator</b> <b>weighs</b> the antropospheric benefit, quantified as satisfaction by a product or service and the labor quality and quantity, with the ecological burden, quantified as resource and emission impact. These factors are weighted with macro-scale aspects such as the human development index, unemployment rate and the world’s ecological footprint. Overall, it can be concluded that society will have to take better care of its available resources. Biorefineries can have a role in this development by optimally utilizing the available biomass. However, a strong policy is needed that analyzes supply and demand interactions and related impacts such as land use, water use and field emissions. Life cycle assessment will take an essential role in these developments, both in a top-down perspective by analyzing direct and indirect effects of product mixes and markets, as in a bottom-up approach by analyzing and optimizing production chains. On the other hand, more collaborative research is required to better understand different aspects of sustainable development and to search for better ways for a proper assessment of different scopes and scales...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionDevelopment is {{a multidimensional}} and complex process that involves making changes in social attitudes and national institutions {{as well as}} accelerating the economic growth, reducing inequalities and eradicating poverty. Housing is considered {{as an integral part}} of development in a society. With its large economic, social, cultural, environmental, and physical dimensions, this sector plays a pivotal role in presenting the characteristics and improving the appearance of the society in general. Identifying and assessing the housing condition in a country depends on the detection and analysis of the factors affecting housing, which can be considered as guidelines for the resource allocation in future planning and for promoting justice and sustainable development. Isfahan city, with a population of over one million people, is the third most populous city in the country and has fourteen districts. This research can help policymakers and planners alleviate the poverty, promote the social justice and formulate appropriate policies by looking into the indicators of the housing sector in the fourteen districts of Isfahan and their ranking using analytic network process. 2 - Theoretical BasesHousing is an extremely complex and extensive issue with different spatial, architectural, physical, economic, social, financial, psychological and medical aspects. As such, in this study various definitions have been proposed that, for example, deal with housing as a physical location and as a shelter, considering it as one of the basic needs of the households. In addition to the physical location, the housing includes the entire residential environment, which has various dimensions and goes beyond the physical shelter. Housing is the first unit of society and the most important unit of human settlements that represents the smallest unit of the planning. Most governments, in response to the importance of housing, incorporate the housing planning in national, regional and urban planning. The analysis of the housing indicators is one of the techniques that can help identify effective procedures in the field of housing. The indicators of the housing sector are the key to housing planning. The scope, complexity and diversity of housing indicators and their role in housing planning necessitate the classification of these indicators based on their role and performance. Housing indicators not only describe the current state of the housing in different aspects, but also they can be used to rank different districts and provide a clear picture of the housing in the past, present and future, leading to adoption of appropriate policies and strategies in the future. 3 -DiscussionIndicators for the assessment of housing development in districts of Isfahan were determined based on a review of the literature on housing indicators and available data. These indicators were classified in three categories, i. e., economic, social and physical. The economic indicators included the extent of the state funds allocated to the housing sector, the rate of employment generated by the housing sector, the annual production capacity of housing for 1000 population, the share of different stakeholders (state and housing cooperative) in housing construction and land prices. Social indicators include the availability of housing, the (annual) household growth rate, the need for housing (deficiency), the household density in residential units, the population density in residential units, psychological well-being (including the average per capita housing and the average area of the residential units), the housing quality in terms of access to water and electricity utilities, welfare services, etc., the average building life, durable construction and renovation of old texture. The physical indicators include the average building density, the average occupation density, residential density, the average area of building, per capita building, appearance and building materials (the ratio of housing units with resistant materials to the total housing), the ratio of malformed residential units to the total housing and the relative share of old texture. It should be noted that the data associated with each of the above parameters were gathered separately for each area to be used in model process. In order to implement the analytic network process (ANP) model, we need to design a proper network model that includes the objective of the study as well as the main and sub-criteria (index) to perfectly address the research objective. In this model, the interdependence of the criteria and sub-criteria as well as the binary matrices in the model were analyzed using the ideas of experts to determine the final value of each indicator. Options (fourteen Isfahan districts) were also examined separately in the model and after final <b>weighing,</b> the <b>indicators</b> were proposed in terms of evaluation matrix. 4 -ConclusionThe main criteria as well as sub-criteria considered in this study are both interdependent and interrelated. Moreover, in cases where the interrelation of the indicators is an issue, the analytic hierarchy does not include such relationship and may thus lead to the misleading results. In such cases, the analytical network can be used as an alternative. The application of analytical network process even in presence of interrelated indicators does not interfere with the model. Thus, given the interrelation of the indicators in housing sector, analytic network process can be utilized. According to the results of research on the final evaluation of indicators, the housing quality indicators in terms of access to sociocultural services, land price and the annual production capacity of housing for every 1000 people were the most important indicators of housing development in urban areas. Furthermore, the results of study on districts ranking based on the housing development suggest that District 1 ranked first by gaining the highest score (0. 574) and Districts 6 and 5 rank second and third respectively among the urban districts of Isfahan. On the other hand, District 14 in the far north of Isfahan gained the lowest score (- 0. 719), ranking as the most deprived district of Isfahan. 5 - RecommendationsIn order to assess the urban development of Isfahan districts in the housing sector, after the compilation, analysis and assessment of the most important indicators and considering the nature of the housing development the assessment of which requires a variety of quantitative and qualitative indicators, and given the various roles and functions of these parameters in this study, a combination of ANP and Delphi methods were used as a technique for comparing these indicators. Then, drawing on the ideas of experts and professionals, the <b>indicators</b> were <b>weighed.</b> After determining the final value of each index using analytical network model, the assessment matrix was created to determine the extent of development of each district in terms of housing. The district with lower development scores fell into the lowest ranks, namely the deprived and highly deprived groups (Districts 7 and 14). These areas need to take priority in poverty alleviation plans and the construction funds in coordinated policies should be allocated in fitting with the needs and requirements of such districts. It is because they have a larger number of negative indicators that need to be address properly. Detailed case studies and special plans such as organizing projects, development-oriented plans and specific economic plans aimed at alleviating poverty are among the strategies that can be proposed for these districts. The districts with higher development scores, however, need to take lower priority in terms of funds allocation, and maintaining the status quo should serve as a model for future planning. Further comprehensive studies still need to be carried out in the areas surveyed in this study with the aim of improving the structure, current state and housing quality in near future.
