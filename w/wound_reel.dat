6000|$|He {{was even}} an anxious father; {{perhaps that is}} the part where {{optimism}} is hardest tested. He was eager for his sons; eager for their health, whether of mind or body; eager for their education; in that, I should have thought, too eager. But he kept a pleasant face upon all things, believed in play, loved it himself, shared boyishly in theirs, and knew how to put a face of entertainment upon business and a spirit of education into entertainment. If he was to test {{the progress of the}} three boys, this advertisement would appear in their little manuscript paper:- 'Notice: The Professor of Engineering in the University of Edinburgh intends {{at the close of the}} scholastic year to hold examinations in the following subjects: (1) For boys in the fourth class of the Academy - Geometry and Algebra; (2) For boys at Mr. Henderson's school - Dictation and Recitation; (3) For boys taught exclusively by their mothers - Arithmetic and Reading.' Prizes were given; but what prize would be so conciliatory as this boyish little joke? It may read thin here; it would smack racily in the playroom. [...] Whenever his sons 'started a new fad' (as one of them writes to me) they 'had only to tell him about it, and he was at once interested and keen to help.' He would discourage them in nothing unless it was hopelessly too hard for them; only, if there was any principle of science involved, they must understand the principle; and whatever was attempted, that was to be done thoroughly. If it was but play, if it was but a puppetshow they were to build, he set them the example of being no sluggard in play. When Frewen, the second son, embarked on the ambitious design to make an engine for a toy steamboat, Fleeming made him begin with a proper drawing - doubtless to the disgust of the young engineer; but once that foundation laid, helped in the work with unflagging gusto, 'tinkering away,' for hours, and assisted at the final trial 'in the big bath' with no less excitement than the boy. 'He would take any amount of trouble to help us,' writes my correspondent. 'We never felt an affair was complete till we had called him to see, and he would come at any time, in the middle of any work.' There was indeed one recognised playhour, immediately after the despatch of the day's letters; and the boys were to be seen waiting on the stairs until the mail should be ready and the fun could begin. But at no other time did this busy man suffer his work to interfere with that first duty to his children; and there is a pleasant tale of the inventive Master Frewen, engaged at the time upon a toy crane, bringing to the study where his father sat at work a half- <b>wound</b> <b>reel</b> that formed some part of his design, and observing, 'Papa, you might finiss windin' this for me; I am so very busy to- day.' ...|$|E
50|$|An unusually {{configured}} {{magnetic field}} was created when Dillon {{was struck by}} lightning while holding live, high-tension wires and a <b>wound</b> <b>reel</b> of one-inch cable, granting him superhuman powers. Electro can generate massive quantities of electricity, theoretically up to approximately one million volts.

5000|$|Within {{a couple}} of years Scientific American took notice, and printed the {{following}} praise for Whitehill's design, especially for its powertrain: Of Vibrating ShuttlesThese are shuttles of the long description, moving in a segment of a circle. There are several varieties. The most novel machine of this kind is the vibrating shuttle machine just produced by the Singer Manufacturing Company. In this case the shuttle itself consists of a steel tube, into the open end of which the <b>wound</b> <b>reel</b> is dropped, and is free to revolve quite loosely. Variation of tension is thus obviated in a very simple manner. The chief point of interest in the machine is undoubtedly the means employed in transferring the motion from the main shaft to the underneath parts, an arrangement as ingenious and effective as any device ever introduced into stitching mechanism. It is the invention of Mr. Robert Whitehall sic, and consists of a vertical rocking shaft situated in the arm of the machine. Motion is imparted to it by means of an elbow formed upon the main shaft acting upon two arms, called wipers, projecting from the rocking shaft, the angle formed by the arms exactly coinciding with that of the elbow in its revolution.This admirable motion will no doubt attract much attention from mechanists and engineers.|$|E

50|$|This format used helical scan on a 1/2 inch tape. Three {{different}} {{capacities of}} tape cartridge were offered: 10, 25 and 50 GB, differing {{only in the}} length of tape <b>wound</b> on the <b>reels</b> and in the external media identification character, A, B or C, {{which was designed to}} be read by the Powderhorn automated library's bar-code reader system.|$|R
50|$|The {{tension of}} the yarn as it was <b>wound</b> onto the <b>reel</b> was {{important}} {{because it would be}} elastic and so a standard tension was required to ensure uniformity. For a given reel, this would be determined by the friction of the setup and so the test hanks would be made and measured in other ways to calibrate the device.|$|R
50|$|With {{material}} such as {{photographic film}} that is flat and long but is relatively wide, the material generally {{is stored in}} successive single layers. In cases where the material is more uniform in cross-section (for example, a cable), the material may be safely <b>wound</b> around a <b>reel</b> that is wider than its width. In this case, several windings are needed to create a layer on the reel.|$|R

5000|$|All {{electrical}} cables {{are somewhat}} flexible, {{allowing them to}} be shipped to installation sites <b>wound</b> on <b>reels</b> or drums. Where applications require a cable to be moved repeatedly, such as for portable equipment, more flexible cables called [...] "cords" [...] or [...] "flex" [...] are used. Flexible cords contain fine stranded conductors, not solid core conductors, and have insulation and sheaths to withstand the forces of repeated flexing and abrasion. Heavy duty flexible power cords such as those feeding a mine face cutting machine are carefully engineered â€” their life is measured in weeks. Very flexible power cables are used in automated machinery, robotics, and machine tools. See power cord and extension cable for further description of flexible power cables. Other types of flexible cable include twisted pair, extensible, coaxial, shielded, and communication cable.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 729 Magnetic Tape Unit was IBM's iconic tape {{mass storage}} {{system from the}} late 1950s through the mid-1960s. Part of the IBM 7 track family of tape units, it was used on late 700, most 7000 and many 1400 series computers. Like its predecessor, the IBM 727 and many successors, the 729 used 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) {{magnetic}} tape up to 2400 feet (730 m) long <b>wound</b> on <b>reels</b> up to 10Â½ inch (267 mm) diameter. To allow rapid tape acceleration (and thus reduced seek/access times), long vacuum columns were placed between the tape reels and the read/write heads to absorb sudden increases in tape tension which would otherwise break the tape. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring {{in the back of}} the tape reel.|$|R

50|$|An {{audio tape}} recorder, tape deck or tape machine is an analog audio storage device that records and plays back sounds, {{including}} articulated voices, usually using magnetic tape, either <b>wound</b> on a <b>reel</b> or in a cassette, for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal {{by moving the}} tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape {{in proportion to the}} audio signal. Tape-recording devices include reel-to-reel tape deck and the cassette deck.|$|R
50|$|Where {{components}} {{are to be}} placed, the printed circuit board normally has flat, usually tin-lead, silver, or gold plated copper pads without holes, called solder pads. Solder paste, a sticky mixture of flux and tiny solder particles, is first applied to all the solder pads with a stainless steel or nickel stencil using a screen printing process. It can also be applied by a jet-printing mechanism, similar to an inkjet printer. After pasting, the boards then proceed to the pick-and-place machines, where they are placed on a conveyor belt. The components {{to be placed on}} the boards are usually delivered to the production line in either paper/plastic tapes <b>wound</b> on <b>reels</b> or plastic tubes. Some large integrated circuits are delivered in static-free trays. Numerical control pick-and-place machines remove the parts from the tapes, tubes or trays and place them on the PCB.|$|R
50|$|In amateur processing, {{the film}} {{is removed from the}} camera and <b>wound</b> onto a <b>reel</b> in {{complete}} darkness (usually inside a darkroom with the safelight turned off or a lightproof bag with arm holes). The reel holds the film in a spiral shape, with space between each successive loop so the chemicals may flow freely across the film's surfaces. The reel is placed in a specially designed light-proof tank (called daylight processing tank or a light-trap tank) where it is retained until final washing is complete.|$|R

It printed the data on 0.75 in wide paper tape <b>wound</b> on large <b>reels.</b> The sound it made while printing earned it the name [...] "stock ticker". Other inventors improved on this device, and ultimately Thomas Edison patented a [...] "universal stock ticker", selling over 5,000 in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Real Zari is {{made from}} fine silver or gold thread is drawn from silver or gold alloys, which is {{flattened}} by passing it under through equal pressure rotating rollers. The flattened silver threads are wound on the base yarn that is usually made of silk. These spools with silk and silver threads are further flattened for electroplating. The threads are then plated with gold {{by the process of}} electroplating. The lustre of the gilded threads is further increased by passing them through a brightener. These threads are then <b>wound</b> on a <b>reel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} unusual {{peripherals}} produced for the PDP-10 was the DECtape.

40|$|A braking {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for a tape transport device having two stacked coaxial reels and feelers mounted in {{proximity to the}} reels for sensing the tape being <b>wound</b> on each <b>reel.</b> A device is mounted in proximity to adjacent central hubs of the reels to a simultaneously, frictionally engage both hubs and brake both reels. A mechanical actuator is coupled to both feelers and to the brake device.

50|$|Carbon fiber is {{frequently}} supplied {{in the form}} of a continuous tow <b>wound</b> onto a <b>reel.</b> The tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating, or size, such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The tow can be conveniently unwound from the reel for use. Each carbon filament in the tow is a continuous cylinder with a diameter of 5-10 micrometers and consists almost exclusively of carbon. The earliest generation (e.g. T300, HTA and AS4) had diameters of 16-22 micrometers. Later fibers (e.g. IM6 or IM600) have diameters that are approximately 5 micrometers.|$|R

60|$|Despite my intense excitement, I {{was calm}} enough to follow directions. But when I struck I felt no weight at all--no {{strain on the}} line. Frantically I wound and jerked--again and again! I never felt him at all. Suddenly my line rose--and then, bewilderingly near the boat, when I was looking far off, the water split with a roar and out shot a huge, gleaming, white-and-purple fish. He blurred in my sight. Down he went with a crash. I <b>wound</b> the <b>reel</b> like a madman, but I never even half got up the slack line. The {{swordfish}} had run straight toward the boat. He leaped again, in a place I did not expect, and going down, instantly came up in another direction. His speed, his savageness, stunned me. I could not judge of his strength, for I never felt his weight. The next leap I saw him sling the hook. It was a great performance. Then that swordfish, finding himself free, leaped for the open sea, and every few yards he {{came out in a}} clean jump. I watched him, too fascinated to count the times he broke water, but he kept it up till he was out of sight on the horizon.|$|R
60|$|At last an {{extremely}} simple and remarkably successful deep-sea sounding apparatus {{was invented by}} Mr Brooke, an American officer. It consisted of nothing more than thin twine for a sounding-line, and a cannon ball for a sinker. The twine was made for the purpose, fine but very strong, and was <b>wound</b> on a <b>reel</b> {{to the extent of}} ten thousand fathoms. The cannon ball, which was from thirty-two to sixty-eight pounds' weight, had a hole quite through it, into which was fixed a sliding rod, the end of which, covered with grease, projected several inches beyond the ball. By an ingenious and simple contrivance, the cannon ball was detached when it reached the bottom of the sea, and the light rod was drawn up with specimens of the bottom adhering to the grease.|$|R

The method and apparatus {{are based on the}} principle that, at a relatively large radius, the loci of layers of a thin web <b>wound</b> on the <b>reel</b> approximate a family of concentric circles having radii respectively successively increasing by a length equal to the web thickness. Tachometer pulses are generated in response to linear movement of the web and reset pulses are generated in response to rotation of the reel. A digital circuit, responsive to the tachometer and reset pulses, generates data indicative of the layer number of any layer of the web and of position of the web within the layer without requiring numerical interpolation...|$|R
50|$|IBM {{computers}} {{from the}} 1950s used ferrous-oxide coated tape {{similar to that}} used in audio recording. IBM's technology soon became the de facto industry standard. Magnetic tape dimensions were 0.5 in wide and <b>wound</b> on removable <b>reels</b> up to 10.5 in in diameter. Different tape lengths were available with 1200 ft and 2400 ft on mil and one half thickness being somewhat standard. During the 1980s, longer tape lengths such as 3600 ft became available using a much thinner PET film. Most tape drives could support a maximum reel size of 10.5 in. CDC used IBM compatible 1/2 inch magnetic tapes, but also offered a 1 inch wide variant, with 14 tracks (12 data tracks corresponding to the 12 bit word of CDC 6000 series peripheral processors, plus two parity bits) in the CDC 626 drive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} of the head at program switch point could sometimes pull the tape up or down, causing the tape to fold over and start playing {{the back side of}} the tape. The tape would continue to play, albeit muffled and barely audible. Continued playing would flip the entire tape over, so the tape would be <b>wound</b> on the <b>reel</b> inside with the backside showing. Many vintage tapes can be found with {{the back side of the}} tape, facing forward. The program switch point is often the place where the tapes would be ingested into the player i.e. [...] "eaten", when the tape head moved from program 4, to program 1- its furthest track change movement. While moving upward the head would grab the tape, fold it over, and when this fold hit the capstan, it would wrap around the capstan and ingest the tape into the player.|$|R
50|$|Tape {{formulation}} {{affects the}} retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, print-through, optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types (ferric oxide Fe2O3, chromium dioxide CrO2, etc.) {{and also in the}} precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the tensile strength and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape <b>wound</b> on a <b>reel</b> picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended pre- and post-echoes on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{robotic system}} for scientific exploration of rough terrain {{would include a}} stationary or infrequently moving larger base robot, to which would be tethered a smaller hopping robot of the type described in the immediately preceding article. The two-robot design would extend {{the reach of the}} base robot, making it possible to explore nearby locations that might otherwise be inaccessible or too hazardous for the base robot. The system would include a launching mechanism and a motor-driven reel on the larger robot. The outer end of the tether would be attached to the smaller robot; the inner end of the tether would be attached to the reel. The figure depicts the launching and retrieval process. The launching mechanism would aim and throw the smaller robot toward a target location, and the tether would be paid out from the reel as the hopping robot flew toward the target. Upon completion of exploratory activity at the target location, the smaller robot would be made to hop and, in a coordinated motion, the tether would be <b>wound</b> onto the <b>reel</b> to pull the smaller robot back to the larger one...|$|R
50|$|The divers of {{the group}} are {{informed}} of the intention to ascend, using the thumb up hand signal, and if not already neutrally buoyant, will adjust their buoyancy, and hold the inflator mechanism ready to dump excess gas from the BCD as it expands during the ascent. Increased buoyancy of the BCD and dive suit due to gas expansion could cause a runaway ascent so air is vented as the divers ascend to retain approximately neutral buoyancy. The divers frequently look upwards while ascending to avoid any obstacles. A competent diver will ascend {{with little or no}} need to fin upwards, and can stop and achieve neutral buoyancy at any depth. The diver handling the buoy may choose to remain slightly negative during the ascent to keep a small amount of tension on the line as it is <b>wound</b> onto the <b>reel</b> or spool. Ascent speed is limited to the requirement of the decompression schedule in use - (commonly kept below 10 meters per minute) so that dissolved inert gases can be eliminated safely. A dive computer may be used to help judge this speed.|$|R
