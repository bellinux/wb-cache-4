5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States.

I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon.

People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
