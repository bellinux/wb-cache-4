5000|$|Literally, [...] "trama" [...] is the Latin {{word for}} the [...] "weft" [...] or [...] "woof" [...] yarns in the weaving of cloth. This {{probably}} {{is related to the}} basidiocarp trama being [...] "filler" [...] tissue and that analogously the <b>woof</b> <b>yarn</b> in weaving is sometimes called [...] "fill". Furthermore, the trama tends to be soft tissue, and in weaving, the <b>woof</b> <b>yarn</b> is not tightly stretched; it therefore need not as a rule be as strong as the warp yarn.|$|E

There {{is no need for}} layering to create a part, because a single fabric provides the full three-dimensional reinforcement. The 3-D woven fabric is a variant of the 2D weaving process, and itâ€™s an extension of the very old technique of creating double and triple woven cloth. 3D weaving allows the production of fabrics up to 10 cm in thickness.Fibers placed in the thickness direction are called z-yarn, warp weaver, or binder yarn for 3D woven fabrics. More than one layer of fabric is woven at the same time, and z-yarn interlaces warp and <b>woof</b> <b>yarns</b> of different layers during the process. At the end of the weaving process, an integrated 3D woven structure, which has a considerable thickness, is produced. Three-dimensional woven structures can create composite materials with fiber volume fractions around 50% in both 3D unit cell and 3D orthogonal structures.|$|R
