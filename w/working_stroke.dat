As the boiler is under pressure during operation, feedwater must be forced into the boiler at a pressure that {{is greater than the}} steam pressure, necessitating the use of some sort of pump. Early engines used pumps driven by the motion of the pistons (axle pumps), which were simple to operate and reliable, but only operated when the locomotive was moving, and could overload the valve gear and piston rods at high speeds. Steam injectors later replaced the pump, while some engines transitioned to turbopumps. Standard practice evolved to use two independent systems for feeding water to the boiler; either two steam injectors or, on more conservative designs, axle pumps when running at service speed and a steam injector for filling the boiler when stationary or at low speeds. By the 20th century virtually all new-built locomotives used only steam injectors – often one injector was supplied with [...] "live" [...] steam straight from the boiler itself and the other used exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders, which was more efficient (since it made use of otherwise wasted steam) but could only be used when the locomotive was in motion and the regulator was open.|$|E

This offset distance {{is referred to}} as L1 and is the fixed distance between the crank arm pivot point and the slider axis. This offset distance means that the slider-crank motion is no longer symmetrical about the sliding axis. In addition, the required crank angles of the forward and reverse strokes are no longer equivalent. An offset slider-crank provides a quick return when a slower <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> is desired.|$|E

Crystal structures of myosin II indicate an unloaded <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> of 10 – 12 nm, a range confirmed by recent x-ray interference experiments. However, when an actin filament, held between two weakly, optically trapped beads {{is made to}} interact with a single head of skeletal myosin, the bead displacements have often been reported as having a mean value of 5 – 6 nm, a value that is commonly interpreted as the <b>working</b> <b>stroke.</b> In general, the observed displacement {{is not expected to}} be equal to the <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> because the kinetics of the stroke is necessarily strain-dependent: this effect biases the frequency of binding events to different actin sites so that displacements smaller than the <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> are preferentially selected. Our analysis is tailored to current trap experiments, in which the time resolution is insufficient to detect prerigor states. If the preceding transitions are in equilibrium, the mean displacement is zero, contrary to observations in the presence of ATP.

Addressing the question at the single-molecule level with optical tweezers allows the problem to be resolved. We have compared the <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> on the binding of four myosin complexes (myosin, myosin-ADP, myosin-pyrophosphate, and myosin-adenyl- 5 ′yl imidodiphosphate) with that observed while hydrolyzing ATP. None of the four was observed to give a <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> significantly different from zero. A <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> (5. 4 nm) was observed only with ATP, which indicates that the other states bind to actin in a rigor-like conformation and that myosin products (M. ADP.

40|$|AbstractThe strain-dependent {{kinetics}} of the myosin <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> {{under load}} {{is derived from}} a flat-energy-landscape model for its untethered lever-arm, and compared with other scenarios in the literature. The “flat landscape” scenario is compatible with muscle-fiber experiments, but is more critically relevant to single-myosin experiments with an optically trapped actin filament. In such experiments, the strain dependence of stroke kinetics may be explored by comparing event-averaged and time-averaged displacements of the filament. With a specific kinetic model of the cross-bridge cycle, we have previously shown that the event-averaged displacement underestimates the <b>working</b> <b>stroke.</b> Here we predict that the two kinds of averaging give diverging estimates of the <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> as the resolving time of the event detector is decreased to 1 ms or less, the discrepancy being critically dependent on the strain dependence of the stroke rate.

40|$|Myosin II is {{the motor}} protein that {{produces}} force and shortening in muscle by ATP-driven cyclic interactions of its globular portion, the head, with the actin filament. During each interaction the myosin head undergoes a conformational change, the <b>working</b> <b>stroke,</b> which, {{depending on the}} mechanical conditions, can generate a force of several piconewtons or an axial displacement of the actin filament toward {{the centre of the}} sarcomere of several nanometres. However, the sizes of the elementary force and length steps and their dependence on the mechanical conditions are still under question. Due to the small fraction of the ATPase cycle time myosin II spends attached to actin, single molecule mechanics failed to produce definitive measurements of the individual events. In intact frog muscle fibres, however, myosin II's <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> can be synchronised in the few milliseconds following a step reduction in either force or length superimposed on the isometric contraction.

We sought to determine whether insurance status {{is associated}} with utilization and intensity of institutional postacute care among <b>working</b> age <b>stroke</b> survivors. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study of ischemic stroke survivors under age 65 from the 2004 – 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was conducted. Hierarchical logistic regression models controlling for patient and hospital-level factors were used. The primary outcome was utilization of any institutional postacute care (inpatient rehabilitation or skilled nursing facilities) following hospital admission for ischemic stroke. Intensity of rehabilitation was explored by com-paring utilization of inpatient rehabilitation facilities and skilled nursing facilities. Results: Of the 33, 917 <b>working</b> age <b>stroke</b> survivors, 19. 3 % were uninsured, 19. 8 % were Med-icaid enrollees, and 22. 8 % were discharged to institutional postacute care. Compared to those privately insured, uninsured stroke survivors were less likely (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0. 53, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 47 – 0. 59) while stroke survivors with Medicaid {{were more likely to}} utilize any institutional postacute care (AOR 1. 40, 95 % CI 1. 27 – 1. 54).

Using an optical tweezers-based force transducer we found that expressed myosin VI is nonprocessive and produces a large <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> of 18 nm.

40|$|Muscle {{contraction}} {{is due to}} myosin motors that transiently attach {{with their}} globular head to an actin filament and generate force. After a sudden reduction of the load below the maximum isometric force (T 0), the attached myosin heads execute an axial movement (the <b>working</b> <b>stroke)</b> that drives the sliding of the actin filament {{toward the center of}} the sarcomere by an amount that is larger at lower load and is 11 nm near zero load. Here, we show that an increase in temperature from 2 to 17 °C, which increases the average isometric force per attached myosin head by 60 %, does not affect the amount of filament sliding promoted by a reduction in force from T 0 to 0. 7 T 0, whereas it reduces the sliding under low load by 2. 5 nm. These results exclude the possibility that the myosin <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> is due to the release of the mechanical energy stored in the initial endothermic force-generating process and show that, at higher temperatures, the <b>working</b> <b>stroke</b> energy is greater because of higher force, although the stroke length is smaller at low load.
