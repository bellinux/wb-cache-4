5|$|One {{approach}} to formulating M-theory and studying its properties {{is provided by}} the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical result <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that M-theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string and M-theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E

5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E

30|$|The {{children}} {{in the two groups}} were asked whether they travelled by school bus to and from school and whether they carried a mobile phone. The children could respond “almost always” (<b>which</b> <b>implied</b> 3 – 5 times per week), “often” (<b>which</b> <b>implied</b> 1 – 2 times per week), “seldom” (<b>which</b> <b>implied</b> not every week), or “almost never” (<b>which</b> <b>implied</b> 0 – 2 times per month). In the analyses “almost always” and “often” were collapsed and so were “seldom” and “almost never”. Going to school by school bus was more common (“almost always + often”) in the Con group (78  %) compared with the CWD (43  %), p[*]=[*]. 039, whereas {{there was no difference in}} going by school bus from school. Whilst all CWD had mobile phones, this was not the case in the Con group (57  %, p[*]=[*]. 003).|$|R
5|$|The Langenberg Quarry, where K. langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant Massifs. During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this does not imply that K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg Quarry were probably transported allochthonously (albeit only by a short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the quarry, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Theobald of Bec to the Archbishopric of Canterbury was {{announced at the}} Council of Westminster in 1138. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury writes that 17bishops attended the council, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that Alexander was present. After a failed expedition to Normandy in 1137, the influence of Alexander's uncle, Roger of Salisbury, waned at the court of King Stephen, but the king took no action against the family that might incite them to rebel. In early 1139 Stephen may have named William d'Aubigny as Earl of Lincoln, perhaps {{in an effort to}} limit Alexander's influence in Lincolnshire.|$|E

5|$|Wells {{was listed}} in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Welle, from the Old English wiells, not as a town but as four manors with a {{population}} of 132, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> a population of 500–600. Earlier names for the settlement have been identified which include Fontanetum, in a charter of 725 granted by King Ina to Glastonbury and Fontanensis Ecclesia. Tidesput or Tithesput furlang relates to the area east of the bishops garden in 1245. Wells was part of, and gave its name to, the hundred of Wells Forum.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E
5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, <b>which</b> <b>implies</b> a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.
