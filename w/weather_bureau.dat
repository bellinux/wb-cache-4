5|$|On July 1, 1879 the Army Signal Service {{began taking}} weather {{observations}} using weather equipment at the Springer Building in Springfield {{becoming the first}} federal weather station in the region. Eleven years later the U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> was founded and the equipment in Springfield was transferred from the Signal Service to the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau.</b> In 1898 Springfield became {{the site of a}} new weather station that used kites to measure data in the atmosphere using tethered instruments. In 1905 Peoria became the site of a new U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau,</b> constructed at the cost of $7,969 the station measured temperatures, wind speeds, precipitation, snowfall, and barometric pressure. A year later at the Peoria Station a telegraph was installed to help better transmit weather data and observations. In Springfield the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> was officially moved from its original location to a new building at 7th and Monroe. In 1928 the Springfield <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> moved temporarily to the Abe Lincoln Hotel and the old office was subsequently destroyed for construction of a new federal courthouse. Finally in 1930 the Springfield office was moved to its new location at the Springfield federal building.|$|E
5|$|A U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> Airport Station was {{established}} at the downtown Boise Airport, now the campus of Boise State University, on May 11, 1933 which is only about a 1-mile south of the U.S. Federal Building. Weather observations {{had been taken from}} the airport by the Bureau of Air Commerce personal since October 18, 1931. From July 1, 1939 to December 18, 1939, while the U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> office was moved to the airport at Gowen Field, official weather observations and one PIBAL flight a day were taken at the old airport.|$|E
5|$|On July21, {{a vessel}} named Cape Horn relayed {{information}} regarding the storm to the National <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau,</b> leading to them re-issuing advisories on the storm, upgrading it to a hurricane. The following day, a reconnaissance mission from Oahu, Hawaii located the storm's 40mi (65km) wide eye and recorded sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts up to 115mph (185km/h). Shortly after, the storm likely attained its peak intensity as a high-end Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Early on July23, warning responsibility of the storm {{was given to the}} National <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> in Honolulu, Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|The National Hurricane Research Laboratory (NHRL) {{was formed}} in December 1964 out of the National Hurricane Research Project, the U. S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> effort to scientifically examine {{tropical}} cyclones {{in order to make}} better predictions. Laboratory status signified that this effort was now a permanent part of the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> activities.|$|R

50|$|Also in the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau’s</b> top-10 {{list for}} Oregon are the snowstorms of January 1950. Newport saw {{a total of}} about 6 in fall during the month, four times its normal annual snowfall.|$|R
5|$|On {{the day of}} the hurricane's closest {{approach}} to the United States, the National <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> issued storm warnings from Cape May, New Jersey, to Eastport, Maine.|$|E
5|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), {{was created}} in 1965 {{as a way for}} the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> to work together, reduce the {{duplication}} of services, and coordinate national fire planning and operations. The U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> office was moved to {{the second floor of the}} old administration building on June 5, 1969. The U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> made the Boise office its “hub of fire weather activities” in the west where fire weather specialists are able to make face to face contact with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management fire dispatchers. U.S. Congress approved the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) requested for $316,000 in additional funds in the fiscal year 1970 budget in July 1969 for the Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and for bringing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma up to full Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) status. On June 22, 1970, the Boise Forecast Office began issuing official weather forecasts for Idaho south of the Salmon River. The U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> changed their name to the National Weather Service on October 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> {{first began}} cautioning areas of Central America at 1600UTC on September26, advising people {{in areas of}} {{northeast}} Nicaragua and Honduras to take precautionary measures, along with all vessels and small craft in the Gulf of Honduras south to Cabo Gracias a Dios. After Janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest, advisories warned areas in British Honduras and Quintana Roo of hurricane-related impacts. Though no official warnings were issued for areas of Central America, advisories published by the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> cautioned interests in the hurricane's path up until landfall. Evacuations took place in several coastal towns in Quintana Roo upon notification of the oncoming storm. People were evacuated to inland hillside shelters. After the hurricane moved through the Yucatán Peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> alerted areas in the storm's path {{on the western side}} of Mexico's Gulf Coast. At the time, Janet was expected to make landfall between Veracruz and Tuxpan. Areas were warned of the storm's potential flooding and coastal impacts. The <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> advised all small craft south of Port O'Connor, Texas to remain in port. Notifications of Janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, ESSA {{transferred}} the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey′s Seismology Data Centers to Asheville, North Carolina, where they {{merged with the}} U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau′s</b> National <b>Weather</b> Records Center to create ESSA′s Environmental Data Center.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Davis and George P. Migo won the United States <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> {{public service}} award for taking off in two planes {{alongside}} a Tornado that formed near Chicago, and flew {{ahead of its}} path warning {{people on the ground}} and via radio.|$|R
2500|$|After the war Gunn became {{director}} of the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> Physical Research Division, where he carried {{out a series of}} studies into atmospheric phenomena. In 1958 he became a professor of physics at American University, a position he held until his death in 1966.|$|R
5|$|The season officially {{began on}} June15, the date that the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> office in Miami, Florida, under the {{direction}} of Gordon Dunn, began daily monitoring of all tropical disturbances and cyclones across the northern Atlantic Ocean. The agency had access to the Hurricane Hunters, a fleet of aircraft that obtain data by flying into storms. The <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau,</b> in collaboration with other agencies, began a fiveyear project in 1956 to obtain and analyze data on the structure of hurricanes. The season officially ended on November15.|$|E
5|$|While Esther was {{becoming}} a powerful hurricane over the open Atlantic, the San Juan <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> office issued a small craft advisory for the Leeward Islands, United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. Because of uncertainty about the storm's future path, the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> advised residents along {{the east coast of}} the United States to closely follow the storm. The agency later issued a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September 18.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its large}} swath of destruction, the name Janet was retired by the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau,</b> {{becoming}} just the seventh Atlantic tropical cyclone {{to have its}} name retired, and the fourth to be retired in 1955.|$|E
60|$|WEATHER, n. The {{climate of}} the hour. A {{permanent}} topic of conversation among persons whom it does not interest, but who have inherited the tendency to chatter about it from naked arboreal ancestors whom it keenly concerned. The setting up official <b>weather</b> <b>bureaus</b> and their maintenance in mendacity prove that even governments are accessible to suasion by the rude forefathers of the jungle.|$|R
50|$|Bucci {{spent most}} of his career in Maryland and the Washington, D.C. area. He worked for the U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> National Meteorological Center in Maryland from 1956 until his {{retirement}} in 1979. He exhibited work in numerous D.C.-area galleries and {{served as president of the}} Washington Water Color Association from 1963-65. In 1983, Bucci was artist-in-residence for a semester at Delta State University. He had recently resettled in Vicksburg at the time of his death.|$|R
50|$|Work {{soon began}} to re-establish the daily weather {{forecast}} broadcasts. In January 1920, reports from both the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> Eric R. Miller and the University's physics department stated that the transmissions would soon restart, this time by radiotelephone. However, when the service was reintroduced in February, the forecasts were still being sent only in Morse code. During the University's summer break the weather forecast broadcasts were temporarily suspended, then restarted in September.|$|R
5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of Ilsa, the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> issued a gale warning and hurricane watch for the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and northern Puerto Rico. However, no damage was reported. The storm caused extensive beach erosion and squally conditions in Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, Governor of North Carolina Luther H. Hodges and United States Senator from North Carolina B. Everett Jordan {{requested}} a disaster declaration for the state. President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower designated portions of North Carolina {{impacted by the}} storm as a disaster area. According to the American Red Cross, at least 5,000people were kept in shelters after Helene. Following the large-scale evacuation procedures and resulting low loss of life after the storm, the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> recommended that certain organizations be awarded the Outstanding Service to the Public certificate due to their cooperation with the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> during the hurricane's duration. The recommended recipients were the radio stations WPTF and WRAL, and the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.|$|E
5|$|On July15, the Central <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> {{issued a}} sea warning for the Bashi Channel and waters off the {{southeast}} coast of Taiwan. Residents were also warned of possible heavy, flooding rains and were urged to take precautions to minimize loss of life.|$|E
50|$|The United States <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> National Hurricane Research Project, {{founded in}} 1955, had {{as one of}} its {{objectives}} to investigate the scientific validity of hurricane modification methods. To this end, silver iodide dispensers were tested in Hurricane Daisy in August 1958. The flares were deployed outside of the hurricane eyewall, so this was an equipment test rather than a modification experiment. The equipment malfunctioned in {{all but one of the}} flights, and no conclusive data was acquired.|$|R
5|$|The National Hotel Artist Lofts (NHAL) is an Artspace-developed {{property}} featuring twenty-seven live/work units {{designated as}} affordable housing for artists. The project brought {{new life to}} the historic E.S. Levy Building, which was left abandoned for twenty years. Originally built as the Tremont Opera House in 1870, the structure was extensively renovated to serve various functions, from offices and stores to the National Hotel. The building also housed the U.S. National <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> Galveston office under Isaac Cline during the 1900 Storm.|$|R

5|$|The 1951 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} {{hurricane season}} in which tropical cyclones were officially named by the United States <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau.</b> The season officially started on June15, when the United States <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone activity; the season officially ended on November15. It was the first year since 1937 in which no hurricanes made landfall on the United States; as Hurricane How was the only tropical storm to hit the nation, the season had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season. As in the 1950 season, names from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were used to name storms this season.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} was identified by the National <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> in San Francisco, California on July15. The previous day, the S.S. Garvel Park recorded sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) when it was situated roughly 75mi (120km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Although listed as a Category 1 hurricane for its entire known existence by the hurricane database, the storm was not confirmed to have attained hurricane intensity until July21. The storm took a steady westward track during the early portion of its existence {{in response to a}} strong ridge located north of Hawaii. On July18, the National <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> discontinued advisories on the storm as no information on it was being received.|$|E

5000|$|Horace Robert Byers (March 12, 1906 - May 22, 1998) was an American {{meteorologist}} who pioneered {{in aviation}} meteorology, synoptic weather analysis (weather forecasting), severe convective storms, cloud physics, and weather modification. Byers is most {{well known for}} his work as director of U.S. <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> Thunderstorm Project in which, among other things, the modern cell morphology and life cycle of a thunderstorm were established. He is also known for his professional involvement with Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby and Tetsuya Theodore Fujita.|$|R
50|$|Winburn {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in the implementation of}} the first operational weather radars. In 1952, a Radar Storm Detection Unit, which was a modified World War II Navy radar, was installed in Amarillo. Then, in 1961, one of the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> first network <b>weather</b> radars (WSR-57) was commissioned in Amarillo. Other rapid changes in technology were ushered in by Winburn, such as the installation of warning teletype communications in 1955, and the transfer of Upper Atmospheric (Radiosonde) observations to the local office in 1956.|$|R
5|$|The tornado {{prediction}} {{proved to}} be successful, even if its precision was mostly due to chance. Before this point, the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> had a policy against issuing tornado warnings, mainly due to fear of panic by the public, and subsequent complacency if forecasts {{turned out to be}} false alarms.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{perceived to}} be a potential threat to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September13, mitigating any evacuation procedures. Despite the storm's change in track, the United States <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas. Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm. After the hurricane recurved, the <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> advised caution to areas of the New England coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated. Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September16. The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas.|$|E
5|$|About 36hours {{prior to}} the {{hurricane}} making landfall, {{when it was still}} south of Cuba, the Miami <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau</b> issued a hurricane alert for South Florida. About 18hours before landfall, the alert was replaced by a hurricane warning. The advance warning time was believed to have prevented many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations, such as securing windows.|$|E

2500|$|Hollis House {{is today}} the {{location}} of a number of classrooms and offices of the College of Liberal Arts. Built in 1852, the building was until 1909 the house of a number of prominent residents of Northfield. When sold that year to the university, it became part of the US <b>Weather</b> <b>Bureau's</b> station collocated on campus. The building was later named for David B. [...] "Dixie" [...] Hollis (NU 1922) who upon his death in 1993 gave what was then the largest donation in the university's history: $7 million.|$|R
50|$|Australia also {{experienced}} its hottest summer on average following a particularly hot spell in January. Using average {{day and night}} temperatures the average {{was found to be}} 28.6 C beating the previous record set in the summer of 1997-1988. Fourteen of the <b>weather</b> <b>bureau's</b> 112 long term weather stations recorded their hottest days on record including one in Sydney that recorded a daytime record of 46 C. The daytime maximum temperatures for 2012-13 also beat the 1982-83 record and January was the hottest month since records began in 1910.|$|R
