After detailed literature review it was hypothesized that (1) Children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in joint family structure will have more psychological problems as compared to the children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in nuclear family structure. (2) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in nuclear family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in joint family structure. (3) Children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in joint family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working mothers in joint family structure. (4) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in joint family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of non- <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in joint family structure. (5) Children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in nuclear family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working mothers in nuclear family structure. (6) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in nuclear family structure as compared to the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of non- <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in nuclear family structure. On hypothesis 1, 3 and 5 the difference will be evident on the variables of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problems, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment Sample of the present research consisted of 256 Adolescent children of the working and non <b>working</b> <b>mothers,</b> including 64 children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children of non <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female), and 64 children of non <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female). Their age range was from 12 years to 18 years. Subjects were interviewed & then SPM, WRAT-R & RASSI were administered according to standard procedure test was calculated {{in order to determine the}} difference of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problem, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment between the Adolescent children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in joint family structure and Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in nuclear family structure. Pearson Product Moment Coefficient Correlation was applied to analyze the relationship between the intellectual capacity and academic achievement of Adolescent children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in joint family structure and Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in nuclear family structure. Further z-test was calculated to determine the significant difference between correlations of above mentioned groups. The results showed significant differences between adolescent children of employed mothers of two family structures (Joint and nuclear) on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems, Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment. There was a significant difference on the variables of Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment and insignificant differences on other two variables i. e. of Antisocial behavior and Anger control problems, between adolescents children of <b>working</b> and Non-working <b>mothers</b> in joint family structures.

40|$|With the {{increase}} in the number of women working in the formal economy, there has been a growing literature on women handling multiple roles arising from work and the home. Currently there is a gap in the literature about the activities of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in emerging economies, with theories and most findings concentrated on studies in advanced economies. This study therefore intends to fill part of the gap in the literature by investigating the lives of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria, with a view of understanding their challenges, pains and gains as they navigate between the home and work spheres. This research adopted a qualitative approach through the administration of semi-structured interviews to <b>working</b> <b>mothers,</b> supervisors and Human Resources practitioners. Using the Greenhaus and Beutell’s (1985) sources of conflict model, this study explored the work and family lives of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in Nigeria, thereby giving a detailed view of the time, strain and behaviour-based conflict they experience, as well as appropriate coping strategies that have been put in place to mitigate the effects of such conflicts. Findings complement earlier studies on work and family in Africa focusing on the experience of strain by <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in Nigeria. However, analysis from this study suggests that some of these stress-related conflicts were caused by the prevalent work culture of presenteeism. In comparing evidence of a more equal sharing of domestic tasks between couples in advanced economies, the embrace of equal sharing of housework by men and a demand for such by women in Nigeria is rather limited and slow.

40|$|Choice or Constraint {{ideas have}} {{dominated}} theoretical {{approaches to the}} study of women’s lives. Preference theory, postulated by Hakim (1996; 2000) contrasts with the ‘constraints ideology’ evident in the work of Walby (1990) and Crompton (1997; 2006). This study revisits this dichotomy with the purpose of a thematic exploration of the stories of a group of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in Ireland. The lived experiences of <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> are thematically explored using a sample of 11 mothers who work in paid employment outside the home. Significant themes illuminate the role of maternal grandmothers and husbands/partners in the mothers’ search for balance between their home and work lives A biographical narrative approach is adopted within this study within an interpretive phenomenological epistemology where, through in-depth interviews, <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> explore their experiences of work and home domains. Data presented is evidenced from two qualitative interviews with each participant; one in Spring 2009 and interview two in Autumn 2009. The creative use of second interviews creates a conversational space in which the mothers reflected on their daily lives as they cope with ‘competing devotions’ (Blair-Loy 2003) of work and home. This study highlights that while <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> make choices with regard to paid work outside the home they do so within constraints. Given the competing devotions (Blair-Loy 2003) of home and work domains faced by <b>working</b> <b>mothers,</b> many of the <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in this study did take up formal work-life balance initiatives, while others relied on informal work-life balance supports from line managers and colleagues in particular. Despite these work-life supports the <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> in this study not only faced the responsibilities of ‘the second shift’ (Hochschild 1989) but also evidenced the presence of ‘the third shift’ (Hochschild 1997; Kremen Bolton 2000) in their daily negotiations between choice or constraint across work and home domains.
