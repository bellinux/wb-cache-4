25|$|In 1929, the Tajik outlaw Habib Ullah Kalakani, {{known to}} history as Bacha ye Saqqao (son of the <b>water-carrier),</b> ousted Aman Ullah Khan and {{took control of}} Kabul for nine months (January to October 1929). During this {{uprising}} Faiz Mohammad, who spent almost the entire period inside the city, kept a journal which {{was the basis for}} an unfinished monograph entitled Kitab-e Tadakoor-e Enqilab which he began shortly after the fall of Bacha ye Saqqao.|$|E
25|$|Eldon {{was born}} in Newcastle upon Tyne. His grandfather, William Scott of Sandgate, a street {{adjacent}} to the Newcastle quayside, was clerk to a fitter, a sort of <b>water-carrier</b> and broker of coals. His father, whose name also was William, began life as an apprentice to a fitter, in which service he obtained the freedom of Newcastle, becoming {{a member of the}} guild of Hostmen (coal-fitters); later in life he became a principal in the business, and attained a respectable position as a merchant in Newcastle, accumulating property worth nearly £20,000.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thus do we beg {{who know}} the way of it,' said he proudly to the lama, who opened his eyes at the {{contents}} of the bowl. 'Eat now and--I will eat with thee.

50|$|Ali {{brought the}} <b>water-carriers</b> before Muhammad. From them {{he learned that}} the caravan of the Quraysh had already escaped, and that the Muslims, at that very moment, were confronted by the army of Mecca.|$|R
50|$|In Gujarat, their {{traditional}} occupations include acting as palanquin-bearers, fishermen and <b>water-carriers.</b> They {{are a very}} low-ranked caste but not so low as to be untouchable. There, according to The People of India, the community comprises various endogamous sub-groups.|$|R
60|$|Finally, the menial {{establishment}} of the Mosque consists of a Shaykh al-Sakka (chief of the <b>water-carriers),</b> under whom are from forty-five to fifty men who sprinkle the floors, water the garden, and, for a consideration, supply a cupful of brackish liquid to visitors.|$|R

5000|$|Yvon Deschamps' monologues {{were known}} for their unrelenting irony, and often buried a message that was {{completely}} opposite to what the stage character was saying literally. For Deschamps' first monologue, Les unions, qu'ossa donne?, he created an exploited worker who incarnated the Québécois self-image of a historic past as <b>water-carriers</b> and hewers of wood, and who remained resolutely blind to his exploitation {{at the hands of}} his [...] "good" [...] boss.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.331] Unfortunately for me, the boy Mohammed had donned that grand {{embroidered}} coat. At {{the end of}} {{the ceremony}} the Aghas, or eunuchs of the Mosque, a race of men considered respectable by their office, and prone to make themselves respected by the freest administration of club-law, assembled in Al-Rauzah to offer me the congratulation Ziyaratak Mubarak-"Blessed be thy Visitation,"-and to demand fees. Then came the Sakka, or <b>water-carrier</b> of the Mosque well, Zemzem,[FN#67] offering a tinned saucer filled from the holy source. And lastly I was beset by beggars.|$|E
60|$|In Pyeng-yang I {{became a}} <b>water-carrier,</b> for {{know that that}} old city, whose walls were ancient even {{in the time of}} David, was {{considered}} by the people to be a canoe, and that, therefore, to sink a well inside the walls would be to scupper the city. So all day long thousands of coolies, water-jars yoked to their shoulders, tramp out the river gate and back. I became one of these, until Chong Mong-ju sought me out, and I was beaten and planked and set upon the highway.|$|E
60|$|It {{appears from}} Sleeman that in India the {{occupation}} of elephant-driver is confined to Mohammedans. I wonder why that is. The <b>water-carrier</b> ('bheestie') is a Mohammedan, but {{it is said that}} the reason of that is, that the Hindoo's religion does not allow him to touch the skin of dead kine, and that is what the water-sack is made of; it would defile him. And it doesn't allow him to eat meat; the animal that furnished the meat was murdered, and to take any creature's life is a sin. It is a good and gentle religion, but inconvenient.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Noah and the flood, the third {{play in the}} Chester cycle, was {{originally}} performed by the city's Guild of the Drawers of Dee, otherwise known as the <b>water-carriers.</b> A feature of this play, observed by the historian Rosemary Woolf, is the depiction of Noah's wife, and by implication women generally, as disobedient, obdurate and finally abusive, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "grave and obedient" [...] Noah and his patient sons.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} {{was home to}} a mixed population of Egyptians, Nubians and Asiatics who were employed as labourers, (stone-cutters, plasterers, <b>water-carriers),</b> {{as well as those}} involved in the administration and decoration of the royal tombs and temples. The artisans and the village were organised into two groups, left and right gangs who worked {{on opposite sides of the}} tomb walls similar to a ship's crew, with a foreman for each who supervised the village and its work.|$|R
50|$|Muhammad did {{not know}} that an army had left Mecca, was marching toward Medina to protect the caravan of the Quraysh, and to {{challenge}} the Muslims. When Muhammad arrived in the environs of Badr, he sent Ali to reconnoiter the surrounding country. At the wells of Badr, Ali surprised some <b>water-carriers.</b> In reply to his questions, they told him that they were carrying water for an army which came from Makkah, and which was encamped {{on the other side of}} the nearby hills.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{surprises me}} more," [...] said Foster, {{as they walked}} along, [...] "than to see such {{beautiful}} wells and fountains in streets so narrow that one actually has not enough room {{to step back and}} look at them properly. Look at that one now, with the negress, the Moor, and the <b>water-carrier</b> waiting their turn while the little girl fills her water-pot. See what labour has been thrown away on that fountain. What elegance of design, what columns of sculptured marble, and fine tessellated work stuck up where few people can see it, even when they try to." ...|$|E
6000|$|A <b>water-carrier</b> passes {{along with}} a {{creaking}} barrow, slopping the [...] water as he goes; an old blind woman, a masseuse, advances slowly, [...] striking wooden clappers to proclaim her calling. A musician stands [...] on the curb and plays a tuneless melody on a one-stringed fiddle. [...] From the distance comes the muffled sound of gongs. There is a [...] babel of sound caused by the talking of all these people, by the [...] cries of coolies, the gong, the clappers, and the fiddle. From [...] burning joss-sticks in the shops {{in front of the}} household god [...] comes a savour of incense.|$|E
60|$|Thus Bray! Alas, none {{of these}} {{possibilities}} occurred. He found the spring had simply lapsed into its previous unsuggestive obscurity,--a mere niche in the mountain side that held only--water! The stage road was deserted save for an early, curly-headed schoolboy, whom he found lurking on the bank, but who evaded his company and conversation. He returned to the camp quite cured of his fancy. His late zeal as a <b>water-carrier</b> had earned him a day or two's exemption from that duty. His place was taken the next afternoon by the woman-hating Parkhurst, {{and he was the}} less concerned by it as he had heard that the same afternoon the ladies were to leave the summit for Sacramento.|$|E
6000|$|Go farther still: {{go to the}} Moorish Mountains, {{sparkling}} full in the moonlight--go {{among the}} <b>water-carriers</b> and the village gossips, living still as in days of old--and who has travelled among them before you, and peopled the Alhambra and made eloquent its shadows? Who awakes there a voice from every hill and in every cavern, and bids legends, which for centuries have slept a dreamless sleep, or watched unwinkingly, start up and pass before you in all their life and glory? ...|$|R
40|$|A walk {{about time}} and the land, exile and belonging, the drift of memory and forgetting: memorializing in an era dense with anniversaries Forced Walks is a {{proposed}} programme of artist-led performative, socially engaged public walks, digitally connected and mindful of workers, refugees, migrants, tramps, <b>water-carriers</b> and others who were/are forced to walk. The walks and related social media activity seek to generate contemporary and locative resonances, reveal the obscured stories of those dispossessed of land and home by war, economic and climate change...|$|R
50|$|A woman {{lived with}} her {{mother-in-law}} and daughter; though she was dutiful, her mother-in-law hated her. One day, she decreed {{that they could not}} buy water from <b>water-carriers,</b> but her daughter-in-law would have to carry it from the well. The work was too hard for her, but she was beaten when she failed. One day, she thought of drowning herself in the well. An old woman told her not to, and gave her a stick to strike the pail with. She was to tell no one and to never strike twice.|$|R
6000|$|All {{perfectly}} true again. Was {{there not}} Private Valentine {{in that very}} house, acting as sole housemaid, valet, cook, steward, and nurse, in the family of his captain, Monsieur le Capitaine de la Cour,--cleaning the floors, making the beds, doing the marketing, dressing the captain, dressing the dinners, dressing the salads, and dressing the baby, all with equal readiness? Or, to put him aside, he being in loyal attendance on his Chief, was there not Private Hyppolite, billeted at the Perfumer's two hundred yards off, who, when not on duty, volunteered to keep shop while the fair Perfumeress stepped out {{to speak to a}} neighbour or so, and laughingly sold soap with his war-sword girded on him? Was there not Emile, billeted at the Clock-maker's, perpetually turning to of an evening, with his coat off, winding up the stock? Was there not Eugene, billeted at the Tinman's, cultivating, pipe in mouth, a garden four feet square, for the Tinman, in the little court, behind the shop, and extorting the fruits of the earth from the same, on his knees, with the sweat of his brow? Not to multiply examples, was there not Baptiste, billeted on the poor <b>Water-carrier,</b> at that very instant sitting on the pavement in the sunlight, with his martial legs asunder, and one of the Water-carrier's spare pails between them, which (to the delight and glory of the heart of the <b>Water-carrier</b> coming across the Place from the fountain, yoked and burdened) he was painting bright-green outside and bright-red within? Or, to go no farther than the Barber's at the very next door, was there not Corporal Theophile-- ...|$|E
60|$|As he drummed {{his heels}} against Zam-Zammah he turned {{now and again}} from his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the sweetmeat-seller's son, to make a rude remark to the native {{policeman}} on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned tolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So did the <b>water-carrier,</b> sluicing water on the dry road from his goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the Museum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases. So did everybody in sight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder House to view the things that men made in their own province and elsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures, and anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.|$|E
6000|$|Marmontel, whose account {{may have}} been {{coloured}} by retrospection in later years, says that before {{the success of the}} first Discourse, Rousseau concealed his pride under the external forms of a politeness that was timid even to obsequiousness; in his uneasy glance you perceived mistrust and observant jealousy; there was no freedom in his manner, and no one ever observed more cautiously the hateful precept to live with your friends as though they were one day to be your enemies.[221] Grimm's description is different and more trustworthy. Until he began to affect singularity, he says, Rousseau had been gallant and overflowing with artificial compliment, with manners that were honeyed and even wearisome in their soft elaborateness. All at once he put on the cynic's cloak, and went to the other extreme. Still in spite of an abrupt and cynical tone he kept much of his old art of elaborate fine speeches, and particularly in his relations with women.[222] Of his abruptness, he tells a most displeasing tale. [...] "One day Rousseau told us with an air of triumph, that as he was coming out of the opera where he had been seeing the first representation of the Village Soothsayer, the Duke of Zweibrücken had approached him with much politeness, saying, 'Will you allow me to pay you a compliment?' and that he replied, 'Yes, if it be very short.' Everybody was silent at this, until I said to him laughingly, 'Illustrious citizen and co-sovereign of Geneva, since there resides in you a part of the sovereignty of the republic, let me represent to you that, for all the severity of your principles, you should hardly refuse to a sovereign prince the respect due to a <b>water-carrier,</b> and that if you had met a word of good-will from a <b>water-carrier</b> with an answer as rough and brutal as that, you would have had to reproach yourself with a most unseasonable piece of impertinence.'"[223] ...|$|E
60|$|A troubled vision, then, of bridges, quays, interminable streets; of wine-shops, <b>water-carriers,</b> great {{crowds of}} people, soldiers, coaches, {{military}} drums, arcades. Of {{the monotony of}} bells and wheels and horses' feet being at length lost in the universal din and uproar. Of the gradual subsidence of that noise as he passed out in another carriage by a different barrier from that by which he had entered. Of the restoration, as he travelled on towards the seacoast, of the monotony of bells and wheels, and horses' feet, and no rest.|$|R
5000|$|On {{reaching}} the neighbourhood of Badr, Muhammad sent forward Ali, {{with a few}} others, to reconnoiter the rising ground above the springs. There they surprised three <b>water-carriers</b> of the enemy, as {{they were about to}} fill their sheepskins. One escaped to the Quraysh; the other two were captured and taken to the Muslim army. From them Muhammad discovered the proximity of his enemy. There were 950 men; more than threefold the number of the Moslem army. They were mounted on 700 camels and 100 horses, the horsemen all clad in mail. (Sir William Muir, The Life of Mohammed, London, 1877) ...|$|R
60|$|Saying this, he {{conducted}} our middy into a perfect labyrinth of narrow streets, {{through which he}} wended his way {{with a degree of}} certainty that told of intimate acquaintance. Foster observed that he nodded familiarly to many of those who crowded them--to Jews, Arabs, <b>water-carriers,</b> and negroes, {{as well as to the}} dignified men who kept little stalls and shops, many of which shops were mere niches in the sides of the houses. So close were the fronts of these houses to each other that in many places they almost met overhead and obscured much of the light.|$|R
