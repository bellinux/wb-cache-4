25|$|The <b>western</b> <b>school</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> vittata (also {{known as}} the banded whiting, golden whiting and bastard whiting), is a species of benthic marine fish in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The species {{is one of three}} 'school whiting' that inhabit {{southern}} Australia and share a very similar appearance. <b>Western</b> <b>school</b> whiting are known to grow to 30cm in length and 275 g in weight, although unconfirmed reports suggest this might be an underestimate. The <b>western</b> <b>school</b> whiting is distributed along the Western Australian coast from Maud Landing in the north to Rottnest Island in the south. The species inhabits both shallow inshore environments and waters to depths of 55 m. The species is a benthic predator, taking a variety of crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms, and shows a change in diet with age and habitat. S. vittata is a multiple spawner, reproducing between December and February once it has reached one or two years of age. Juveniles inhabit protected inshore waters, moving offshore once they reach sexual maturity. It is often found in association with other sillaginids and comprises a minor fraction of commercial whiting catches in Western Australia.|$|R

50|$|The various {{common names}} of the {{so-called}} 'school whitings' is complicated, with the original use of <b>western</b> and eastern <b>school</b> whiting to describe S. bassensis and S. flindersi affected by the naming of a third species of <b>school</b> whiting; <b>Sillago</b> vittata.

The local name of 'red-spot whiting' refers to the diagonal lines of red spots present on the fish's upper side. The rarely used name of 'Bass Straight whiting' refers to oceanic strait between the Victorian and Tasmanian coastlines, where large quantities of the species are taken in trawls.|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>school</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> bassensis, (also {{known as}} the silver whiting or trawl whiting) is a common species of coastal marine fish of the smelt-whiting family that inhabits the south and south-west coasts of Australia. Its distribution overlaps {{a number of other}} common sillaginids, with careful observation of anatomical features occasionally needed to distinguish between species. The southern school whiting is closely related to the eastern <b>school</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> flindersi, and initially were thought to be all one species. The species inhabits both shallow inshore sandy waters, as well as deeper offshore waters, with a transition of habitats occurring with increasing age. It is a predatory fish, taking a variety of crustaceans, polychaetes and bivalves as prey. It reaches sexual maturity at three years of age, and spawns multiple times between December and April. The southern school whiting is commonly caught by commercial and recreational fishermen, often while fishing for related species, especially the sought after King George whiting. The species is marketed fresh in southern Australia.|$|R
