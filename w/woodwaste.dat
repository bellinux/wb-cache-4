50|$|Bio-energy is {{a source}} of {{renewable}} energy that uses a variety of organic materials, referred to as biomass. Biomass is any biological material in liquid, solid, or gaseous form that is either a product of direct-photosynthesis or indirect-photosynthesis. These products include: <b>woodwastes,</b> municipal solid waste, manures, agricultural substances, separated household waste and sewage sludge, wastes streams, and also remaining substances found in forestry and related industries. However, the most commonly employed biomass is wood; as wood waste can be easily combusted to produce heat for industrial facilities, create steam for electricity production, and also for water and space heating.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{commissioned}} by NEFA to develop a working estimate of the four-state region's woodflow balance and to develop recommendations for ongoing tracking of woodflows. This woodflow balance covers primary products cut from the forest and not items such as sawmill chips, <b>woodwastes,</b> or market pulp. In this report, data for softwood and hardwood are provided, but individual species are not considered. This study involved compiling different sources of government and private data on primary wood production, interstate wood movements, and international trade flows. These sources have various limitations that are described. Certain sources may have limited use for adding up a quantitative wood balance, but may still be very useful for monitoring market conditions and trends. Considerable judgment was used in fitting together the regional balance. A preliminary working estimate of woodflow for primary products was assembled for the four-state region, supplemented by analysis of trade data in dollars. The region has a wood trade surplus with Canada and offshore nations of $ 250 million {{per year in the}} primary products covered in this report. Additionally, flows to and from Canada and between states are important to individual mills and entire regions...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) {{entered into}} Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41108 with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) for an Agenda 2020 project {{to develop an}} {{advanced}} biomass gasification-based power generation system for near-term deployment in the Forest Products Industry (FPI). The advanced power system combines three advanced components, including biomass gasification, 3 -stage stoker-fired combustion for biomass conversion, and externally recuperated gas turbines (ERGTs) for power generation. The primary performance goals for the advanced power system are to provide increased self-generated power production for the mill and to increase wastewood utilization while decreasing fossil fuel use. Additional goals are to reduce boiler NOx and CO{sub 2 } emissions. The current {{study was conducted to}} determine the technical and economic feasibility of an Advanced Power Generation System capable of meeting these goals so that a capital investment decision can be made regarding its implementation at a paper mill demonstration site in DeRidder, LA. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were developed for all major equipment, boiler modifications and balance of plant requirements including all utilities required for the project. A three-step implementation plan was developed to reduce technology risk. The plant design was found to meet the primary objectives of the project for increased bark utilization, decreased fossil fuel use, and increased self-generated power in the mill. Bark utilization for the modified plant is significantly higher (90 - 130 %) than current operation compared to the 50 % design goal. For equivalent steam production, the total gas usage for the fully implemented plant is 29 % lower than current operation. While the current average steam production from No. 2 Boiler is about 213, 000 lb/h, the total steam production from the modified plant is 379, 000 lb/h. This steam production increase will be accomplished at a grate heat release rate (GHRR) equal to the original boiler design. Boiler efficiencies (cogeneration-steam plus air) is increased from the original design value of 70 % to 78. 9 % due to a combination of improved burnout, operation with lower excess air, and drier fuel. For the fully implemented plant, the thermal efficiency of fuel to electricity conversion is 79. 8 % in the cogeneration mode, 5 % above the design goal. Finally, self-generated electricity will be increased from the 10. 8 MW currently attributable to No. 2 Boiler to 46. 7 MW, an increase of 332 %. Environmental benefits derived from the system include a reduction in NOx emissions from the boiler of about 30 - 50 % (90 - 130 tons/year) through syngas reburning, improved carbon burnout and lower excess air. This does not count NOx reduction that may be associated with replacement of purchased electricity. The project would reduce CO{sub 2 } emissions from the generation of electricity to meet the mill's power requirements, including 50, 000 tons/yr from a net reduction in gas usage in the mill and an additional 410, 000 tons/yr reduction in CO{sub 2 } emissions due to a 34 MW reduction of purchased electricity. The total CO{sub 2 } reduction amounts to about 33 % of the CO{sub 2 } currently generated to meet the mills electricity requirement. The overall conclusion of the study is that while significant engineering challenges are presented by the proposed system, they can be met with operationally acceptable and cost effective solutions. The benefits of the system can be realized in an economic manner, with a simple payback period on the order of 6 years. The results of the study are applicable to many paper mills in the U. S. firing <b>woodwastes</b> and other solid fuels for steam and power production...|$|R

40|$|Leachate was {{generated}} when precipitation percolated through {{a pile of}} <b>woodwaste,</b> including trimmings, off-specification wood chips, shredded bark and roots, and sawdust from several cedar processing mills. The “young ” <b>woodwaste</b> leachate produced in the pile’s placement period was amber, acidic (pH 3. 4 – 3. 7), nutrient-poor (inorganic nitrogen 1. 4 – 3. 2 mg L- 1, orthophosphate 3. 3 – 4. 3 mg P L- 1), of very high oxygen demand (chemical oxygen demand 12, 559 – 14, 254 mg L- 1, tannin and lignin 3066 – 5150 mg L- 1 as tannic acid, volatile fatty acids 1564 – 2132 mg L- 1), and very toxic to aquatic life (96 -h median lethal concentration of 0. 74 % leachate).

40|$|Issue: Various sources {{generate}} wood waste; this variability {{causes it}} to usually contain contaminants. These contaminants might {{not interfere with}} processing for particular end-products. For example, compost end-markets could be indifferent to the dirt and grit commonly found in wood waste, whereas composite panel-board markets could have trouble during manufacturing and with end-product performance. However, the end-uses that tolerate contaminants in recovered wood waste generally have the lowest-value markets. To successfully compete with virgin wood materials in higher-value markets, wood-waste processors must minimize the presence of contaminants in their end products. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends that operators {{become aware of the}} common <b>woodwaste</b> contaminants that pose problems for end users. This awareness is among the first steps in achieving satisfactory quality control in wood-waste processing. Visually inspect all incoming loads of material to identify contamination.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the environmental impact of fossil fuels (mainly coal) combustion, which leads to high levels of CO 2, NO x, SO 2, mercury and particulate emissions, has motivated research for potential alternatives such as switching from fossil fuels to biomass, or co-firing of both fuels. Co-firing proved to be a promising technology for large scale use of biomass for energy production, as it makes use of the extensive infrastructure associated with the existing coal-based power systems, and requires only relatively modest additional capital investment to achieve a significant CO 2 reduction. The research objectives of the present work were to: (1) Investigate on combustion/cofiring lignite and woodwaste/peat in a 16. 19 kW pilot-scale fluidized-bed combustor, and effects of fuel-blending ratios, excess air, particle size and moisture contents on CO 2, CO, SO 2, and NO x emissions in the combustion/co-combustion; and (2) Study the combustion reactivity of lignite, <b>woodwaste,</b> peat, and the blended fuels using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The combustion/co-combustion behaviour and kinetics of lignite, peat and <b>woodwaste</b> (white pine sawdust) and their blends were investigated using non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique. The TGA experiments were performed for pure fuels and compared to blended fuels with respect to their performance in air over a temperature range of 25 - 700 ?c and at a heating rate of 20 ?C/min. The overall kinetic de-volatilization-combustion reactions for these fuels and their blends were evaluated using the power law model. Using the differential thermal analysis (DTA) data and applying the least square multi-linear regression method, kinetic parameters for the overall devolatilization/combustion reactions including the apparent activation energy (E a), reaction order (n) and the pre-exponential (A) factor were calculated for each homogeneous fuel and the lignite-peat or lignite-pine sawdust blended fuels (50 wt%- 50 wt%%). The wood waste and peat demonstrated a higher reactivity when compared to lignite. The activation energies for lignite, peat, and white pine were determined to be 124. 10 kJ/mol, 83. 95 kJ/mol, and 98. 23 kJ/mol, respectively. Compared with the devolatilization/combustion of homogenous solid fuels, blending peat/white pine with lignite resulted in synergistic effects, enhancing the combustion reactivity of each component fuel...|$|E

40|$|Issue: Wood-waste {{generators}} use single roll-off box containers {{or large}} dump trucks when hauling to solid-waste collection facilities. The facility {{does not necessarily}} identify the wood-waste generator because the wood-waste delivery might be mixed with other material. Nor do disposal fees at collection facilities account for source generators. Private landfills and transfer stations collect most wood waste. For billing, personnel at their scalehouses usually record the quantity of waste delivered and who delivered it. Typically, this method to account for waste conceals {{the identities of the}} actual generators. Most facilities do not separate <b>woodwaste</b> nor charge unique fees. They commingle wood waste with garbage in drop boxes that can be (un) loaded automatically. These are either front-end loader boxes from small- to mid-sized generators or big roll-off boxes from larger generators. However, private recyclers introduced and now provide source-separation and separate hauling systems. Those in competitive markets rapidly developed separating systems, which have become common. Many wood-waste materials that solid-waste facilities never-before handled (such as landclearing stumps and brush or orchard prunings) are now increasingly processed and marketed by private facilities. When using separating systems, identifying and sorting the wood portion of the waste stream becomes critical. Best Practice: To implement a separating system, identify the generating sources from which to collect wood waste. This Best Practice recommends using state and local databases, which list statistics about the typical composition of industrial waste, to classify prospective regional generators by their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Every private company has a four-digit SIC code that federal, state, or local governmental databases can provide. Then, cross-reference their SIC codes against others that have the highest rates of waste-wood generation (e. g., pallet repair, home builders, cabinet manufacturers, lumber yards, etc.).
