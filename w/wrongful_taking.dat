25|$|In {{the case}} of Bishop v Viscountess Montague , the opinion was offered that the {{plaintiff}} could elect between action in trover and action in trespass as a remedy for <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trespass and trover {{were both}} actions founded upon possession. For many centuries, they were {{alternative}} remedies for the <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of, or damage to chattels. There was {{a distinction between}} the actions. In the theory of trespass, the plaintiff remained the owner of the chattel, with the possession or property rights interrupted or interfered with. In this case, the plaintiff must accept the chattel back when it was tendered. Recovery was limited to any damage to the chattel, or from the interruption of property rights.|$|E
25|$|Trover damages {{came to be}} {{measured}} by {{the market value of}} the object, not necessarily its replacement cost if it were new. Sometimes, compensation for deprivation of use and compensation for other losses naturally and proximately caused by the <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> could be added. Case law results are mixed. The plaintiff could also recover interest that would have been earned by the money value of the object and any expense (except attorney's fees) incurred in attempting to recover the object. If the taker sold the object for more than its market value, the plaintiff could receive the higher price. However, selling the chattel could change the action to that of a true conversion which was a form of theft. If the taker had made improvements on the object (e.g., repainted it), the value of such improvements are not deducted from the plaintiff's recovery unless the taking was by mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Trover {{is a form}} of {{lawsuit in}} common-law {{countries}} for recovery of damages for <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of personal property. [...] Trover belongs to a series of remedies for such <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking,</b> its distinctive feature being recovery only for the value of whatever was taken, not for the recovery of the property itself (see replevin).|$|E
2500|$|Otherwise, {{conversion}} had {{its origin}} in the common law action in trover, as a branch of action on the case. [...] The earliest cases are most likely lost. [...] These probably involved cases when the finder of lost goods did not return them to the rightful owner, but used them himself or disposed of them to someone else. It became necessary to invent a new writ which covered the gap between action in trespass which lay for the <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of a chattel, and detinue which lay for its wrongful detention.|$|E
2500|$|In this case, {{the judges}} allowed action {{to be brought}} in trover where {{there had been a}} <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of a chattel.

5000|$|In common law, {{several types}} of action existed with respect to {{deprivation}} of possession (being subdivided into the <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of chattels and the unjust detention of them, even where the original taking was lawful): ...|$|E
50|$|STEALING: The <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking,</b> obtaining, or {{withholding}} by {{any means}} from the possession of the owner or any other person any money, personal property, article, or service of value of any kind, with intent to permanently deprive or defraud another person of the use and benefit of the property, or to appropriate it to either their own use {{or the use of}} any person other than the owner.|$|E
50|$|In tort law, detinue is {{an action}} to recover for the <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of {{personal}} property. It is initiated {{by an individual}} {{who claims to have}} a greater right to their immediate possession than the current possessor. For an action in detinue to succeed, a claimant must first prove that he had better right to possession of the chattel than the defendant and second that the defendant refused to return the chattel once demanded by the claimant.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, detinue is a {{possessory action}} having for its object the {{recovery}} of specific personal property and damages for its detention. At common law an action of detinue would lie for {{the recovery of}} specific personal property unlawfully detained, or its value, and for damages for its detention. Detinue differs from replevin in that possession of the chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed {{at the beginning of}} the proceeding. The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession of personal property which belongs to the plaintiff [...] whereas replevin lies only where there has been a <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> or seizure of the property. Detinue is distinguished from common-law trover which is for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property. In modern practice, detinue has been superseded almost entirely by statutory actions for the recovery of personal property.|$|E
40|$|This project {{follows the}} treaty-based legal efforts of sisters Mary and Carrie Dann in their fight to assert Western Shoshone land rights against the US government. Beginning with a 1952 claims {{case before the}} Indian Claims Commission, the US attempt to make restitutions for the <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of Western Shoshone lands itself {{threatened}} persistent Shoshone treaty rights. The Dann sisters, along with other, self-described Western Shoshone “traditionals”, undertook to reverse the federal liquidation of Shoshone treaty rights, engaging federal claims commissioners, attorneys, and courts along the way. Their legal activism relied heavily on the assertion of sovereign rights under the Western Shoshone’s 1863 treaty of peace and friendship with the United States. The Danns’ eventual representation before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights resulted in an important international censure against the United States’ indigenous policies. While the US government fervently prosecuted a claims award distribution that would liquidate Shoshone title to treaty lands, {{the official record of}} an alternative vision of Shoshone-US relations and the significance of the Treaty of Ruby Valley which the Danns helped to inscribe is a testament to the power of treaty-based Native activism in challenging federal authority in Indian affairs...|$|E
40|$|The {{manner in}} which {{conflicts}} between Aboriginal title to land and private third-party interests should be dealt with is {{a major issue in}} Canadian law and policy. The matter came up at trial in Tsilhqot 2 ̆ 7 in Nation v. British Columbia, and again was left unresolved. However, Justice Vickers did acknowledge the vital importance of the issue and the need to reconcile these conflicting interests through honourable negotiations. While admitting that a courtroom is not the appropriate forum for achieving reconciliation, he provided detailed analysis of the applicable legal principles and insights into the public policy considerations that should guide the negotiations. This article examines these aspects of Justice Vickers 2 ̆ 7 judgment and suggests more specific ways in which Aboriginal title and third-party interests might be reconciled through the process of negotiation. It proposes a context-based approach that seeks to redress the historical injustice of the <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> of Aboriginal lands, without disregarding the current interests of innocent third parties. The monetary costs of reconciliation, it is argued, should be borne by the real wrongdoers, namely the provincial and Canadian governments...|$|E
40|$|Oceanfront {{landowners and}} states share a {{property}} boundary that runs between the {{wet and dry}} parts of the shore. This legal coastline is different from an ordinary land boundary. First, on sandy beaches, the line is constantly in flux, and it cannot be marked except momentarily. Without {{the help of a}} surveyor and a court, neither the landowner nor a citizen walking down the beach has the ability to know exactly where the line lies. This uncertainty means that, as a practical matter, ownership of some part of the beach is effectively shared. Second, the common law establishes that the owner of each oceanfront lot holds easement-like interests in adjacent state-owned land; and, the state holds similar interests in the oceanfront lot. For these two reasons, the legal relationship between the oceanfront owner and the state is more interdependent than it may seem at first. It is much more than the usual neighbor relationship. Disputes over oceanfront property are often framed as cases of <b>wrongful</b> <b>taking</b> under the Fifth Amendment’s Just Compensation Clause. The Supreme Court has historically applied its standard takings test for determining whether or not a state is liable for the impact of its rules on a landowner’s rights. This Article is the first to examine the question of whether use of this standard test is optimal, or even logical, in cases between states and the owners of oceanfront land. Given the fact that climate change impacts such as sea-level rise are likely to increase rates of conflict along the legal coastline, the potential benefits of a test that takes into account the special relationship between these parties are significant. Support for an alternative test can be found in two sets of common law property rules, the upland rights and public trust doctrines, as well as in a mechanism that nineteenth-century courts used to resolve similar disputes...|$|E
