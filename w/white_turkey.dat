40|$|Abstract: The {{increased}} {{growth rate}} of Large <b>White</b> <b>turkeys</b> has prompted producers to change feeds at more frequent intervals than previously. However, nutrient recommendations by established {{agencies such as the}} National Research Council (1994) have not adjusted to this change. Using regression analysis of published amino acid recommendations, modified amino acid recommendations were calculated for feeding on three week intervals. Male Large <b>White</b> <b>turkeys</b> were fed diets formulated to provide from 90 to 115 % of the modified recommendations from day-old to 18 weeks of age; samples of the birds were processed to determine carcass characteristics. Based upon {{the results of the present}} study, the amino acid recommendations derived from regression analysis of NRC recommendations appear to be a good basis for use when changing diets at intervals of 3 week for male Large <b>White</b> <b>turkeys.</b> To insure maximum breast meat yield, these should be increased by approximately 5 %...|$|R

Diets were composed of ground yellow corn, dehulled soybean meal, 6 % stabilized fat, 4 % meat and bone meal,. 4 % methionine, minerals, and vitamins. A 3 X 3 factorial design of nine diets varying in protein (18, 21, and 24 %) and added lysine (0,. 1, and. 2 %) was used between 8 and 12 weeks of age. Birds were reassigned to new balanced pens {{at the end of each}} 4 -week period, and protein levels were reduced by 3. 0 %. The addition of 3 and 6 % protein, which provides. 22 and. 44 % lysine, to diets of turkeys be-tween 8 and 20 weeks of age increased body weight gains 18. 3 and 24. 7 %, respectively, in contrast to an increase of only 2. 2 and 3. 6 % from. 1 and. 2 % added L-lysineper se. The minimum protein requirements of Large <b>White</b> male <b>turkeys</b> at 10, 14, and 18 weeks of age are 21. 3, 19. 5, and 17. 6 % and for female turkeys 21. 7, 18. 4, and 15. 0 %, respectively. The minimum lysine require-ments of Large <b>White</b> <b>turkeys</b> to 12, 16, and 20 weeks of age are about 1. 4, 1. 2, and. 9 %, respec-tively, or 4. 5, 3. 7, and 3. 0 g/kcal metabolizable energy.

40|$|Summary. Semen {{samples were}} {{collected}} from ten Bronze and ten Beltsville Small <b>White</b> <b>turkeys</b> by the massage method without milking the copulatory organ. The birds were kept under natural conditions at Giza, Egypt (lat. 30 =deg). Four collections were tested each month throughout 1 year. The collections of alternate weeks were used for studying the physical and chemical characteristics respectively. The largest volumes of semen were produced between March and October, and the smallest between November and February. The best semen quality was recorded between November and April, and the poorest between May and August. A sharp decline in all semen characteristics occurred during May. If the causes of this decline can be avoided, the time of obtaining best semen qualities is prolonged. The semen pro-duction of Beltsville Small <b>White</b> <b>turkeys</b> was better {{than that of the}} Bronze breed. Wide seasonal variations in types of sperm abnormality were observed. Seminal fructose and vitamin C were high between November and April, and low from May to August. Semen quality was directly related to levels of seminal fructose and vitamin C. Slight seasonal and monthly variations were observed in inorganic phosphate levels. The rate of fructose metabolism by the spermatozoa was high during the first hour and decreased consistently thereafter.
