He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.|$|E

And the Soviets were now beginning to feel it, and the genius of Reagan, although I don’t think they had a plan in doing this is he instinctively realized that one of the ways to go after the Soviets was indirect, and that is you go after their proxies, you go after their allies, you go after their clients, or even in Afghanistan you go after them directly.

He has also said: [...] "It's about scenarios of despair, but people are finding the beauty in the very simple things in life." [...] Looking for [...] "some kind of resolver or conclusion" [...] to make the lyrics make sense, he came up with a chant: [...] "Magnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become things", a thought process based on the law of attraction from the book The Secret.

Following a two month break in early 2002, HIM regrouped and began rehearsing material for another album. Valo later credited the tour for Deep Shadow and Brilliant Highlights for bringing the band closer together, which culminated in their fourth album, entitled Love Metal. The album saw HIM once again working with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, and was viewed by the band {{as a reaction to}} the difficulties they faced during Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights. According to Valo: [...] "After what we considered a disappointment with Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, because there were so many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that <b>we</b> <b>control</b> what we do, and everybody else can fuck-off."

2500|$|In {{creating}} {{the world of}} Rapture, Levine imagined a utopia that its creators {{did not want the}} outside world to discover. Following this, he created the character of Ryan as its creator, giving him a [...] "pseudo-objectivism and extremely capitalistic view on the world" [...] as well as a fear of the New Dealers in the United States and communists in Russia would find it. Levine states that to him, Ryan's philosophies come from Art Deco, describing the style as, [...] "Yes, we are men, and <b>we</b> <b>control</b> the universe!" [...] He considered Ryan a combination of historical figures such as Howard Hughes and Ayn Rand, though comparing him to John Galt, a character in Rand's Atlas Shrugged, in that he is more similar to a real person, making mistakes and having fear and doubts. Levine purposely named Ryan as he did, using a semi-anagram of Ayn Rand's name to establish the connection. During a questions and answers segment, a questioner stated {{that he did not want}} to kill Ryan, asking Levine, [...] "Are still (sic) doomed to make games where we have to use plot devices to clean that up?" [...] to which Levine responded that video games were admittedly linear, saying that it was hard enough to come up with one good plot, let alone multiple ones. Levine stated that he did not expect the [...] "ugly comedown from the stratospheric highs" [...] from the Andrew Ryan scene near the end.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 1942, {{in light}} of the grim global situation, President Roosevelt called for a major {{reassessment}} of U.S. air power requirements, [...] "in order to have complete air ascendancy over the enemy." [...] The Japanese had expanded quickly in the Pacific Theater, North Africa was being rolled up by Rommel with Egypt threatened, Soviet forces were falling back against the German advances toward Stalingrad and the oilfields of the Caucasus, and German U-boats in the Atlantic sank 589 ships in early 1942. On 25 August, Arnold received word of the president's request from Army Chief of Staff George Marshall. The individual AWPD-1 team members had been reassigned {{to a wide variety of}} posts and duties, so to perform the reassessment Arnold recommended Hansell, recently made brigadier general. Marshall cabled Hansell in the UK where he had been working under General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Air Planner, and under General Carl Andrew Spaatz as Deputy Theater Air Officer. Marshall ordered Hansell to hurry back to AWPD and that [...] "the results of the work of this group are of such far-reaching importance that it will probably determine whether or not <b>we</b> <b>control</b> the air." [...] Hansell brought with him VIII Bomber Command Chief of Intelligence Colonel Harris Hull and RAF Group Captain Bobby Sharp, as well as the little data compiled from five UK-based raids which had been flown by U.S. bombers. Hansell was assisted on a consultative basis by George, Kuter and Walker, old AWPD-1 hands, and by Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Moss who was a sharp businessman in civil life. The team had just 11 days to finish the work. Arnold was more closely involved than before in leading the group and formulating the new plan. Like AWPD-1, the new framework was based largely on untried bombing theory. The report, entitled Requirements for Air Ascendancy, 1942, or AWPD-42, was submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) on 6 September 1942. Harry Hopkins had obtained his copy at 1am the day it was to be released, and Hopkins read it in time to tell Roosevelt over breakfast that the plan was sound. Roosevelt called Stimson to say he approved it, but Stimson hadn't seen it, nor had Marshall when Stimson called him. Hansell left hurriedly for England so that he would not have to face Marshall's anger at being caught unprepared.|$|E
