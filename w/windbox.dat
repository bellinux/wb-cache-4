Typical Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) catalyst with a mean particle size of 76 μm and a density of 1400 kg/m 3 was used. Both single and double-drainage protocols were tested. The local pressure drop and bed surface collapse height were acquired throughout the bed settling. Typical results were found regarding dense phase voidage of a fluidised bed and the bed surface collapse velocity. In addition, bubble fraction was calculated based on the collapse curve.

A description of fluid bed combustion is provided and, from this, the advantages of fluid bed systems are derived. Various fluid bed reactor systems and their applicability as a function of feed characteristics are discussed, including cold <b>windboxes</b> for autogenous feeds, hot <b>windboxes</b> for subautogenous feeds and in-bed steam coils for superautogenous feeds. The characteristics of waste feeds which make them suitable or unstable for combustion in a fluid bed system are discussed and examples of feeds currently burned in fluid bed systems are provided. The primary considerations in the heat balance are discussed and a simplified system for initial sizing for the reactor system is developed. This system is based on the input feed SFC (Specific Feed Characteristic), which is the gross heating value (HHV) per unit mass of moisture in the feed.

The main advantage of this capture technology {{is that there is no}} direct efficiency loss in obtaining the CO 2 in a separate stream. This study describes results from operation in a 100 kWth chemical-looping combustor for solid fuels. The oxygen carrier used was ilmenite, an iron-titanium oxide. Coal is fed directly into a loop seal, leading to the fuel reactor, through a set of screws. All parts of the unit are fluidized with steam, except for the air reactor, which is fluidized with air, and the loop seal with the fuel insertion, which is fluidized with nitrogen. All-in-all, the unit has eleven <b>windboxes,</b> of which four are loop seals. Three experiments have been conducted using a Colombian coal as fuel. Operation was stable and loss of char to the air reactor was small, meaning that the CO 2 capture efficiency was high (> 90 %).

The boiler was designed to operate with Soma lignite, with a lower heating value of 3550 kcal/kg. The current situation of one unit was simulated to determine the percentages of errors with respect to the design data.

ABBES and CeraMem reached agreement concerning Task 7 work, including ownership and disposition of project-purchased equipment to be used during Task 7 and also during Task 11. A test plan was prepared. Task 7 activities for the Low-NO{sub x} Firing System included computational modeling of the firing arrangement. Reasonable comparisons to experimental data previously obtained in the Boiler Simulation Facility were achieved. A kinetic evaluation for both baseline and low NO{sub x} firing arrangements was also performed, with results indicating that the final reducing zone within the main <b>windbox</b> has a dominant effect on NO{sub x} reduction, with higher temperatures being more favorable for lower NO{sub x}. A week of combustion testing was completed in the Fundamental Scale Burner Facility to examine the impact of integrated fuel staging (NO{sub x} reduction via the reburn mechanism), and to explore preliminary vertical staging concepts within the main <b>windbox</b> region. Preliminary results from this testing demonstrated the potential of vertical air staging within the main <b>windbox</b> to augment overfire air.

40|$|A widely-proposed way to {{retrofit}} {{coal-fired power plants}} with post-combustion CO 2 capture (PCC) is to supply all the electricity and heat required to operate the capture equipment from the existing steam cycle (an ‘integrated retrofit’), {{at the expense of}} a reduction in site power output. As an alternative, it is possible to add a gas turbine (GT) plant to maintain, or even increase, the net site power output. The GT can be integrated with the capture plant in various ways to supply {{all or part of the}} heat and power required for the capture and compression systems. But there is then the issue of how to capture the CO 2 emissions from the added GT plant. In this study a novel retrofit configuration is proposed. The exhaust gas of the GT replaces part of the secondary air for the coal boiler and a common capture system is used for both coal- and natural gas-derived CO 2. This new ‘GT flue gas <b>windbox</b> retrofit’ is based on the principles of previous hot <b>windbox</b> repowering proposals, with additional modifications to permit operation without extensive coal boiler modifications. To achieve this, the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) attached to GT is designed to maintain the main steam turbine flow rates and temperatures, to compensate for a necessary reduction in coal feed rates, and this, with the GT output, maintains the net power output of the site A techno-economic analysis of coal plants retrofitted with GT power cycles shows that these ‘power matched’ retrofits can be competitive with integrated retrofits at lower natural gas prices (as is now the case in North America). In particular, the novel GT flue gas <b>windbox</b> retrofit provides a promising alternative for adapting integrated capture retrofits that are initially designed for flexible operation with zero to full (~ 90 %) capture (as at the Boundary Dam 3 unit) for subsequent operation only with full capture. In this case the addition of a GT flue gas <b>windbox</b> retrofit will restore the full power output of the site with full CO 2 capture and using the original capture plant. In general, techno-economic analysis shows that the economic performance of GT retrofit options depends on the site power export capacity. If there is no limit on power export then retrofits may advantageously also include an additional steam cycle, to give a combined cycle with the GT, otherwise retrofits with a single pressure HRSG producing process steam only are preferred...|$|E

40|$|The {{aggressive}} {{nature of}} the flue gases in municipal waste incinerators does not allow the temperature of steam in the boiler to rise above 400 °C. An increase in steam temperature {{can be achieved by}} external superheating in a heat recovery steam generator positioned behind a gas turbine, so that steam of a higher energy content becomes available for electricity production. The paper addresses two basic schemes. In one case, steam generated at a waste-to-energy plant is superheated in a combined-cycle plant that operates in parallel. In the other case, the exhaust from a gas turbine plant is sent through a superheater section to the waste incinerator's boiler providing preheated combustion air. Performance of these configurations together with two modified schemes was analyzed in terms of efficiency, natural gas consumption and boiler surface area. An exergy analysis of the cases was carried out. The results showed that the integrated options can effect a substantial increase in efficiency.

40|$|In 1990, Congress enacted an {{amendment}} to the Clean Air Act that required reductions in NOx emissions through the application of low NOx burner systems on fossil fueled utility steam generators. For most of the existing steam generator population, the original burning equipment incorporated highly turbulent burners that created significant in-furnace flame interaction. Thus, the measurement and control of air flow to the individual burners was much less critical than in recent years with low NOx combustion systems. With low NOx sys-tems, the reduction of NOx emissions, as well as minimizing flyash unburned carbon levels, is very much dependent on the ability to control the relative ratios of air and fuel on a per-burner basis and their rate of mixing, particularly in the near burner zones. AMC Power (AMC) and DB Riley, Inc.

The results have improved burner optimization and provided real time continuous air flow balancing capability and the control of individual burner stoichiometries.

40|$|Electrostatic charge {{generation}} is unavoidable in gas-solid fluidized beds {{due to the}} repeated particle-particle and particle reactor wall contacts and separations. In industrial operations such as in polyethylene production this phenomenon results in the significant problem of reactor wall fouling, known as “sheeting”. To better understand the underlying charging mechanisms involved in gas-solid fluidized beds {{in an attempt to}} eliminate and/or reduce the effect a novel on-line electrostatic charge measurement technique was developed, which concurrently provided information on both the degree of fluidized bed electrification and reactor wall fouling. A Faraday cup replaced the <b>windbox</b> of the fluidized bed while another cup was placed {{at the top of the}} column. The distributor plate was uniquely designed for the systematic removal of bed particles and those adhered to the column wall for their charge measurement with the bottom Faraday cup, and the charge of the entrained particles was measured by the top Faraday cup. This is the first study which allowed the charge measurement of particles in the bulk of the bed, particles adhered to the column wall, and those entrained, simultaneously. In addition, this method uniquely permitted the evaluations of the degree of reactor wall fouling under different operating conditions. An experimental program was designed to investigate the influence of bed hydrodynamics (fluidizing gas velocity and particle size), fluidization column wall material, and the addition of different solid additives. Fluidizing particles were polyethylene resin from an industrial reactor. Bi-polar charging was observed where the elutriated particles were oppositely charged compared to those in the bulk of the bed and those adhered to the column wall. Particles within the wall coating were also found to be bi-polarly charged. With the resin tested as received, a certain sized particles (350 - 575 µm) adhered to the column wall. The specific charge of the particles near the column wall was found not to be a definite indication of the amount of wall fouling. Increasing the gas velocity promoted wall fouling and elevated the charge density of the particles within both bubbling and slugging flow regimes.

Increased utilisation of biomass for energy purposes incombined heat and power (CHP) plants can help the country meetits nuclear phase-out commitment. The present low-CO 2 emissioncharacteristics of the Swedish electricity production system(governed by hydropower and nuclear power) can be retained onlyby expansion of biofuels in the CHP sector. Domestic Swedishbiomass resources are vast and renewable, but not infinite. They should be utilised as efficiently as possible in order tomeet the conditions for sustainability in the future. Application of efficient power generation cycles at low cost isessential for meeting this challenge. This applies also tomunicipal solid waste (MSW) incineration with energyextraction, which is to be preferred to landfilling. Modern gas turbines and internal combustion engines firedwith natural gas have comparatively low installation costs,good efficiency characteristics and show reliable performancein power applications. Environmental and source-of-supplyfactors place natural gas at a disadvantage as compared tobiofuels. However, from a rational perspective, the use ofnatural gas (being the least polluting fossil fuel) togetherwith biofuels contributes to a diverse and more secure resourcemix. The question then arises if both these fuels can beutilised more efficiently if they are employed at the samelocation, in one combined cycle unit. The work presented herein concentrates on the hybriddual-fuel combined cycle concept in cold-condensing and CHPmode, with a biofuel-fired bottoming steam cycle and naturalgas fired topping gas turbine or engine. Higher electricalefficiency attributable to both fuels is sought, while keepingthe impact on environment at a low level and incorporating onlyproven technology with standard components. The study attemptsto perform a generalized and systematic evaluation of thethermodynamic advantages of various hybrid configurations withthe help of computer simulations, comparing the efficiencyresults to clearly defined reference values. Results show that the electrical efficiency of hybridconfigurations rises with up to 3 - 5 %-points in cold-condensingmode (up to 3 %-points in CHP mode), compared to the sum of twosingle-fuel reference units at the relevant scales, dependingon type of arrangement and type of bottoming fuel. Electricalefficiency of utilisation of the bottoming fuel (biomass orMSW) within the overall hybrid configuration can increase withup to 8 - 10 %-points, if all benefits from the thermalintegration are assigned to the bottoming cycle and effects ofscale on the reference electrical efficiency are accounted for. All fully-fired (<b>windbox)</b> configurations show advantages of upto 4 %-points in total efficiency in CHP mode with districtheating output, when flue gas condensation is applied. Theadvantages of parallel-powered configurations in terms of totalefficiency in CHP mode are only marginal.

The remaining coals used are from South Africa, Russia, Australia, and China. The challenges at the La Robla I Station stem from the various fuels used, the characteristics of which differ from the design coal. The University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) and the Lehigh University Energy Research Center (LUERC) undertook a program to assess problematic slagging and unburned carbon issues occurring at the plant. Full-scale combustion tests were performed under baseline conditions, with elevated oxygen level and with redistribution of air during a site visit at the plant. During these tests, operating information, observations and temperature measurements, and coal, slag deposit, and fly ash samples were obtained to assess slagging and unburned carbon. The slagging in almost all cases appeared due to elevated temperatures rather than fuel chemistry. The most severe slagging occurred when the temperature at the sampling port was in excess of 1500 C, with problematic slagging where first-observed temperatures exceeded 1350 C. The presence of anorthite crystals in the bulk of the deposits analyzed indicates that the temperatures were in excess of 1350 C, consistent with temperature measurements during the sampling period. Elevated temperatures and ''hot spots'' are probably the result of poor mill performance, and a poor distribution of the coal from the mills to the specific burners causes elevated temperatures in the regions where the slag samples were extracted. A contributing cause appeared to be poor combustion air mixing and heating, resulting in oxygen stratification and increased temperatures in certain areas. Air preheater plugging was observed and reduces the temperature of the air in the <b>windbox,</b> which leads to poor combustion conditions, resulting in unburned carbon as well as slagging. A second phase of the project involved advanced analysis of the baseline coal along with an Australian coal fired at the plant. These analysis results were used in equilibrium thermodynamic modeling along with a coal quality model developed by the EERC to assess slagging, fouling, and opacity for the coals. Bench-scale carbon conversion testing was performed in a drop-tube furnace to assess the reactivity of the coals. The Australian coal had a higher mineral content with significantly more clay minerals present than the baseline coal. The presence of these clay minerals, which tend to melt at relatively low temperatures, indicated a higher potential for problematic slagging than the baseline coal. However, the pyritic minerals, comprising over 25 % of the baseline mineral content, may form sticky iron sulfides, leading to severe slagging in the burner region if local areas with reducing conditions exist. Modeling results indicated that neither would present significant fouling problems. The Australian coal was expected to show slagging behavior much more severe than the baseline coal except at very high furnace temperatures. However, the baseline coal was predicted to exhibit opacity problems, as well as have a higher potential for problematic calcium sulfate-based low-temperature fouling. The baseline coal had a somewhat higher reactivity than the Australian coal, which was consistent with both the lower average activation energy for the baseline coal and the greater carbon conversion at a given temperature and residence time. The activation energy of the baseline coal showed some effect of oxygen on the activation energy, with E{sub a} increasing at the lower oxygen concentration, but {{may be due to the}} scatter in the baseline coal kinetic values at the higher oxygen level tested...|$|E

Department of Energy, the Gas Research Institute, Public Service Company of Colorado, Colorado Interstate Gas, Electric Power Research Institute, and the Energy and Environmental Research Corporation (EER). EER conducted a comprehensive test demonstration program over a wide range of boiler conditions. Over 4, 000 hours of operation were achieved. Intensive measurements were taken to quantify the reductions in NOX emissions, the impact on boiler equipment and operability, and all factors influencing costs. The results showed that GR-LNB technology achieved excellent emission reductions. Although the performance of the low NOX burners (supplied by others) was somewhat less than expected, a NOX reduction of 65 % was achieved at an average gas heat input of 180 A. The performance goal of 70 % reduction was met on many test runs, but at higher gas heat inputs. The impact on boiler equipment was determined to be very minimal. Toward the end of the testing, the flue gas recirculation (used to enhance gas penetration into the furnace) system was removed and new high pressure gas injectors were installed. Further, the low NOX burners were modified and gave better NO. reduction performance. These modifications resulted in a similar NO, reduction performance (64 %) at a reduced level of gas heat input (- 13 Yo). In addition, the OFA injectors were re-designed to provide for better control of CO emissions. Although not a part of this project, the use of natural gas as the primary fuel with gas reburning was also tested. The gas/gas reburning tests demonstrated a reduction in NOX emissions of 43 % (0. 30 lb/ 1 OG Btu reduced to 0. 17 lb/ 1 OG Btu) using 7 % gas heat input. Economics are a key issue affecting technology development. Application of GR-LNB requires modifications to existing power plant equipment and as a result, the capital and operating costs depend largely on site-specific factors such as: gas availability at the site, gas to coal delivered price differential, sulfur dioxide removal requirements, <b>windbox</b> pressure, existing burner throat diameters, and reburn zone residence time available. Based on the results of this CCT project, EER expects that most GR-LNB installations will achieve at least 60 % NOX control when firing 10 - 15 % gas. The capital cost estimate for installing a GR-LNB system on a 300 MW, unit is approximately $ 25 /kW. plus the cost of a gas pipeline (if required). Operating costs are almost entirely related to the differential cost of the natural gas compared to coal...|$|E
40|$|Using biomass for utility {{heat and}} {{electricity}} generation can supplement use of fossil fuels, whose {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide likely risk causing serious climate change and ocean acidification. Biomass as energy source is a limited resource and when used as fuel in thermal power plants this currently results in higher production costs than using fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. It is, therefore, important to find highly efficient and reliable biomass conversion technologies. Reliability is important to minimize investment risk. Co-firing biomass with coal is well known as a potential low cost and high efficient way of introducing biomass in the stationary energy system. Yet, several regions around Europe and elsewhere are strongly dependent on natural gas for electricity generation, typically applying combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. Although CO 2 emissions from natural gas is considerably lower than from coal fired plants, it is less known how to introduce biomass as fuel in natural gas fired plants than in coal. Therefore, the present thesis evaluates options for integration of thermal conversion of biomass with existing CCGT plants. The focus on existing gas fired plants is motivated by a) gas fired plants are becoming increasingly dominant in some regions and there should be sought integration options that are not only based on co-firing with coal, and b) if the existing power plant infrastructure can be used to introduce biomass this could facilitate a near term introduction of biomass, contributing to near term CO 2 mitigation targets, as opposed to building biomass-only dedicated plants. The biomass-based options for CCGT integration investigated in this work are hybrid combined cycles (HCC) and biomass gasification. A HCC is a combined cycle firing various fuels; in the present case natural gas in gas turbines (GTs) as topping cycle, and biomass in a fluidized bed boiler as bottoming (steam) cycle. HCC options include fully-fired (hot <b>windbox)</b> schemes with uncooled flue gases from GTs used as fluidization media in boiler, and supplementary fired schemes with GT flue gas used for preheating air and economizing. Gasification means thermal conversion of biomass to producer gas, that is cleaned and upgraded to medium-value syngas or high-value methane, which can be used in GT-based plants. The gasification schemes considered in this work also include minor steam cycles. The above options are compared to power (and heat) generation in commercial state-of-the-art fluidized bed boiler steam plants, as reference. All are applied to two basic case studies (three CCGT plant concepts, based on actual/typical plants) with varying gas plant sizes and configurations with different gas turbine types and steam data, as well as in condensing or combined heat and power schemes. The results show that increased thermal and cost efficiency can be attained by some of the proposed schemes for biomass/CCGT-integration. Integrated fully-fired hybrid schemes can give an increase of the specific biomass efficiency related to electricity production in the range 4 - 9 %-points, and for the gasification options up to 14 %-points, compared with a stand-alone state of the art biomass boiler, which has an electrical efficiency in the order of 35 %. Gasification schemes for methane were found to be less efficient for power (and heat) production than those for medium-value syngas. Parallel-powered hybrid schemes did not show thermodynamical benefits in the studied options. Levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) for integrated options was found to be in the range of, at most, 10 - 20 EUR/MWh lower than non-integrated options. The best cost performance was found for options with the highest efficiencies (gasification to medium value syngas, hybrid options at some conditions) or for those with simple design at conditions of high DH prices and/or low biomass fuel costs. Drying of biomass with CCGT low temperature exhaust gases was found to be cost-efficient. Obtaining modest efficiency increase by employing more advanced technology, such as some configurations of hybrid cycles, did not show significant cost benefits. The choice of most cost effective technology was found to mainly depend on district heating prices, whereas fuel costs and discount rates had less but still important influence. The overall conclusion of this work is that biomass integration with existing combined cycle natural gas-fired plants has the potential to lower costs and increase the competitiveness for biomass power compared with other low carbon alternatives (fossil power with carbon capture), although attributed with some risks and technical difficulties. Biomass integration in existing natural gas power plants can, therefore, be part of a pathway to increase employment and development of biomass thermal conversion technologies...|$|E
