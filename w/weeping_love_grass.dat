This study's objectives were to test the applicability of soybean and <b>weeping</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass</b> as companion plants for assisting Pinus patula establishment on former agricultural lands (oldlands), and their capacity for suppressing growth of weedy species. Two experimental trials were conducted which involved growing pine, soybean, <b>weeping</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass</b> {{and an assortment of}} weedy species in monocultures and mixtures in pots containing oldland and plantation soils. Pine height and stem diameter were measured at monthly intervals, with total biomass accumulation in all taxa determined 14 months after planting. In the presence of soybean, both shoot and root growth of pine seedlings were enhanced, but root growth was reduced in the presence of <b>weeping</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass.</b> In the presence of the weedy species assortment, pine stem diameter, height, shoot and root biomass were all decreased. In contrast, total biomass accumulation of both soybean and <b>weeping</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass</b> was unaffected by the presence of the weed species assortment. However, the total biomass of this assortment was reduced in the presence of these two species. It is concluded, that P. patula establishment on oldlands infested with agronomic weeds may be improved by cultivating this species together with soybean...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of a {{mulching}} sheet made of nonwoven fabric on the colonization of roots of <b>weeping</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass,</b> Eragrostis curvula (WLG), by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, both laboratory and field experiments were conducted. In the laboratory experiment, {{the effect of}} mulching on the growth of WLG was examined in combination with an AM fungal inoculum containing Gigaspora margarita and slow releasing chemical fertilizer under growth camber conditions. After 35 days, growth enhancement of WLG was the largest in the mulching sheet treatment together with the inoculum and the fertilizer. In the field experiment, the effect of the mulching sheet was also examined in combination with the inoculum of two different AM fungi by using concrete framed fields. Mulching enhanced both the growth of WLG and fungal colonization in the case of both inocula after a growth period of 95 days. These results supported our previous findings showing that the use of the mulching sheet increased the effect of AM fungal inoculum on the rehabilitation of degraded soils...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Environmental Science and Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Restoration and {{rehabilitation}} activities are presently {{considered to be}} a major priority in environmental management, whether the activity implies the restoration of neglected cultivated pastures or degraded rangelands due to overgrazing and climatic impacts, or the rehabilitation of the mining and industrial areas. However, the goals are not easily achieved, mainly due to the high input costs, including that of re-seeding activities. Reseeding success is influenced by the quality and effectiveness of the used seed regarding germination and establishment under natural field conditions. If techniques can be developed to enhance the effectiveness of germination and establishment percentage of the seed in restoration {{and rehabilitation}} sites, a better cover, density and biomass yield can be expected, which will improve the rehabilitation process. It is known that commercially available grass seed has a better germination percentage and establishment percentage in comparison with seed locally harvested, which may include many impurities such as sticks and stones. The availability of the locally harvested seed types, especially of certain ecotypes adapted to specific environments, can be poor. Advance Seed Company (Krugersdorp, South Africa) has taken commercially available grass seed to the next level by enhancing (coating) the seed with a multitude of different treatments to ensure better handling of the seed in reseeding applications. These treatments also have advantages such as a higher seed to soil contact, growth stimulants included in the treatment, higher seed purity and the protection of the seed against predation by ants and other insects and against harsh chemicals in the soil, which might have an influence on the germination percentage of the seed and the establishment of seedlings. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether or not certain enhanced grass seed types of selected grass species will have a better germination and establishment percentage, fresh and dry above-(leaves) and below-ground (root) biomass yield (glasshouse trials) and dry above-ground biomass yields (natural fields trials) in comparison with non-enhanced types. The predation of enhanced and non-enhanced seeds by ants and other insects, as well as the development of the vascular tissue in the transitional region of the seedlings was also investigated. The grasses assessed included enhanced and non-enhanced seed types of Chloris gayana (Rhodes grass), Cynodon dactylon (Couch grass), Digitaria eriantha (Common finger grass) and Eragrostis curvula (<b>Weeping</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass).</b> In the case of E. curvula, four seed types, including the non-enhanced seed type were tested. These included non-enhanced seed, seed treated with "plain coat", enhancement with "organic insecticide on the base of the coaf' (Le. insecticide between the enhancement and the seed) and enhancement with "organic insecticide on the base of the coat and as an overspray" (Le. insecticide between the enhancement and the seed, as well as spraying the insecticide over the coated seed). The above mentioned species are commonly used in grass seed mixtures for rehabilitation and restoration purposes. Seeds were supplied by Advance Seed Company. The seed enhancement treatments as well as the non-enhanced seed types were tested under various conditions. The chemical composition of the enhancement treatment used in the coating process is only known by the seed technicians at Advance Seed Company. All the seed supplied by the seed merchant had a purity of > 95 %. With the application of dormancy breaking in the germination tests the non-enhanced seed types of Chloris gayana had the higher germination percentage of the seed type or the same species. Other differences included the germination percentage being significantly higher for the enhanced seed type of Cynodon dactylon than the non-enhanced seed type. Lower germination percentages were noted in the comparison of the E. curvula seed types, were the non-enhanced seed type had a higher germination percentage in comparison with the enhanced seed types. In the germination tests without dormancy breaking being applied, these results differ. With regard to the establishment percentages, similar statistical differences were noted in both the Coco Peat Moss medium and the Hygromix growth medium. In the above-and below-ground biomass production trials in the glass house the only significant difference were noted in the biomass production of D. eriantha plants. In the case of the dry above-and below-ground biomass yield the plants of the non-enhanced seed types of D. eriantha yielded a significantly higher biomass in comparison with the plants harvested from the enhanced seed type of the same species. With regard to the natural field trials a few significant differences were noted. The results indicated that the enhanced seed types of Chloris gayana and Cynodon dactylon, the non-enhanced seed type of D. eriantha as well as the non-enhanced and "organic insecticide on base and as overspray" enhancement of E cUNula can be used in re-seeding restoration and rehabilitation practices. Eragrostis cUNula enhanced with "plain coat" is not recommended to be used for re-seeding in disturbed areas. Master...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the first edition of Grasses: Panicum to Danthonia in 1973, twenty additional taxa of grasses have been discovered in Illinois that are properly placed in this volume. In addition, numerous nomenclatural changes have occurred for plants already known from the state, and many distributional records have been added. This second edition updates the status of grasses in Illinois. Paul W. Nelson has provided illustrations for all of the additions. Because the nature of grass structures is generally so different from that of other flowering plants, a special terminology is applied to them. In his introduction, Robert H. Mohlenbrock cites these terms, with descriptions that make the identification of unknown specimens possible. Mohlenbrock’s division of the grass family into subfamilies and tribes is a major departure from the sequence usually found in most floristic works in North America. Synonyms that have been applied to species in the northeastern United States are given under each species.

40|$|Semi-arid rangelands in Kenya are an {{important}} source of forage for both domestic and wild animals. However, indigenous perennial grasses notably Cenchrus ciliaris (African foxtail grass), Eragrostis superba (Maasai <b>love</b> <b>grass)</b> and Enteropogon macrostachyus (Bush rye grass) are disappearing at an alarming rate. Efforts to re-introduce them through restoration programs have often yielded little success. This can partly be attributed to failure of topsoil to capture and store scarce water to meet germination and plant growth requirements. A study was undertaken in the semi-arid environment of eastern Kenya {{to determine the effects of}} land treatment on morphometric characteristics of E. superba, C. ciliaris and E. macrostachyus. Seed viability of the grasses was estimated by germination tests. Land treatments involved soil ripping using a tractor and hand-clearing. Thirty-five plants were randomly selected per sub-plot and tagged for sampling. Morphometric characteristics of the grass species were measured weekly. Aboveground biomass was estimated by harvesting standing biomass three months after establishment. Seed viability tests showed significant differences (p< 0. 05) among the three grass species. This was attributed to intrinsic properties of the grass seeds such as dormancy and tegumental hardness. Seedling survival, foliage cover, plant height, leaf and tiller numbers, and aboveground biomass were significantly higher in ripped plots than hand-cleared plots. It was concluded that soil disturbance influences plant morphometric characteristics and plays {{an important}} role in the success rate of restoration attempts in semi-arid rangelands...|$|R

Fighting land degradation is essential to ensure the sustainable and long-term productivity of the habited semiarid lands. In Kenya, grass reseeding technology has been used to combat land degradation. However, despite the use of locally adapted perennial grass species namely Cenchrus ciliaris (African foxtail grass), Eragrostis superba (Maasai <b>love</b> <b>grass)</b> and Enteropogon macrostachyus (Bush rye) failure still abound. Therefore, more land is still being degraded. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the main factors which contribute to failures in rehabilitating denuded patches in semi-arid lands of Kenya. A questionnaire was administered to capture farmer perceptions on failures on rangeland rehabilitation using grass reseeding technology. Rainfall data was collected during the study period. Moreover, rehabilitation trials using the three grasses were done under natural rainfall. Results from this study show that climatic factors mainly low amounts of rainfall to be the main contributor to rehabilitation failures. 92 % of the respondents asserted that reseeding fails because of low rainfall amounts received in the area. The study area received a total of 324 mm of rainfall which was low compared to the average annual mean of 600 mm. Reseeded trial plots also failed to establish due to the low amounts of rainfall received. This showed how low rainfall is unreliable for reseeding.

Cenchrus ciliaris (African foxtail grass), Enteropogon macrostachyus (bush rye) and Eragrostis superba (Maasai <b>love</b> <b>grass)</b> are important perennial grasses in the Eastern African semi-arid lands. A study was conducted to establish the contribution of these indigenous grasses in improving soil hydrological properties, rehabilitation, food security and the livelihoods of agro-pastoral communities in semi-arid districts of Kenya. Soil hydrological properties were tested using a Kamphorst simulator at different stubble heights to represent three different grazing intensities (low, medium, high). Ground cover was estimated using the step-point method. A survey was also conducted across 50 agro-pastoral households to establish the multidimensional benefits of the grasses. Sediment production (as a function of run-off and infiltration capacity) was significantly different (P< 0. 05) at different stubble heights. Ground cover estimates of the grasses were also significantly different (P< 0. 05). Cenchrus ciliaris had the greatest influence in improving soil hydrological properties. Enteropogon macrostachyus and E. superba were ranked second and third, respectively. Enteropogon macrostachyus had the greatest ground cover. Cenchrus ciliaris and E. superba were ranked second and third, respectively. These results were attributed to the growth and morphological characteristics of the grasses. Generally, an increase in stubble height increased infiltration capacity and reduced run-off and sediment production. Results from the household survey showed that the grasses provide a source of income through the sale of hay, grass seeds and milk, which also achieve a balanced diet. The grasses also provide a cheap source of thatching materials and livestock feed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Management of {{damaging}} invasive {{plants is}} often undertaken by multiple decision makers, each managing {{only a small}} part of the invader 2 ̆ 7 s population. As weeds can move between properties and re-infest eradicated sites from unmanaged sources, the dynamics of multiple decision makers plays a significant role in weed prevalence and invasion risk at the landscape scale. We used a spatially explicit agent-based simulation to determine how individual agent behavior, in concert with weed population ecology, determined weed prevalence. We compared two invasive grass species that differ in ecology, control methods, and costs: Nassella trichotoma (serrated tussock) and Eragrostis curvula (African <b>love</b> <b>grass).</b> The way decision makers reacted to the benefit of management had a large effect on the extent of a weed. If benefits of weed control outweighed the costs, and either net benefit was very large or all agents were very sensitive to net benefits, then agents tended to act synchronously, reducing the pool of infested agents available to spread the weed. As N. trichotoma was more damaging than E. curvula and had more effective control methods, agents chose to manage it more often, which resulted in lower prevalence of N. trichotoma. A relatively low number of agents who were intrinsically less motivated to control weeds led to increased prevalence of both species. This was particularly apparent when long-distance dispersal meant each infested agent increased the invasion risk for a large portion of the landscape. In this case, a small proportion of land mangers reluctant to control, regardless of costs and benefits, could lead to the whole landscape being infested, even when local control stopped new infestations. Social pressure was important, but only if it was independent of weed prevalence, suggesting that early access to information, and incentives to act on that information, may be crucial in stopping a weed from infesting large areas. The response of our model to both behavioral and ecological parameters was highly nonlinear. This implies that the outcomes of weed management programs that deal with multiple land mangers could be highly variable in both space and through time...|$|R
