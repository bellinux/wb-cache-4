5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving {{fingerprints}} on {{the letters and}} used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, {{but that he had}} made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is losing}} mass {{at a rate}} of 200kg/second. If mass loss at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss.|$|E
5|$|In these engagements it {{is claimed}} that a whole Ottoman {{battalion}} was captured or killed. Over 100 Ottoman soldiers were killed. Among the 172 prisoners were many wounded, while the British losses were under 60. It {{had been a}} crucial battle; if El Burj had been captured the British <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> {{the use of the}} road leading up from Berfilya, and the Beit Nuba–Beit Sira valley would have become untenable. The left flank of the infantry's main advance on Jerusalem would have been exposed, which would have also weakened the pressure being exerted towards the Nablus road.|$|E

A singles match was booked between Edge and Cena for the WWE title at Summerslam, with the stipulation that if Edge disqualified himself, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> the WWE title. At SummerSlam, Edge retained the title after he hit Cena {{with a pair of}} brass knuckles, this occurred when the referee was not looking.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus was a {{favorite}} of his great-uncle Augustus who for some time considered him heir to the Empire. In AD 4, persuaded by his wife Livia, Augustus decided in favor of Tiberius, his stepson from Livia's first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero. As a condition of Tiberius' own adoption by Augustus, Tiberius was to adopt Germanicus as a son and to name him as his heir. If Tiberius had not adopted Germanicus before his own adoption, and had Augustus adopted Tiberius first, then Tiberius <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> sui iuris, which included the legal authority to adopt. It was a corollary to the adoption, probably the next year, that Germanicus married his maternal second cousin, Agrippina the Elder.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision {{was that it would}} be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and whoever had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E

5|$|During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth {{was third}} {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry and have children of his own. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, when Winchester was {{no longer}} a safe {{location}} for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops {{were in the process of}} destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E
