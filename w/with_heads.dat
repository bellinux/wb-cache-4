5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those <b>with</b> <b>heads</b> are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{vestibular}} rotation testing <b>with</b> the <b>head</b> {{centered on}} the axis stimulates the semicircular canals evoking compensatory eye movements. If the head is placed forwards of the axis in an eccentric position the otoliths are also stimulated by a tangential linear acceleration acting laterally to the skull. In normal subjects the additional otolithic stimulus evokes compensatory eye movements with a higher gain than <b>with</b> <b>head</b> centred, particularly for high frequency (greater than 0. 1 Hz) stimuli. The responses <b>with</b> <b>head</b> centred and eccentric in various patients with known/suspected neuro-otological abnormalities have been compared. Patients with vestibular neurinectomies who have asymmetrical head centred responses showed greater asymmetry <b>with</b> <b>head</b> eccentric at higher stimulus frequencies. Some patients with cerebellar lesions showed abnormally enhanced or depressed and asymmetrical responses <b>with</b> <b>head</b> eccentric in comparison <b>with</b> <b>head</b> centred responses, which could be normal. The enhancing effects could be specific to low frequency stimuli. All patients who showed abnormal responses <b>with</b> <b>head</b> eccentric also had positional nystagmus provoked by the gravity acceleration vector when the head was tilted laterally. The direction of the positional nystagmus {{with respect to the}} gravity vector was not necessarily the same as the direction of the effect on eye movements of lateral acceleration during eccentric oscillation. Patients with benign paroxysmal vertigo or chronic linear vertigo in whom otolithic abnormalities are suspected were not found to have abnormal responses <b>with</b> <b>head</b> eccentric. We conclude that this method of testing may be useful in elucidating pathophysiology but is not a decisive clinical test for the presence of disordered otolith function...|$|R

Retrospective cohort and prospective cross-sectional studies METHODS: Forty-three pediatric subjects <b>with</b> <b>head</b> and neck vascular malformations evaluated at a tertiary-care multidisciplinary vascular anomalies center were included in a retrospective cohort study. Eighty-three consecutive pediatric subjects with vascular malformations evaluated at the same center {{were included in the}} prospective cross-sectional study. In the retrospective cohort study, 20 (47 %) subjects <b>with</b> <b>head</b> and neck malformations had documented SDB symptoms. Of those with SDB symptoms, five (25 %) required long-term tracheotomy. The children with SDB symptoms had greater vascular malformation size, more extensive pharyngeal involvement, greater vascular malformation mass effect on airway, and closer proximity of malformation to airway when compared to children without SDB symptoms. For the prospective cross-sectional study, 23 % of pediatric subjects had malformations of the head and neck. Those <b>with</b> <b>head</b> and neck malformations had a higher OSA- 18 score and a lower overall quality of life (QOL) score when compared to subjects with non-head and neck malformations. Nearly half of children <b>with</b> <b>head</b> and neck vascular malformations have SDB symptoms.

25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other <b>with</b> <b>heads</b> lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung.

Other core materials include compressed felt, cork, and leather, and other wrap materials include chamois. Unwrapped sticks <b>with</b> <b>heads</b> of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common. Wooden sticks are used as a special effect—specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era—and in authentic performances of Baroque music.|$|E

25|$|Of all {{the city}} gates and triumphal arches built during the Neoclassical period, {{the most famous}} and monumental is {{certainly}} the Arco della Pace. It was built during the Kingdom of Italy period {{at the end of}} the Corso Sempione road, the principal axis connecting the city to France under whose dependency the Kingdom came. Designed by Luigi Cagnola, construction began in 1805 only to be suspended a few years later. It was completed in 1816 at the instigation of Francis I of Austria. He called it the arch for European peace which had been achieved the previous year at the Congress of Vienna. The arch consists of three fornices with four giant order Corinthian columns. The entablature depicts allegories of the main rivers of the region, the Po, Ticino, Adige and Tagliamento, sculpted by Pompeo Marchesi. On top is a group of bronze sculptures from designs by Luigi Cagnola. The Chariot of Peace (Sestiga della Pace), representing Napoleon's victories, was originally designed to face the Corso Sempione but was later repositioned to overlook the city. Similarly, the arch's bas-reliefs were intended to depict Napoleon's exploits but when work began, under the influence of the Austrians, some of the scenes were changed to represent episodes from the Restoration and the Congress of Vienna while others depicting Napoleon were replaced <b>with</b> <b>heads</b> resembling Francis I. The customs offices on either side of the Arco della Pace date from 1838.|$|E
