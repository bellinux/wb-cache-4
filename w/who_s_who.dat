40|$|Karl Shell {{is without}} a doubt {{one of the central}} players in the {{development}} of economic theory and macroeconomics {{in the latter part of}} the twentieth century. He has made important contributions on topics ranging from growth theory, to overlapping generations, to extrinsic uncertainty, to monetary economics, to market games, and to technological innovation. His collaborations with Dave Cass are legend, and include the seminal formulation of the concept of sunspot equilibria. His Notes on the Economics of Infinity, and his papers with Yves Balasko are overlapping-generations classics. Shell s many coauthors read like a <b>Who</b> <b>s</b> <b>Who</b> in economics, and include (in no particular order) Joe Stiglitz, Franklin Fisher, Miguel Sidrauski, Ned Phelps, Duncan Foley, Walt Heller, Albert Ando, Jim Peck, Rod Garratt, Aditya Goenka, Christian Ghiglino, and Todd Keister. This is also a club to which we are also proud to belong. Shell s research is first rate and highly innovative, but his full contribution to economic theory must also be judged by his long service as the editor of one of the profession s premier journals, the Journal of Economic Theory. As the founding editor of JET, Shell took a small upstart journal, originally envisioned as a niche outlet for papers on mathematical economics, and turned it into one of the best in the profession. JET has published papers that have had major impacts on the development of economic theory in all its various flavors. Because of Shell s long stewardship of JET, the story of his professional life which we hope we have captured in this interview is also a history of the evolution of economic theory over the past quarter century. We spoke with Karl in his office at Cornell University and over lunch at the faculty club in the Statler, and the interview tapes we made were very much a three-way conversation between Karl and the two of us. In editing the transcripts of these tapes for publication, we wished to keep the focus of the conversation on Shell, and have therefore adopted the same anonymous MD moniker we used in our interview of Dave Cass to mask the identity of the questioner. We hope you enjoy the conversation as much as we did. ...|$|E

40|$|Ss {{asked to}} {{generate}} their own hypotheses expressed less {{confidence that they}} were true than did other <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> were presented with the same hypotheses for evaluation. This finding holds across domains varying from prediction and social inference to general knowledge questions. Furthermore, <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> generated their own hypotheses appeared {{to be more sensitive}} to their accuracy than were <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> evaluated the hypotheses. The results are interpreted as evidence that the hypothesis generation task leads Ss to consider more alternative hypotheses than <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> are asked to evaluate a prespecified hypothesis. This interpretation is supported by experiments demonstrating that the difference between generation and evaluation disappears if a closed set of alternatives is specified or if a delay is inserted between hypothesis generation and confidence assessment.

40|$|Summary. —A 4 -alternative forced-choice {{test was}} {{administered}} to 96 Ss. Ss task was to attempt to select the correct alternative from each test item and to indicate his degree of confidence in his choice on a 5 -point rating scale. The objective was to compare the confidence assignments of <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> did relatively well on the primary judgmental task with those of <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> did poorly. It was found that <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> performed poorly on the primary task (LP Ss) tended on the average to use lower confidence ratings than <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> did relatively well (HP Ss). Although few used either high or low ratings exclusively, all Ss tended to use {{one end of the}} confidence scale much more frequently than the other. How-ever, whereas HP Ss were fairly consistent in using {{the high end of the}} scale, LP Ss were about evenly divided between those using the high end and those using the low. For both groups, performance tended to be monotonically re-lated to expressed confidence. In terms of measures developed by Adams and Adams, HP Ss made more "realistic " confidence judgments than did LP Ss; however, there was no striking difference between groups in terms of differences in performance associated with step increases in expressed confidence. A positive monotonic relationship between expressed confidence and objec-tive performance measures has been obtained with a variety of judgmental task...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> {{typically}} fail {{to remember}} dreams at home (nonreporters) and <b>Ss</b> <b>who</b> frequently remember dreams (reporters) {{slept in the}} laboratory for 4 nights each. Gradual or abrupt awakenings were made at each EEG Stage- 1 REM (dream) period. Although nonreporters and reporters {{did not differ in}} REM-period frequency or EEG patterns during sleep, nonreporters did report dreaming less frequently following REM-period awakenings. Ss showed selfconsistency in frequency of dream reporting and in type of failure to report. Some nonreporters typically failed to remember any content; others typically said they were awake and thinking. Comparisons among reporters and subgroups of nonreporters for eye-movement frequency, arousal threshold, and dreamlike-report content indicate that it may be useful to distinguish different kinds of nonreporters. This study is {{one of a series of}} studies comparing subjects (<b>Ss)</b> <b>who</b> typically remember dreams with 5 <b>s</b> <b>who</b> claim that they rarely dream, in an effort to understand the basis for these individual differences in dream recall. These studies make use of the Aserinsky-Dement-Kleitman (Aserinsky & Kleitman, 1953; Dement & Kleitman, 1957 a, 19 S 7 b) EEG and eye-movement criteria for determining when dreams occur. They are based on the working assumption that awakening a 5 during a Stage- 1 EEG rapid eyemovement period (REM period) is awakening him while he is in a dream state. The first study in the series (Goodenough, Shapiro, Holden, & Steinschriber, 1959) was designed to test the accuracy of the claim made by some people that they rarely or never dream. A group of these 5 s (nonreporters) and a group of 5 <b>s</b> <b>who</b> claimed that they recalled dreams almost every night (dream reporters) were studied in the laboratory during their normal sleep period. The two groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of rapid eye-movement (REM) periods. When awakened from REM periods, every 5, including the nonreporters, relate...|$|R
