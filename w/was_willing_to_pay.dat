25|$|Many {{argue that}} Los Angeles paid an unfairly low price to the farmers of Owens Valley for their land. Gary Libecap of the University of California, Santa Barbara {{observed}} that the price that Los Angeles <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to other water sources per acre-foot of water was far higher than what the farmers received. Farmers who resisted the pressure from Los Angeles until 1930 received the highest price for their land; most farmers sold their land from 1905 to 1925, and received less than Los Angeles was actually willing to pay. However, the sale of their land brought the farmers substantially more income than if they had kept the land for farming and ranching. None of the sales were made under threat of eminent domain.|$|E

Moreover, O'Malley's proposal — to have the city acquire the property for several times as much as he had originally said he <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> — was rejected by both pro- and anti-Moses officials, newspapers, and the public as an unacceptable government subsidy of a private business enterprise.|$|E

Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when {{patients were}} asked if they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada and <b>pay</b> out-of-pocket <b>to</b> have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that they were unsure.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to estimate the potential demand for certified clams in Italy and to investigate the determinants of maximum amount that respondents <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for this product. Quantitative analysis was used based on 1, 067 face-to-face interviews collected in 3 Italian regions in the north bordering the Adriatic Sea (Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna) carried out during 2008. The consumers' willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> (WTP) is measured using a contingent valuation method. In order to estimate separately the determinants of the probability that respondents <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> and the maximum that they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> a generalization of Tobit model was adopted. The results indicate that consumers <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a premium price mainly to purchase better quality products.

Though the Burlington did not parallel the Great Northern or the Northern Pacific, it would give them a powerful railroad in the central West. Harriman was the first to approach the Burlington's aging chieftain, the irascible Charles Elliott Perkins. The price for control of the Burlington, as set by Perkins, was $200 a share, more than Harriman <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Hill, however, met the price, and control of the Burlington was divided equally at about 48.5percent each between the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific.|$|E

25|$|To {{assist the}} ships, 14 lighthouses were built at various navigational hazards along the river. Six of them besides Tarrytown remain, from Peter's Hook in Manhattan to Hudson–Athens south of Albany, {{between those two}} communities. The shoals a half-mile (1km) off Tarrytown and Ossining (then known as Sing Sing) on the east {{bank of the river}} at the {{southern}} end of Haverstraw Bay were particularly dangerous as mariners preferred to use that side. In 1847 a location for a light was identified at Teller's Point, the southern tip of Croton Point just north of Ossining, at the north end of the shoal. That land was then used as a vineyard and its owner asked a higher price than the government <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> The following year Congress appropriated $4,000 ($ in modern dollars) to acquire a different site near Tarrytown, at the end of Tarrytown Point, the peninsula created by the outflow of sediment from the Pocantico River. Steamboat captains consulted by the government suggested that the light should instead be located at Beekman's Point, two miles (3.2km) away. Its owner likewise asked $3,000, which would not have left enough money to build the actual lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} that case that {{illegally}} earned income was subject to income tax; Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. rejected {{the argument that the}} Fifth Amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income. The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided. Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was charged with income tax evasion, as well as with various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson had been aware of the deal all along and refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. On {{the second day of the}} trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for Capone.|$|E
