25|$|The Miami Herald {{reports that}} Abul Hashem's family didn't know <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> until 2004, when the Red Crescent {{informed}} {{them he was}} in Guantanamo.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's {{family did}} not know <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> until several months later when they {{received}} a letter from Marshall's cousin F. Lewis Marshall informing them that James K. Marshall died at Gettysburg. The family had heard conflicting reports, and hoped that he was a prisoner of war.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2010, {{just hours}} {{before the start of}} his tour in Eugene, Oregon, O'Brien {{announced}} that he would host a new show on cable station TBS. The show debuted on November 8, 2010, and airs Monday through Thursday beginning at 11:00pm ET/10:00pm CT. O'Brien's addition moved Lopez Tonight with George Lopez back one hour to midnight ET/11:00pm CT. Refusing at first to do to Lopez <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at NBC, O'Brien agreed to join the network after Lopez called to persuade him to come to TBS. In Canada, CTV would air the show and in Turkey, CNBC-e would air the show.|$|E

25|$|Patient G.D. was a {{white male}} born in 1940 {{who served in the}} Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E
500|$|Manekshaw was {{evacuated}} {{from the battlefield}} by Sher Singh, his orderly, who took him to an Australian surgeon from the medical team. The surgeon initially declined to treat Manekshaw, {{saying that he was}} badly wounded and his chances of survival were very low, but Singh forced him to treat Manekshaw. Meanwhile, Manekshaw regained consciousness, and when the surgeon asked <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he replied that he was [...] "kicked by a mule." [...] Impressed by Manekshaw's sense of humour, he treated him, and removed seven bullets from his lungs, liver, and kidneys. Much of his intestines were removed and stitched. Over Manekshaw's protests that he treat the other patients, the regimental medical officer, Captain G. M. Diwan, attended to him.|$|E
2500|$|The furious Count de Tour {{threatens to}} leave the [...] "accursed house and this accursed country" [...] in a fury (Selby had already {{been removed from the}} scene earlier on, with no {{explanation}} of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> It was presumed that he had been sent back to Europe after this scheme failed so miserably).|$|E
25|$|There was not {{information}} on <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> them specifically found.|$|R
60|$|LIEUTENANT (confidently). You'll {{change your}} tone, General, {{when you hear}} <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|R
60|$|To Bert {{it was no}} {{more than}} the end of a series of disagreeable sensations. He was not curious <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the airship, nor <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the battle. For a long time he lay waiting apprehensively for the {{pitching}} and tossing and his qualms to return, and so, lying, boxed up in the locker, he presently fell asleep.|$|R
2500|$|Selby {{is injured}} pretty badly, {{and while he}} is in his bed, Mrs. Warbucks screams at and demands that Oliver have more sympathy for Selby (during that time, he was gleefully {{whistling}} and humming the popular song, [...] "Yessir, That's My Baby" [...] in honor of Annie who had beat him up). It is clear that Warbucks believed that Selby brought <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on himself and that he got exactly as he deserved.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it took a}} {{few months}} for the realities of the Stalinist purges to become apparent, Martha Ruben-Wolf was forced to become aware {{of the extent to which}} friends were disappearing, notably after her husband was arrested by the {{security}} services on 28 November 1937 or 15 January 1938. [...] (Sources differ.) [...] Accused of being a Gestapo spy, on 4 October 1938 he was sentenced to death and shot. [...] It is not clear whether Martha ever learned of his fate. [...] She certainly devoted desperate energy, apparently without success, to trying to find out <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> after he disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} before his death, in a final statement, he {{declared}} that nobody among either his associates or the general public had understood <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> (as the conduit of the teaching). He added that the [...] "supreme intelligence" [...] operating in his body would be gone with his death, again implying the impossibility of successors. However, [...] he stated that people could perhaps get into touch with that somewhat [...] "if they live the teachings". In prior discussions, he had compared himself with Thomas Edison, implying that he did the hard work, and now all that was needed by others was a flick of the switch.|$|E

60|$|She {{wondered}} how Siegmund {{had passed the}} day, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> how he felt, how he looked. She thought of him protectively.|$|E
60|$|Thereupon he told Selim the Fisherman {{the story}} of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> with all its ins and outs, just as I have told it to you.|$|E
60|$|At last {{he began}} to {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{and while he was}} taking counsel with himself what had best be done, the raven came to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good God! <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> thee?" [...] cried George Warrington, presently, {{when his}} brother came in, looking ghastly pale.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your business, sir! <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Sir Gervaise?" [...] {{repeated}} Bluewater, {{shaking his}} long fore-finger menacingly, at the steward.|$|R
60|$|And <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Pike {{remains a}} mystery. For that matter, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the second mate? In {{the past three}} days we have by our eyes taken the census of the mutineers. Every man has been seen by us with the sole {{exception}} of Mr. Mellaire, or Sidney Waltham, as I assume I must correctly name him. He has not appeared--does not appear; and we can only speculate and conjecture.|$|R
60|$|Kells {{stared down}} at the gold. His jaw worked convulsively. He had the eyes of a trapped wolf. Yet he seemed not wholly to {{comprehend}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feared the}} rain that threatened," [...] said Little John in a sullen tone, {{for he was}} vexed at being so chaffed by Robin with <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|So Sir Launcelot {{was aware}} from {{these things that}} he was a {{prisoner}}--though not a prisoner in a hard case--and he wist not how he had come thither nor <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "But, grandmamma," [...] cried she vehemently, turning herself {{round as}} clearer {{recollection}} returned, [...] "something <b>has</b> happened--O! <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Fred?" ...|$|R
60|$|Having put {{the deer}} in the stable, the little folk began to wonder how they might rescue their master; and they {{realized}} they must discover, first of all, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and where he was.|$|E
60|$|But {{he shook}} my hand off with an irritated movement, {{and for a long}} time I stood by his side in silence. Maud was looking on, her face awed and frightened. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> we could not imagine.|$|E
60|$|Desmond related <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{from the}} time he left, and said that a large {{proportion}} of the troops at Diepenbeck had already left, and, as he heard no outburst of firing, he hoped most of them had got safely away.|$|E

50|$|That night, Gary {{proceeds}} alone {{out onto}} the island where he is bitten by a giant spider and turns into some type of spider-man beast. He flees into the woods, leaving the women <b>to</b> wonder <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him. The next day, seemingly possessed by uncontrollable violent urges, Gary kills one of the girls. The remaining women, still unaware of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him, <b>have</b> no idea {{that he is the}} one who has done this.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Murthwaite {{was not an}} easy man to astonish; {{but that}} last answer of mine {{completely}} staggered him.

[...] "It is clear that the Indian's parting inquiry had an object," [...] I added. [...] "Why should he be so anxious to know the time at which a borrower of money is usually privileged to pay the money back?" ...|$|R
