25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E
500|$|Christian Blauvelt from website Hollywood.com {{criticized the}} casting of Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness as being [...] "whitewashed into oblivion". [...] actor Garrett Wang tweeting, [...] "The casting of Cumberbatch {{was a mistake}} {{on the part of}} the producers. I am not being {{critical}} of the actor or his talent, just the casting." [...] Co-producer and co-screenwriter Roberto Orci addressed the issue of the casting saying, [...] "Basically, as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> casting process and we began honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that. One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within us, not some other race." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} also a {{deliberate}} effort to bring the series more back to reality, following the success of Moonraker in 1979. As co-writer Michael G. Wilson pointed out, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> path of Moonraker things would just get more outlandish, so {{we needed to get}} back to basics". To that end, the story that emerged was simpler, not one in which the world was at risk, but returning the series to that of a Cold War thriller; Bond would also rely more on his wits than gadgets to survive. Glen decided to symbolically represent it with a scene where Bond's Lotus blows itself up and forces 007 to rely on Melina's more humble Citroën 2CV. Since Ken Adam was busy with Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion of Glen, Lamont created realistic scenery, instead of the elaborate set pieces for which the series had been known.|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E
2500|$|Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Bradley Cooper {{were all}} casual acquaintances before The Hangover was filmed, which Helms said he {{believed}} helped in establishing a rapport and chemistry amongst their characters. Helms credited Phillips for [...] "bringing together three guys who are really different, but really appreciate each others' humor and sensibilities". Helms also said {{the fact that the}} story of the three characters growing closer and bonding informed the friendship between the three actors: [...] "As you spend 14hours a day together for three months, {{you see a lot of}} sides of somebody. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wringer together, and that shared experience really made us genuine buddies." ...|$|E

Although the film was not successful when first released theatrically, it generated more than $100 million from video rentals and became one of MGM's top 20 all-time bestsellers. Verhoeven accepted the film's unexpected cult status, saying [...] "Maybe this kind of ritualistic cult popularity isn't what I intended, but it's like a resurrection after the crucifixion." [...] Eszterhas, however, maintains that the humor was intentional: [...] "What Paul [...] and I had in mind was something darkly funny. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> script line by line, and we were really laughing at some of it. I defy people to tell me that a line like, 'How does it feel not to have anybody coming on you anymore' isn't meant to be funny." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we ask what societal, cultural, {{political}} and disciplinary purpose that Landsarbejdstjenesten (LAT) served {{and how the}} national socialist ideology expresses itself in the organisation. After having introduced the subject and {{the social and political}} situation that led to the rise of national socialism, <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> historiography and our methodological considerations during our gathering of source material. <b>We</b> then <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a brief explanation of national socialist ideology before {{we take a look at}} the political party Danmarks Nationalsocialistiske Arbejderparti (DNSAP), from which LAT was founded. We then introduce LAT and the german Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD) in order to take a closer look at their internal relations. After introducing LAT and RAD <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> role of anti-communism and anti-semitism in creating an enemy of the national socialist vision. From there <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> propaganda and recruitment campaigns of LAT and DNSAP.

In the end, we conclude that the national socialist ideology is an inseparable part of LAT, and that the main reason that we have not seen LAT make public displays of racism, is because of the lack of political support for DNSAP and national socialism in general...|$|R
