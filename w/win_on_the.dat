5|$|Gordon Strachan made an unpromising {{start as}} manager of Celtic {{in the summer of}} 2005, losing his first match in charge – a Champions League {{qualifier}} – 0–5 to Slovakian side Artmedia Bratislava, the club's worst ever European result at that time. Celtic did produce a fight-back in the second leg at Parkhead, but their 4–0 <b>win</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night was not enough to salvage the tie.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{start to}} their league campaign, with one defeat {{in their first}} 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, their chances of winning the title {{remained}} intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate {{game of the season}} all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior goal difference. A <b>win</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day against Derby County meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.|$|E

Television pundits Rodney Marsh and Mark Lawrenson both agreed relegation would be the obvious outcome. Ipswich {{surprised}} the doubters; they sustained a high league position and narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Champions League, when the team failed to <b>win</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last day of the season against Derby County. The fifth-place finish gained the club a UEFA Cup place and earned George Burley the title of FA Premier League Manager of the Year, an award that until 2010 had, in every other season, been given to the manager of the Premier League champions.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Kenny Dykstra and Ric Flair continued. As {{a reward}} for {{defeating}} Flair at New Year's Revolution, Coachman booked Dykstra in a match with Hardy for his WWE Intercontinental Championship.
