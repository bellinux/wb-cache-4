Specifically, we report on a demographic survey (N= 81) followed by a user experiment (N= 102) in order {{to answer the following}} research questions: (1) What are the important cues that contribute to information being perceived as credible? and (2) To what extent is such a quantification portable across different microblogging platforms? To answer the second question, we study two popular microblogs, Reddit and Twitter. Key results include that significant effects of individual factors can be isolated, are portable, and that metadata and image type elements <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> general, the <b>strongest</b> <b>influencing</b> factors <b>in</b> credibility assessments. Microblogs such as Twitter and Reddit are well established global sources of real-time news and information. As with all platforms that support user-provided content, they suffe...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a couple}} of factors that <b>influence</b> how <b>strong</b> or weak a force in the chart the {{ascendant}} may be. Firstly, it is generally believed that the closer towards the beginning of the sign the ascendant falls, the stronger it will be. This is because most of the first house will fall into that sign. If the ascendant falls late in a sign, most of the first house will fall into the following sign, and thus weaken the effect of the ascendant's power. In addition the ascendant is thought to <b>be</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> when the sun <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a weak position in the chart. For example, it is traditionally believed that the sun <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a weaker position when it is placed {{at the bottom of the}} chart, near the imum coeli or IC. This is because the sun was literally on the other side of the earth when the subject was born, hidden from view. The sun may also <b>be</b> weaker <b>in</b> influence if it <b>is</b> unaspected, <b>in</b> other words if it forms no strong aspects or connections to the other planets.|$|R

Therefore, the paper attempt {{is to examine}} the impact of agricultural credits disbursed by the cooperative banks on regional development of agricultural sector in Poland over 1997 - 2006. Sources of data include financial statements of the banks (1373 observations) providing credit-related information and sectoral background data for agriculture from Central Statistical Office of Poland. The levels of agricultural development were assessed using a nation-level and regional-level composite indicators constructed by the author by the use of factor analysis. Additionally, one-factor ANOVA, Pearson correlations and linear regression were applied. There was found, that the most prosperous agricultural regions include wielkopolskie, zachodniopomorskie and warminsko-mazurskie, the least prosperous malopolskie, podkarpackie, slaskie and swietokrzyskie voivodships. Results of econometric analysis suggest also that region of bank’s activity has statistically significant impact both on agricultural credit and agricultural development levels. In Poland as a whole, farm credits provided by cooperative banks stimulate development of agriculture but only in two of sixteen regions (voivodships) their impact was positive and statistically significant. The average farm size and agricultural employment were found to <b>be</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>in</b> <b>influencing</b> agricultural development. cooperative banks, agriculture, regional development, Agricultural Finance,...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} doping on quantum dot (QD) solar cells by analysing their behavior in terms of photovoltaic characteristic, external quantum efficiency, and photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. The analysis addresses the two most widespread methods for QD selective doping, namely modulation and direct doping, to gain a comprehensive device-level assessment {{of the impact of}} doping profile and density on the solar cell behavior. Devices are simulated using a physics-based model that accurately describes QD carrier dynamics within a semi-classical drift-diffusion-Poisson model. Different scenarios in terms of crystal quality <b>are</b> considered: <b>in</b> the high-quality material, close to radiative limit, large open circuit voltage recovery is predicted, due to the suppression of radiative recombination through QD ground state. In the defective material, significant photovoltage recovery is also attained owing to the suppression of both nonradiative and QD ground state radiative recombination. In both cases, PL emission from extended wetting layer states becomes dominant at high doping density. The interplay between nonradiative and QD radiative recombination channels, and how their interaction is modified by doping, <b>are</b> analyzed <b>in</b> detail. <b>Strong</b> <b>influence</b> on the cell behavior of unintentional background doping of interdot layers and markedly nonlinear behavior of open circuit PL with respect to excitation intensity are demonstrated.

Compared to Tc(x) of Y 123 the Tc(x) curves of YCa 123 are shifted to lower oxygen contents and the maximum transition temperature Tc,max decreases with increasing Ca content whereas in Nd 123 Tc(x) is shifted to higher oxygen contents and Tc,max is increased. According {{to the universal}} parabolic Tc(nh) behavior the differences in Tc(x) of Y 123, YCa 123 and Nd 123 can be ascribed to different hole concentrations nh in the CuO 2 planes caused by doping via changes in chemistry or structure. In order to study the influence of structural changes on Tc we examined the hydrostatic pressure effect dTc/dp (p up to 0. 6 GPa). In the underdoped region, at nh= 0. 11, the examined compounds show a peak <b>in</b> dTc/dp which <b>is</b> very pronounced for systems with well ordered CuO chains.

40|$|Background: In {{response}} to the shortage of nurses, the Kingdom of Bahrain continues to have high dependence on expatriate nurses to maintain the health services. Consistent with Bahrainization, the development and expansion of an indigenous nursing profession through {{increasing the number of}} Bahrainis working as nurses must be a health service priority. However, in attracting local candidates to study nursing, the public image of nursing in the Middle East continues to be of concern. The study aimed to identify factors that influence the high school students and their parents in Bahrain to choose the nursing profession as a future career. It also aimed to explore and test strategic interventions to promote nursing as a career in Bahrain. Methods: A mixed methods research approach was used incorporating quantitative and qualitative dimensions. The study sample included high school students, students’ parents, career guidance counselors and nursing students. A one-group pretest-posttest design was also used to introduce a nursing recruitment intervention to a group of high school students. SPSS was used to analyse quantitative data, while Colaizzi 2 ̆ 7 s (1978) methodology and Krueger’s (1994) framework were applied to analyse the qualitative data. Findings: The study reported that generally, high school students, parents, career guidance counselors and nursing students have positive perceptions about nursing. However, nursing {{does not seem to be}} an attractive career option. It is proposed that the public perceptions of Bahraini people about nursing may <b>be</b> grounded <b>in</b> <b>strong</b> cultural <b>influences</b> and any efforts to improve the enrolment and retention of Bahraini nurses should consider enhancing the social values of the nursing profession. Conclusion: This study is significant as it will place the perceptions and understanding of Bahraini people and culture in the centre of nursing promotion and recruitment. It will also be a new and insightful addition to the international literature. Some of the issues raised <b>in</b> the study <b>are</b> reflective of the core international literature; however there are fundamental issues particular to the Gulf region, which will require attention in a context of an overall nursing recruitment strategy for Arabic nursing. The recruitment model NURS-P. R. A. M. is new and is a uniquely Arabic creation. It is focused on recruitment to nursing in the region and in particular Bahrain.

40|$|The Laptev Sea is a Siberian {{shelf sea}} and rather {{important}} for the Siberian river-run off to the Arctic, {{as well as in}} its function as “ice-factory” with sea ice formation rates above the amount of melting during the summer months. This study therefore mainly deals with the special characteristics of that region during the winter. Especially the analysis of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration below ice coverage and within dirty sea ice on the Laptev Sea Shelf <b>is</b> <b>in</b> focus. For SPM concentration in water and sea ice, water and sea ice samples as well as optical backscatter measurements have been carried out during German-Russian TRANSDRIFT winter expeditions to the Laptev Sea in April/May 2008, March/April 2009 and March/April 2012. Water samples were correlated to optical backscatter measurements in order to find a standardized correlation for the conversion of the backscatter data into SPM concentration in the water column during winter ice coverage. Additional scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were carried out for two filtered water samples from different water depths and for filtered dirty sea ice samples {{in order to have a}} look on sediment properties which could give a hint on possible location of sea ice formation and sediment input processes. Based on the different correlations it was possible to demonstrate that, compared to summer, during ice coverage in winter separated correlations need to be made for the water column above 10 m water depth and below 10 m water depth. The reason therefore could <b>be</b> found <b>in</b> the <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> on the optical backscatter sensor by the algae bloom within the upper water layer below the sea ice in April and May. Especially the data of 2009 where no correlation could be made for the water layer above 10 m water depth demonstrated this influence. These findings were also supported by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements of the water sample filter in 2 m water depth of the TRANSDRIFT expedition in 2012 where microalgae, identified as chains of Amphiprora sp., were found. The pictures of the dirty sea ice filter gave clear hints on an ice formation within the nearshore area due to grain sizes of 5 - 10 μm, a typical suspended particulate matter grain size, as well as particles of up to 30 μm. These larger particles have to originate from the nearshore area with water depth of 5 - 10 m where currents are able to transport these grain sizes. The absence of grain sizes within the sand fraction is finally a clear hint for ice formation via frazil ice within the water column and not as anchor ice connected to the shelf...|$|R
