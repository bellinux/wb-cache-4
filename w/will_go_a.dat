25|$|Following {{the command}} of the judge, the handler will stand the dog and leave from heel position. The handler <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> {{distance}} of approximately 6 feet and the judge will perform a cursory exam, touching the head, shoulders and hips, and when completed the judge will instruct the handler to return. The handler {{will return to the}} dog, going around behind it, and return to heel position. A variation on this exercise is used in advanced classes called the stand for examination. At the end of the heeling pattern instead of ordering the team to halt the judge will order the handler to stand their dog. While moving the handler will give the command and the dog must immediately stop while the handler continues moving to a point about 10 feet away. The judge will then approach and perform a more thorough exam of the dog and at the completion of the exam the dog is instructed to return directly to heel position WITHOUT coming to a front.|$|E
500|$|The brigade was {{advancing}} in quarter column {{as directed}} by Methuen's orders. [...] The soldiers advanced packed as closely together as possible, with each ordered to grasp his neighbour {{to prevent the}} men losing {{contact with each other}} in the darkness. As first light approached, the storm abated and the Brigade was on course, but the delays put them [...] from the line of hills. Wauchope's guide, Major Benson of the Royal Artillery, suggested to Wauchope that it was no longer safe to continue in closed formation and that the Brigade should deploy. Wauchope replied [...] "... I'm afraid my men will lose direction. I think we <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> little further." [...] Still in quarter column, the Highlanders advanced further towards the unknown enemy lines, when an advancing British soldier tripped an alarm on the fence in front of the Boer trench.|$|E

2500|$|Both sides {{considered}} the judgment a victory. Vivid Entertainment founder and co-chairman Steven Hirsch {{said in a}} statement that he is pleased with the decision regarding the enforcement questions, but plans to appeal the part of the ruling that upholds the measure. He stated, [...] "We won most everything we sought to be determined unconstitutional with Measure B. We are, however, disappointed the Court found it necessary to rewrite a portion of the measure in order to salvage a small portion of the measure and refused, at this time, to accept the adult industry’s own regulations by imposing an unfunded mandate upon the county by AHF." [...] AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein stated, [...] "Today’s ruling that requiring condoms in porn is constitutional is just a tremendous, tremendous victory, one that <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> long way to safeguard the health and safety of those adult performers working in the industry." [...] Vivid filed an appeal.|$|E

His mother's last words to him were reported to be [...] "Mind you die like a Kelly." ...|$|E
