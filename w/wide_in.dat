5|$|Both teams {{started with}} attacking play, with Brazilian Marcelo's shot going <b>wide</b> <b>in</b> the third minute and German Sami Khedira's {{shot in the}} seventh minute being {{inadvertently}} blocked by his teammate Toni Kroos. In the 11th minute, the Germans scored from their first corner of the game. Thomas Müller escaped his marker, David Luiz, in the penalty box, and Toni Kroos's delivery found him wide open for a side-footed shot into the net. In the following minutes Brazil tried to respond but their attacks came to nothing; although Philipp Lahm needed to deliver a brilliant tackle to keep Marcelo from setting up a chance in the penalty box. Instead, in the 23rd minute, Germany scored again after Kroos and Müller combined to set up Miroslav Klose, who scored on the rebound after his initial shot was saved by goalkeeper Júlio César. It was Klose's 16th goal at a World Cup, passing the Brazilian Ronaldo as the all-time World Cup top scorer.|$|E
5|$|Bulldogs battled the Dayton Triangles in week five. The Bulldogs {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} quarter on a two-yard rushing {{touchdown}} by Pete Calac. But the Triangles came back in the second quarter, scoring twice: back Frank Bacon had a four-yard rushing touchdown, and end Dave Reese had a 50-yard receiving touchdown. Guyon scored a 22-yard rushing touchdown during the corner, but the extra point sailed <b>wide.</b> <b>In</b> the third quarter, the Triangles responded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by back Lou Partlow, but Dayton missed the extra point to make the score 20–14. Thorpe then came into the game, and kicked a 45-yard field goal to bring his team within three points. In the final minutes, Thorpe kicked another 35-yard field goal to tie it. The Triangles were the first team to score on the Bulldogs since the opening game of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet <b>wide</b> <b>in</b> this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To compare spatial inequalities in life {{expectancy}} (LE) in West Central Scotland (WCS) with nine other postindustrial European regions. Design A cross-sectional observational study. Setting WCS and nine other postindustrial regions across Europe. Participants Data for WCS and nine other comparably deindustrialised European regions were analysed. Male and female LEs at birth were obtained or {{calculated for the}} mid- 2000 s for 160 districts within selected regions. Districts were stratified into two groups: small (populations of between 141   000 and 185   000 people) and large (populations between 224   000 and 352   000). The range and IQR in LE were used to describe within-region disparities. Results In small districts, the male LE range was <b>widest</b> <b>in</b> WCS and Merseyside, while the IQR was <b>widest</b> <b>in</b> WCS and Northern Ireland. For women, the LE range was <b>widest</b> <b>in</b> WCS, though the IQR was <b>widest</b> <b>in</b> Northern Ireland and Merseyside. In large districts, the range and IQR <b>in</b> LE was <b>widest</b> <b>in</b> WCS and Wallonia for both sexes. Conclusions Subregional spatial inequalities in LE <b>in</b> WCS are <b>wide</b> compared with other postindustrial mainland European regions, especially for men. Future research could explore the contribution of economic, social and political factors in reducing these inequalities. </p...|$|R

5|$|In Q2, it was Hamilton {{who came}} out on top, exactly six-tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg. Verstappen was third fastest, ahead of Ricciardo in fifth. Kimi Räikkönen had to abandon his first fast lap after running <b>wide</b> <b>in</b> turn four, but later set a time good enough for fourth. Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel {{recorded}} just one timed lap, saving a set of tyres and was sixth. On his return to Toro Rosso, Kvyat was eliminated in 13th place, while teammate Sainz went through to Q3. Sergio Pérez advanced as well, demoting his teammate Hülkenberg into elimination in the process, who would line up eleventh on the grid. Joining him on the sidelines for Q3 were Jenson Button in twelfth, with Romain Grosjean, Kevin Magnussen and Esteban Gutiérrez lining up behind Kvyat.|$|E
5|$|In September 1859 local {{residents}} formed a {{committee for the}} construction of a pile bridge over the Murrumbidgee River. After the New South Wales Government refused to support this type of bridge the committee decided to finance it themselves. The bridge was completed in October 1862 and opened on 27 October at just over 91 metres long and 7 metres <b>wide.</b> <b>In</b> 1884 the New South Wales Government purchased the bridge and it was demolished in 1895. In 1895 a truss bridge called the Hampden Bridge, was built across the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga. The bridge served the Wagga Wagga community for over 100 years until 16 August 2006 when it was closed and fenced off to the public due to the bridge being declared a safety risk after one of the trusses failed. In 2014 the Hampden Bridge was demolished.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} career, {{he played in}} a variety of attacking positions. Although he usually {{operated}} inside the penalty area as a main striker or centre-forward, his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role, as an inside forward or second striker, or out <b>wide.</b> <b>In</b> his later career, he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pelé’s unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints in order to get past players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca. Another one of his signature moves was the paradinha, or little stop.|$|E
5|$|The hockey {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer perimeter edges {{are called the}} side line, the opposing shorter edges are referred toe back line and the portion of this between the goal posts {{is known as the}} goal line. The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the back line should measure 55.00m (60yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2m at the sidelines and 3m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres <b>wide.</b> <b>In</b> each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300mm square is attached to a post of height 1.201.50m.|$|E

5|$|The {{two species}} of Dermotherium were about {{as large as the}} Philippine colugo and larger than the Sunda colugo and {{differed}} from both in a number of characteristics of the dentition. Not enough is known of the skeleton of Dermotherium to assess whether the animal already possessed the gliding adaptations of living colugos. The two species are similar in size, but again differ in details of the dentition. In two specimens of D.chimaera, the length and width of the m2 are 5 and 4.3mm and 5.4 and 4.8mm respectively; this tooth is 5.4mm long and 4.9mm <b>wide</b> <b>in</b> the only known specimen of Dermotherium major. The Pakistani M2 of Dermotherium is 4.3mm long and 6mm wide, compared to 4.7 and 6.6mm in the only known M2 of D.chimaera from Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is <b>wide</b> <b>in</b> K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently <b>wide.</b> <b>In</b> these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E

5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} {{beside the}} barriers of the circuit on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into the pit lane {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to the pit lane on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to pass him. Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced <b>wide</b> <b>in</b> avoidance. Later on Alesi collided with Diniz and struck the barriers, having lost his car's two left wheels. The safety car was once again deployed as carbon fibre was scattered across the grass.|$|E
5|$|When Sodh was {{twenty-two years}} old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his {{hometown}} and was given the Pāli language monastic name Candasaro. Phra (phra meaning 'monk, venerable') Candasaro studied both under masters of the oral meditation tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced meditation every day, {{from the first day}} following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople to offer them food. This hardship led him to resolve that he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season (third year after monk's ordination), Phra Candasaro traveled far and <b>wide</b> <b>in</b> Thailand to study scriptures and meditation practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range of things, and was in the habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about meditation at eight centers, among which Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization meditation method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in meditation regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya meditation.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a minute}} of Chelsea kicking off the match, Le Saux was booked for a {{challenge}} on Lauren. Arsenal were awarded the first corner {{of the game in}} the eight minutes later, but nothing came out of it as Adams fouled Mario Melchiot in the penalty box. The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Chelsea adopted a tactic of narrowing the pitch and using little width, which sedated Arsenal's typically fluent football. Guðjohnsen tested the Arsenal defence by making dangerous runs, but one in the 12th minute was ruled as a foul. Arsenal's first chance came a minute later when Henry used his pace to run towards the Chelsea goal. He set up Sylvain Wiltord, whose shot was blocked by Desailly. Vieira struggled to match the energetic performance of his opponent Frank Lampard and in the 17th minute Vieira's careless pass was intercepted by the England midfielder. Lampard decided to take a shot, forcing a save from Seaman. Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. A ball over the top found Bergkamp in the Chelsea area, but he guided his header just <b>wide.</b> <b>In</b> the 26th minute Vieira was awarded the final's first yellow card for a foul on Guðjohnsen. A confrontation between Melchiot and Fredrik Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing to have a few words with the players. Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. As the match drew nearer to half-time, Arsenal started to find their rhythm and played their usual passing game. They created the best chance of the first half, when a cross from Wiltord found Lauren, who headed the ball just over the crossbar. Hasselbaink, largely ineffective as he was blighted with injury, combined with Guðjohnsen to split open the Arsenal defence, but the move was halted as Riley called offside.|$|E
