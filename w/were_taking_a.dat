5|$|Although later events, {{such as the}} Hillsborough {{disaster}} and the subsequent Taylor Report, vindicated this plan, Rangers <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> significant risk. The whole plan was estimated to cost £6 million, which no other club could have afforded {{in a short period}} of time. The development was funded by the Rangers football pools operation, which was the largest club-based scheme in Britain. The first phase of the plan, which began in 1978, was the removal of the east terracing and its replacement with the Copland Road stand. The same process was repeated on the west side of the ground a year later, with the two identical stands each holding 7,500 seats. The redevelopment was completed in 1981 with the replacement of the Centenary Stand by the 10,300 capacity Govan Stand.|$|E

25|$|In Sydney in 1990, while Midnight Oil <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> break, Hirst {{joined up}} with guitarist Andrew Dickson, drummer Dorland Bray of Do-Ré-Mi, guitarist Leszek Karski (Midnight Oil producer) and bass guitarist Rick Grossman of Hoodoo Gurus {{to form a}} side project called Ghostwriters. The name refers to the {{practice}} of ghostwriting, wherein famous writers contribute under assumed names in order to remain anonymous. Ghostwriters' line-ups – both live and in the studio – changed considerably through the years, with only founders Hirst and Grossman being mainstays. Between successive album releases Hirst and Grossman returned to active involvement with Oils and Gurus respectively. Ghostwriters have released Ghostwriters (1991), Second Skin (1996), Fibromoon (1999) and Political Animal (2007).|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, October 8, {{was a hot}} {{and sunny}} day on the island. At approximately, 11:00 a.m. local time, some Marines <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> break from official duties and resting at a beach-side campsite during a lull in the training. They thus did not have live ammunition in their rifles for training purposes, although a few commissioned officers and senior NCOs carried Beretta M9 sidearms loaded with live ammunition. Soon thereafter, the two gunmen began shooting at the Marines with Kalashnikov rifles, specifically targeting two Marines playing a makeshift game of baseball during a rest in the training. One nearby Marine became disgruntled after hearing the gunfire, mistaking it for that of his fellow Marines, but soon realized otherwise.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1936 four naval {{personnel}} from {{the crew of}} cruiser Izumo went ashore and <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> walk on Haining Road in the Shanghai International Settlement.

After that the three wounded men were brought into Shiseido Bookstore but Taminato, who had received piercing bullet wounds to his left arm and right breast, collapsed onto the floor when trying to lean on a bookshelf and died immediately.|$|E
25|$|An episode {{from the}} life of Krishna narrates of when he stole the {{garments}} of gopis when they were bathing in a pond near Vrindavan. Varuna, the sea-god, had forbidden nude bathing in rivers, ponds and other public places, but gopis often resorted to it. One day, to teach them a lesson, Krishna reached the bank of the pond where they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> bath and took away their garments and spread them on the branches of nearby kadamba tree. He himself climbed the tree and hid there behind a branch. After the gopis had bathed, they looked for their garments but found them missing. Suddenly their attention was drawn to the nearby kadamba tree by the stirring of its branches. When they looked up, they saw Krishna hiding there and their garments scattered all over the branches of the tree. Krishna insisted that they come out naked to receive their garments. This episode is portrayed in song, story, painting and artifacts, in the backdrop of the kadamba tree.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, Jung {{published}} Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (published in English in 1916 as Psychology of the Unconscious) {{making it}} clear that his views <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> direction quite different from those of Freud. To distinguish his system from psychoanalysis, Jung called it analytical psychology. Anticipating the final breakdown of the relationship between Freud and Jung, Ernest Jones initiated the formation of a secret Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical coherence and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and Hanns Sachs. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of psychoanalytic theory before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the Jarhbuch and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Zürich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.|$|E

[...] Martin debunked speculation that they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> break from touring by saying, [...] "This three-year break idea only came about because I said at a gig in Australia that we might not be back there for three years. That’s probably true, but that’s just how a world tour works. No chance are we taking a three-year break.” ...|$|E

500|$|Although the North Atlantic World {{dominated}} the global system before proto-globalization, a more [...] "multipolar global economy" [...] started taking form around the early 19th century, and capital was becoming highly mobile. By {{the end of}} the 19th century, British capital wealth was 17% overseas, and the level of capital invested overseas nearly doubled by 1913 to 33%. Germany invested one-fifth of their total domestic savings in 1880, and, like Britain, increased their wealth tremendously in the early 20th century. The net foreign investment of total domestic savings abroad was 35% in 1860, 47% in 1880, and 53% in the years prior to the Great War. Global investments <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> steady rise throughout societies, and those able to invest thrust more and more of their domestic savings into international investments.|$|E
