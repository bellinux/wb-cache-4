5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> had a specific legal right.|$|E

25|$|A {{standard}} elimination checks each player's {{status on}} <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> {{will continue to}} the following episode. In most formats, a computer shows a green screen to signify they are continuing or a red screen to show they have earned the lowest score. Poland used red and green feathers, and some versions have used an eye instead.|$|E
25|$|Since {{marriage}} is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to zina, or adultery.|$|E
25|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Sharpstown. District J {{was created}} to allow Hispanics to more easily elect representatives who cater to them. Robert Jara, a {{political}} consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Sharpstown and Gulfton were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is of Hispanic origin or not.

50|$|The {{eyes are}} {{often viewed as}} {{important}} features of facial expressions. Aspects such as blinking rate {{can be used to}} indicate whether or not a person is nervous <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is lying. Also, eye contact is considered an important aspect of interpersonal communication. However, there are cultural differences regarding the social propriety of maintaining eye contact or not.|$|R
25|$|Genealogical DNA {{tests have}} become {{popular due to}} the ease of testing at home and their {{usefulness}} in supplementing genealogical research. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty {{that he or she}} is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.|$|E
25|$|All {{criminal}} trials {{before the}} High Court are heard and disposed of before a single Judge of the High Court. When the Court {{is ready to}} commence a trial, the accused appears or is brought before the court. The charge is read and explained, and the accused is asked <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is guilty of the offence or claims to be tried. If the accused pleads guilty the plea is recorded, {{and he or she}} may be convicted on it and sentenced. If the accused refuses to or does not plead, or if he or she claims trial, the Court proceeds to try the case.|$|E
25|$|One's first {{impressions}} {{are affected by}} <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes {{first impressions}} more because the collective first impression tends to remain stable over time. Solo experiences tend to facilitate local processing, causing the viewer {{to take a more}} critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative first impressions than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are more likely to experience an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual viewers will like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if it is really the same quality.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the player}} {{confirms}} <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> can speak into the microphone, Professor Kawashima will describe the first puzzle.

2500|$|The Law of Return ( [...] , ḥok ha-shvūt) is an Israeli law, {{passed on}} 5 July 1950, which gives Jews {{the right to}} come and live in Israel and to gain Israeli citizenship.

50|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{criticism}} {{has been growing}} over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium, in which all of the traditional political parties have been involved. This phenomenon has been {{explained by the fact}} that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.|$|R
25|$|By {{presenting}} such a card, purchasers typically {{earn the}} right either to a discount {{on the current}} purchase, or to an allotment of points {{that they can use}} for future purchases. Hence the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff. Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its marketing research. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing medical prescription preparations, or for other membership privileges (e.g., access to a club lounge in airports, using a frequent-flyer card).|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the applicant pool is from the New England area. The selection process is composed of {{a comprehensive review of}} the applicant's high school transcript to determine <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has taken the most challenging courses, personal recommendations from teachers and guidance counselor, an essay, and extracurricular involvement. As of 2010, SAT/ACT scores are optional for applicants. The acceptance rate is 67%, and labeled [...] "selective" [...] by US News and World Report. The college's applicant pool is relatively small, around 3,500 students, and the retention rate of Saint Anselm students from freshman to sophomore year is 76%. The average accepted high school GPA is a 3.2 on a scale of 4.|$|E
500|$|Blue is {{the color}} of intellect, reason, illusion, logic, knowledge, manipulation, and trickery, as well as the {{classical}} elements of air and water. Blue's strengths include allowing a player to draw additional cards; permanently taking control of an opponent's cards; returning cards from the battlefield to their owner's hand; forcing cards to go directly from a player's deck to their graveyard; and negating spells before they are successfully cast. Blue's creatures tend to be weaker than those of the other colors, but commonly have abilities which make them difficult to block, [...] "" [...] being the most common evasive ability among Blue creatures. Blue's power of extra-sensory perception is represented by the ability [...] "", which allows the player to look at the top cards of his or her deck and choose <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will draw those cards the subsequent turns. Since Blue magic revolves around advancement and technology, it has the highest number of cards having beneficial interactions with artifacts. Blue's weaknesses include its inability to destroy spells already placed on the field, having them returned to the hand instead; the fixation of negating and delaying enemy actions, while itself lacking an aggressive plan; and the way it prolongs the game and victory, thus allowing the opponent a possibility for a sudden comeback.|$|E
60|$|Those shining stars {{made her}} yield. She whispered {{to them that}} they had claimed her--the West claimed her--Stewart claimed her forever, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> lived <b>or</b> died. <b>She</b> gave up to her love.

5000|$|Technical {{reports are}} written to provide readers with information, instructions, and {{analysis}} on tasks. Reports come in many forms. For example, a technical writer might evaluate {{a building that}} is for sale and produce a trip report that highlights his or her findings and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> believes the building should be purchased. Another writer {{who works for a}} non-profit company may publish an evaluation report that shows the findings of the company's research into air pollution.|$|R
50|$|In Act five, Volumnia, Virgilia, and Coriolanus' son go to Coriolanus and beg him to {{stop his}} attack. Volumnia is the most vocal of the party, and says that if he attacks Rome, there is no honor for them <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> win <b>or</b> lose. <b>She</b> convinces him {{to agree to a}} treaty between the Romans and Volscians, and bring peace to both countries. On her {{successful}} return, she is hailed by all as the savior of Rome.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{example is}} the use of actuarial models to assess the risk of sex offense recidivism. Actuarial models and {{associated}} tables, such as the MnSOST-R, Static-99, and SORAG, have been used since the late 1990s to determine the likelihood that a sex offender will re-offend and thus <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> should be institutionalized or set free [...]|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{advisable}} {{to judge a}} person’s political orientation simply by <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> owns property or how much property he or she owns [...] Rather, we should judge him or her mainly {{by his or her}} political awareness, moral integrity and performance, by how he or she has acquired the property, how it has been disposed of and used, and by his or her actual contribution to the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|A {{note about}} the Miranda warnings: [...] The {{text of the}} Fifth Amendment does not require that the police, before {{interrogating}} a suspect whom they have in custody, give him or her the now-famous Miranda warnings. [...] Nevertheless, the Court has held that these warnings are a necessary prophylactic device, and thus required by the Fifth Amendment by police who interrogate any criminal suspect in custody, regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is ultimately prosecuted in state or federal court.|$|E
2500|$|Since most claims {{revolved}} around MP's second homes in London, a panel {{was established to}} investigate all claims relating to the [...] "second homes" [...] allowance between 2004 and 2008. Headed by former civil servant Sir Thomas Legg, the panel published its findings on 12 October as MPs returned to Westminster following the summer recess. Each MP received a letter stating <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> {{would be required to}} repay any expenses claimed. Details of voluntary repayments by MPs amounting to almost £500,000 were also officially published.|$|R
50|$|In New South Wales, Australia, {{road rage}} is {{considered}} an extremely serious act. Any person who chases another motorist or shows intimidating and/or bullying towards another road user can be charged with predatory driving, a serious offence that can leave the culprit in jail for up to 5 years. Offenders can also be fined A$100,000 and disqualified from driving, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> intended to harm the victim physically. If the predatory driving results in a physical assault or harm, and/or the victim's car was intentionally damaged, penalties can be much more severe.|$|R
50|$|The {{power to}} grant pardons and reprieves in the United Kingdom {{is known as}} the Royal {{prerogative}} of mercy. It was traditionally in the absolute power of the monarch to pardon an individual for a crime, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> had been convicted, and thereby commute any penalty; the power was then delegated both to the judiciary and the Sovereign's ministers. Since the creation of legal rights of appeal, the Royal prerogative of mercy is no longer exercised by the person of the sovereign, or by the judiciary, but only by the government.|$|R
2500|$|While most {{languages}} {{do not use}} wholly logographic writing systems, many languages {{use some}} logograms. A good example of modern western logograms are the Hindu-Arabic numerals: everyone who uses those symbols understands what 1 means <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> calls it one, eins, uno, yi, ichi, ehad, ena, or jedan. Other western logograms include the ampersand &, used for and, the at sign @, used in many contexts for at, the percent sign % and the many signs representing units of currency ($, ¢, €, £, ¥ and so on.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Wong never {{discovered}} {{the name of}} the burned and crying baby, whether it was a boy or a girl, or <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> survived. The next morning, he took the film from his Leica camera to the offices of China Press, where he showed enlargements to Malcolm Rosholt, saying, [...] "Look at this one!" [...] Wong later wrote that the next morning's newspapers reported that some 1,800 people, mostly women and children, had been waiting at the railway station, and that the IJN aviators had likely mistaken them for a troop movement. The Shanghai papers said that fewer than 300 people survived the attack. In October, Life magazine reported about 200 dead.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the free rider {{knows that he}} or she cannot be {{excluded}} from the benefits of national defense, regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> contributes to it. There is also no way that these benefits can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people. The free rider would not voluntarily exert any extra effort, unless there is some inherent pleasure or material reward for doing so (for example, money paid by the government, as with an all-volunteer army or mercenaries). The free-riding problem is even more complicated than it was thought to be until recently. [...] Any time non-excludability results in failure to pay the true marginal value (often called the [...] "demand revelation problem"), it will also result in failure to generate proper income levels, since households will not give up valuable leisure if they cannot individually increment a good. [...] This implies that, for public goods without strong special interest support, under-provision is likely since benefit-cost analyses are being conducted at the wrong income levels, and all of the ungenerated income would have been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations.|$|E
