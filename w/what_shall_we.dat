500|$|The Protector's agrarian {{policy and}} proclamations were {{inspired}} {{by a group of}} intellectuals sometimes called [...] "the commonwealth men". These were highly critical of landlords and left many commoners with the impression that enclosures were unlawful. As one of England's major landowners, Dudley soon feared that this would lead to serious trouble and discreetly tried to warn Somerset. By the summer of 1549 there was widespread unrest or even rebellion all over England. The Marquess of Northampton had been unable to restore order in and around Norwich, so John Dudley was sent to get hold of Kett's Rebellion. Dudley offered Robert Kett a pardon on the condition that the peasant army disband at once. This was rejected and the next night Dudley stormed the rebel-held city with a small mercenary contingent and drove the rebels out after fierce street fighting; 49 prisoners he had immediately hanged. Two days later Kett, who had his main camp outside the city, confronted the royal army, resulting in a slaughter of over 2,000 peasants. In the following weeks Dudley conducted courts-martial which executed many rebels, perhaps up to 300. For the enraged and humiliated local gentry this was still not enough punishment, so Dudley warned them: [...] "Is there no place for pardon? ... <b>What</b> <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> then do? Shall we hold the plough ourselves, play the carters and labour the ground with our own hands?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After writing Rabbit Is Rich, Updike {{published}} The Witches of Eastwick (1984), {{a playful}} novel about witches living in Rhode Island. He {{described it as}} an attempt to [...] "make things right with my, <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> call them, feminist detractors". One of Updike's most popular novels, it was adapted as a film and included on Harold Bloom's list of canonical 20th-century literature (in The Western Canon). In 2008 Updike published The Widows of Eastwick, a return to the witches in their old age. It was his last published novel.|$|E
2500|$|Patchen's {{first book}} of poetry, Before the Brave, was {{published}} by Random House in 1936. [...] His earliest collections of poetry were his most political and led to his being championed, in the 1930s, as a [...] "proletariat poet". This description, which Patchen rejected, never stuck, since his work varied widely in subject, style and form. As his career progressed, he continued to push himself into more and more experimental styles and forms, developing, along with writers such as Langston Hughes and Kenneth Rexroth, {{what came to be}} known as jazz poetry. He also experimented with his childlike [...] "painted poems," [...] many of which were published posthumously in the 1984 collection <b>What</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>We</b> Do Without Us.|$|E

[...] "What?" [...] said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, [...] "leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it." [...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E

2500|$|Sickert's {{fascination with}} urban culture {{accounted}} for his acquisition of studios in working-class sections of London, first in Cumberland Market in the 1890s, then in Camden Town in 1905. The latter location provided {{an event that}} would secure Sickert's prominence in the realist movement in Britain. [...] On 11 September 1907, Emily Dimmock, a prostitute cheating on her partner, was murdered in her home at Agar Grove (then St Paul's Road), Camden. After sexual intercourse the man had slit her throat open while she was asleep, then left in the morning. The Camden Town murder became an ongoing source of prurient sensationalism in the press. For several years Sickert had already been painting lugubrious female nudes on beds, and continued to do so, deliberately challenging the conventional approach to life painting—"The modern flood of representations of vacuous images dignified {{by the name of}} 'the nude' represents an artistic and intellectual bankruptcy"—giving four of them, which included a male figure, the title, The Camden Town Murder, and causing a controversy which ensured attention for his work. These paintings do not show violence, however, but a sad thoughtfulness, {{explained by the fact that}} three of them were originally exhibited with completely different titles, one more appropriately being <b>What</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>We</b> Do for the Rent?, and the first in the series, Summer Afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|So it was, on {{the next}} morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The {{children}} of Israel said, [...] "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did {{not come up with}} the assembly to the Lord?" [...] For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, [...] "He shall surely be put to death." [...] And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, [...] "One tribe is cut off from Israel today. <b>What</b> <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?" [...] And they said, [...] "What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?" [...] And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there. So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, [...] "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately." [...] So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them. And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel.|$|E
