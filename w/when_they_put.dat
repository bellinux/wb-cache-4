5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events of Jason Goes to Hell. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> on his mask.|$|E

The Muslim Brotherhood contradicted their initial position on 31 March 2012 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> forward Khairat El-Shater as the Brotherhood's candidate and Mohamed Morsi as his replacement. Aboul Fotouh {{is well known for}} his staunch opposition to both the Sadat and Mubarak regimes, as well as his openness towards people of different political views.

[...] In the 1987–88 NFL playoffs, although had only one previous start in his two-year career, he started for the Bears in place of five-year veteran Mike Richardson at left cornerback against the Redskins in their January 10, 1988 Divisional playoff game.

500|$|For the {{coronation}} {{of their parents}} in 1937, {{it was decided that}} Elizabeth and Margaret should be given small versions of crowns to wear at the ceremony. Ornate coronets of gold lined with crimson and edged with ermine were designed by Garrard & Co. and brought to the royal couple for inspection. However, the king and queen decided they were inappropriately elaborate and too heavy for the young princesses. Queen Mary suggested the coronets be silver-gilt in a medieval style with no decorations. George VI agreed, and the coronets were designed with Maltese crosses and fleurs-de-lis. After {{the coronation}}, Mary wrote: [...] "I sat between Maud and Lilibet (Elizabeth), and Margaret came next. They looked too sweet in their lace dresses and robes, especially <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> on their coronets". Both coronets are thought to be in the Queen's private collection.|$|E
500|$|Nhung {{was best}} known {{for his role in the}} November 1963 coup d'état led by Minh that ousted President Ngô Đình Diệm from office. At the end of the coup, Nhung - having shot Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the loyalist {{commander}} of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces at a grave at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base the day before - executed Diệm and his brother Ngô Đình Nhu. An investigation led by General Trần Văn Đôn, another coup plotter, determined that Nhung had repeatedly stabbed and shot the Ngô brothers while escorting them back to military headquarters after having arrested them. In a 1994 interview, [...] recalled, [...] "Nhu (Diem's brother) was alive <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> the knife in to take out some of the organs.....the gallbladder.

500|$|Hamels {{is known}} {{throughout}} baseball for possessing {{one of the}} better changeups in the game. In 2012, Fangraphs ranked Hamels as having the fourth best changeup in the game trailing only Jason Vargas, Tommy Milone, and Félix Hernández. The Hardball Times called his changeup a [...] "killer" [...] pitch to right-handed hitters, noting that while it is also effective against left-handed hitters, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> it in play, they generally have success. Rangers pitching coach Mike Maddux said of Hamels, [...] The development of Hamels' changeup is attributed by his high school pitching coach, Mark Furtak, to the fact that in high school he broke his arm. He could no longer work on his curveball for several months, and was forced to focus on the changeup. Chipper Jones, who was a star-third baseman for the rival Atlanta Braves commented that Hamels is the [...] "best lefthander in the National League ... you have to respect his fastball, and his change-up is devastating. If you're guessing fastball and you get change-up, you're way out in front of it. His change-up is a soft sinker that just falls down." [...] Aside from the changeup, he throws a four-seam fastball in the low 90s (can reach [...] ), a cutter , and an [...] "inconsistent" [...] curveball that sometimes loops and other times is sharp, and hovers in the mid-70s (around [...] ). Prior to the conception and advent of his cutter, he briefly threw a two-seam fastball around 2008 and 2009, before debuting his cutter in 2010.
