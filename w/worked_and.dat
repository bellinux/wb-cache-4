5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move <b>worked</b> <b>and</b> he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E

40|$|Our {{conceptual}} {{paradigm of}} <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family has shifted {{in the past}} decade from one that viewed managing <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family as a challenge to a contemporary view that we are facing a ‘collision’ (Pocock, 2003) between <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family. This review of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family research begins to explore the shifting conceptualisations, outlining demographic developments before examining key research themes of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family balance, <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family conflict, and flexibility as a potential means of achieving <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family balance. Changing work patterns in Australia, such as casualisation, working longer hours and non-standard hours, are investigated as potential contributors to a <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family collision and the pattern to downshifting explored as one strategy adopted by families to attain the best fit between <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family and avoid a collision. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{conceptual}} framework for the intersection of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles based on the constructs of <b>work</b> involvement <b>and</b> family involvement. The theoretical and empirical literature on the intersection of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles is reviewed from two analytical approaches. From the individual level of analysis, the literature reviewed reveals three theoretical models which assert: (1) that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family are separate role environments (segmented); (2) that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles are antithetical (compensatory); or (3) that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles are fundamentally similar (spillover). Literature from the couple's level of analysis is then reviewed which presents evidence {{for the existence of}} an inter-spouse relationship.

40|$|In many {{contemporary}} families, both parents {{are involved in}} paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family responsibilities. This creates challenges for the successful reconciliation of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family. In this study, we examined whether and how the division of paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work</b> between partners is related to work–family interference. Analyses were based on survey data of 147 Finnish, 186 German, and 265 Dutch dual-earner couples with young children and {{show that there is}} no recipe for a division of paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work</b> that guarantees a conflict-free reconciliation of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family. Although some cultural variation was identified, in general, individual time spent on paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work</b> appeared to be more decisive for parents’ level of work–family interference than couples’ combination strategies. Therefore, to help working parents it seems important to create opportunities to adjust their time spent on paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work.</b> <br/...|$|R

The work-family interface has  received little attention in teacher stress research, therefore the present study aimed to investigate <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress among teachers. Self-report questionnaires were distributed to 102 female, primary teachers from government schools in the Geelong area. Responses were used to: (a) identify the major <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stressors; (b) identify the contributions of perceived <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress to perceived global stress; and (c) explore the impact that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress have on each other. Overall the teachers reported moderate levels of global, <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress.
