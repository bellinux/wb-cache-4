40|$|Abstract — During ashing process, resist {{has been}} {{intuitively}} {{regarded as a}} protection layer and deliberately removed in previous studies by wet process prior to plasma exposure {{in an effort to}} amplify the damage effect.

40|$|Despite {{the use of}} hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) in {{clinical}} therapy for over half a century, the mechanisms that regulate HSC trafficking, engraftment, and life-long persistence after transplantation are unclear.

Surprisingly, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that <b>instead</b> of acting as barriers to cellular entry, vascular endothelial cells, via the guidance molecule ROBO 4, actively promote HSC translocation across vessel walls into the BM space. In contrast, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that the vasculature inhibits the reverse process, as induced vascular permeability led to a rapid increase in HSCs in the blood stream. Thus, the vascular endothelium reinforces HSC localization to BM niches both by promoting HSC extravasation from blood-to-BM and by forming vascular barriers that prevent BM-to-blood escape. Our results uncouple the mechanisms that regulate the directionality of HSC trafficking and show that the vasculature can be targeted to improve hematopoietic transplantation therapies...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) is reoriented {{between the}} nucleus and {{the leading edge}} in many {{migrating}} cells and contributes to directional migration. Models suggest that the MTOC is moved to its position during reorientation. By direct imaging of wound-edge fibroblasts after triggering MTOC reorientation with soluble factors, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>instead</b> that the nucleus {{moved away from the}} leading edge to reorient the MTOC, while the MTOC remained stationary. Rearward nuclear movement was coupled with actin retrograde flow and was regulated by a pathway involving Cdc 42, MRCK, myosin, and actin. Nuclear movement was unaffected by the inhibition of dynein, Par 6, or PKCζ, yet these components were essential for MTOC reorientation, as they maintained the MTOC at the cell centroid. These results show that nuclear repositioning is an initial polarizing event in migrating cells and that the positions of the nucleus and the MTOC are established by separate regulatory pathways...|$|E

40|$|Efficient iron {{acquisition}} {{is crucial}} for the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterial iron uptake and metabolism are therefore attractive targets for antitubercular drug development. Resistance mutations against a novel pyrazolopyrimidinone compound (PZP) that is active against M. tuberculosis have been identified within the gene cluster encoding the ESX- 3 type VII secretion system. ESX- 3 is required for mycobacterial iron acquisition through the mycobactin siderophore pathway, which could indicate that PZP restricts mycobacterial growth by targeting ESX- 3 and thus iron uptake. Surprisingly, we show that ESX- 3 is not the cellular target of the compound. We demonstrate that PZP indeed targets iron metabolism; however, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that <b>instead</b> of inhibiting uptake of iron, PZP acts as an iron chelator, and we present evidence that the compound restricts mycobacterial growth by chelating intrabacterial iron.

Materials and Methods: We report {{a case of}} a male, 55 years–old patient subjected to abdominal CT scan for hematuria, with relief of right adrenal lesion. During our following labora- tory and instrumental study, there resulted only a right pulmonary densification (“ground-glass areas”). At preoperative chest X-ray, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>instead</b> an opacity suspected for pulmonary neoplasy; so we carried out new chest CT, that confirmed it. However we per- formed a right VLS adrenalectomy for an histological definition and a next therapeutic strategy; meanwhile, the patient under- went to further chest CT (unchanged) and WB-PET (pulmonary superabsorber lesion with SUV> 8). Histological examination of the adrenal lesion resulted positive for adenoma and, after mul- tidisciplinary consulting, suspecting a round atelectasis, we tried antibiotic and steroid therapy. Results: After therapy, the chest CT showed only apical fibrous streaks. Conclusions: Up to 7 % of all patients over 60 may harbour a benign growth, often of the adrenal gland, which is detected when diagnostic imaging is used for the analysis of unrelated symptoms.

40|$|One of {{the classic}} {{questions}} about human thinking concerns the limited ability to perform two cognitive tasks concurrently, such as a novice driver’s difficulty in simultaneously driving and conversing. Limitations on the concurrent performance of two unrelated tasks challenge the tacitly assumed independence of two brain systems that seemingly have little overlap. The current study used fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure cortical activation during the concurrent performance of two high-level cognitive tasks that involve different sensory modalities and activate largely nonoverlapping areas of sensory and association cortex. One task was auditory sentence comprehension, {{and the other was}} the mental rotation of visually depicted 3 -D objects. If the neural systems underlying the two tasks functioned independently, then in the dual task the brain activation in the main areas supporting the cognitive processing should be approximately the conjunction of the activation for each of the two tasks performed alone. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>instead</b> that in the dual task, the activation in association areas (primarily temporal and parietal areas of cortex) was substantially less than the sum of the activation when the two tasks were performed alone, suggesting some mutual constraint among association areas.

Moreover, viewed through the lens of different life-course stages, we uncovered a strong foreign-born health advantage in adulthood but less so during the perinatal period, childhood/adolescence, and late life. Immigrant selection may be less relevant for the very young and very old, and of course we should thus not expect the presence of a healthy immigrant effect for these groups if that is the case.

40|$|Background: Mouse {{models of}} dysferlinopathies are {{valuable}} tools {{with which to}} investigate the pathomechanisms underlying these diseases and to test novel therapeutic strategies. One such mouse model is the Dysftm 1 Kcam strain, which was generated using a targeting vector to replace a 12 -kb region of the dysferlin gene and which features a progressive muscular dystrophy. A prerequisite for successful animal studies using genetic mouse models is an accurate genotyping protocol. Unfortunately, the lack of robustness of currently available genotyping protocols for the Dysftm 1 Kcam mouse has prevented efficient colony management. Initial attempts to improve the genotyping protocol based on the published genomic structure failed. These difficulties led us to analyze the targeted locus of the dysferlin gene of the Dysftm 1 Kcam mouse in greater detail. Methods: In this study we resequenced and analyzed the targeted locus of the Dysftm 1 Kcam mouse and developed a novel PCR protocol for genotyping. Results: <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that <b>instead</b> of a deletion, the dysferlin locus in the Dysftm 1 Kcam mouse carries a targeted insertion. This genetic characterization enabled us to establish a reliable method for genotyping of the Dysftm 1 Kcam mouse, and thus has made efficient colony management possible. Conclusion: Our work will make the Dysftm 1 Kcam mouse model more attractive for animal studies of dysferlinopathies...|$|R
6000|$|They looked {{carefully}} {{round with}} the torches. [...] "This carries out our idea, Dias, {{that the people}} upstairs died of hunger. I have no doubt, as you say, that the sacks did contain grain. If these had been cleared in the ordinary way there would certainly remain a good deal loosely scattered about. They might have been full or half-full {{at the time the}} place was left as <b>we</b> <b>found</b> it. Possibly, <b>instead</b> of ten men, the garrison may have been ten times as strong at first, but in the fifty or hundred years before the last survivors died they may have dwindled to a tenth of that number. However, it is plain that, as you say, the store of food was not carried away, but was consumed to the last grain. In the same way you can see, by the way the sacks and bags are tumbled about and turned inside out, how careful was the search for any remnant that might have been overlooked when they were first emptied. It all points to starvation." ...|$|R
