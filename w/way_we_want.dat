500|$|Vazgen Sargsyan's other brother, Armen, {{supported}} Serzh Sargsyan in the 2013 presidential election. On 5 March 2013, Aram Sargsyan {{was asked}} about his brother's political stance, to which he responded, [...] "I {{would very much like}} to ask Vazgen that question. I don't know what he would have answered. I don't know Vazgen's answers to very few questions. Unfortunately, our friends and relatives are not always the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them to be. I am not the first one, neither am I the last one; {{the history of the world}} is full of such examples starting from the Bible." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, Pekka had {{recorded}} vocals for five tracks, which Antti described as [...] "very raw ... the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them to be". Pekka's vocals {{would continue to be}} recorded in August, and he completed them on August 20. Antti had also completed his guitar solos by June and was pleased with the results. [...] "For me, the solos are [...] best that I have ever managed to create, and I'm very satisfied." [...] After a summer break, the band returned to record Sneck's keyboards, which took place over three days, August 17–19. Sneck worked with software effects for the first time, along with sound modules. He introduced synthesized horns to the band's instrumentation, but an actual trumpet was used for the intro to [...] "Rust Never Sleeps".|$|E
2500|$|Of its potential, Hau said [...] "While {{the matter}} is {{traveling}} between the two Bose–Einstein condensates, we can trap it, potentially for minutes, and reshape it – change it – in whatever <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want.</b> This novel form of quantum control could also have applications in the developing fields of quantum information processing and quantum cryptography." [...] Of the developmental implications, “This feat, the sharing around of quantum information in light-form and in not just one but two atom-forms, offers great encouragement to those who hope to develop quantum computers,” said Jeremy Bloxham, dean of science in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Hau was awarded the George Ledlie Prize for this work, Harvard's Provost Steven Hyman noting “her work is path-breaking. Her research blurs the boundaries between basic and applied science, draws on the talent and people of two Schools and several departments, and provides a literally glowing example of how taking daring intellectual risks leads to profound rewards.” ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Everything went perfectly, {{starting}} {{with all the}} speed up front," [...] said Curlin's jockey Robby Albarado. [...] "It unfolded just the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted,</b> but it also takes {{a hell of a}} horse to get this done. Curlin was there for us every step of the way." ...|$|R
50|$|Normally {{we start}} with a riff from Joe, and then we add drums {{sometimes}} with a machine, then I start writing lyrics, then we all start jamming on the song. It took us about one year to make so we could make sure it sounded the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to sound. Actually, we’re already writing a new record (laughs).|$|R
6000|$|... “That is {{just what}} I say,” said Dave. “Those skate marks lead down the river {{and that is the}} <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go. By {{following}} them we’ll be getting nearer to the Hall {{and at the same time}} closer to the fellows who took our things.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} see about that presently. I don't think we shall be able to lay our course beyond the Whittaker. To lay our course means to steer the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go; and if we can't do that we shall have to beat, and that is tedious work with a light wind like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't speak Dutch," [...] said Rollo to the boatman, [...] "but {{that is the}} <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go." [...] So saying, Rollo {{pointed in}} the {{direction}} which led towards the station. The man did not understand a word that Rollo had said; but still, by hearing it, he learned the fact that Rollo did not speak {{the language of the}} country, and by his signs he knew that he must go the way that he pointed. So he began to row the boat along.|$|E
5000|$|... "We were {{a little}} uncomfortable at first about using {{slightly}} older material, and I think if we'd done the album as a 4 piece, we wouldn't have used them. Having Dan join the band really revived those songs though, the arrangements have been bettered. We can now obviously do the songs justice with Dan's voice, they now sound the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> them to sound before, and <b>we</b> definitely <b>want</b> more people to hear them!" ...|$|R
500|$|No {{band that}} signed with Mr. Lady {{contained}} a male artist. Carland said [...] "It's not that we're necessarily {{never going to}} put out a band with men in it, but it's just kind of organically happened that <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> to focus on putting out music by women. We do consider ourselves a feminist business and part of that involves prioritizing work made by women." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're going {{just the}} <b>way</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> to go," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "and I guess {{the best thing}} we can do is to get to land before we're carried any farther." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In a few minutes, a lift {{will bring}} {{something}} {{down to us}} from the surface," [...] he explained. [...] "You see, Taylor, {{every once in a while}} Security examines and interrogates a surface leady, one that has been above for a time, to find out certain things. A vidcall is sent up and contact is made with a field headquarters. We need this direct interview; we can't depend on vidscreen contact alone. The leadys are doing a good job, but we want to make certain that everything is going the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The moon will be down in {{a couple}} of hours," [...] Ned said; [...] "but by that time we shall be beyond where any sentries are likely to have been placed on the road, so we can then trust {{ourselves}} on that till it begins to get daylight. We must keep in the fields till we are past Nussara, which is five miles by the road; then we can walk straight on. There is a nullah a few yards on; we had better keep in that for a quarter of a mile; it does not go quite the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> but it will be safer to follow it till we are well out of sight of any one who may be watching the plain." ...|$|E
60|$|Let us be frank; {{a form of}} Socialism might conceivably {{exist without}} much freedom, with hardly more freedom {{than that of a}} British worker to-day. A State Socialism tyrannized over by {{officials}} who might be almost as bad at times as uncontrolled small employers, is so far possible that in Germany it is practically half-existent now. A bureaucratic Socialism might conceivably be a state of affairs scarcely less detestable than our own. I will not deny there is a clear necessity of certain addenda to the wider formulæ of Socialism if we are to be safeguarded effectually from the official. We need free speech, free discussion, free publication, as essentials for a wholesome Socialist State. How they may be maintained I shall discuss in a later chapter. But these admissions do not justify the present system. Socialism, though it failed to give us freedom, would not destroy anything that we have in this <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> <b>want</b> freedom now, and we have it not. We speak of freedom of speech, but to-day, in innumerable positions, Socialist employés who declared their opinions openly would be dismissed. Then again in religious questions there is an immense amount of intolerance and suppression of social and religious discussion to-day, especially in our English villages. As for freedom of action, most of us, from fourteen to the grave, are chased from even the leisure to require freedom by the necessity of earning a living....|$|E
50|$|In Germany {{you really}} have to find a TV channel to raise most of the money and get some more from the film funds. So that next step was tough. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> to follow our vision, which of course would also mean that the story would be told in an arthouse <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> didn't <b>want</b> to {{compromise}} what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to show and what <b>we</b> didn't <b>want</b> to tell.|$|R
5000|$|Randy McDonald was {{in charge}} of art direction, design, and {{production}} for Cinemaware's first four games, and he explains in an interview that [...] "Peter Greene or I would do a sketch of generally what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> for each cover. I went to Western Costume in Hollywood, which for many decades was the giant in the costume industry there, and rented costumes for the types of [...] "look" [...] we had settled on for each cover. We hired models and brought them into Peter’s large photo studio, where we set them up in the costumes I had rented, posed as closely as possible to the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> them to be illustrated." ...|$|R
5000|$|Volume 2 (Breaking Through) is {{the third}} album by the American {{psychedelic}} rock group, the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, and was released in 1967 on Reprise Records (R 6270 mono, RS 6270 stereo). At the time of recording, Michael Lloyd was not present so the group was reduced to Bob Markley, the Harris brothers, and uncredited contributions of Ron Morgan. On the back of original LP release appears 'Breaking Through' and the declaration: [...] "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to say everything <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to say, in the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to say it".|$|R

5000|$|Patricia Morrison: [...] "We {{want to get}} {{out with}} the next record, and the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to present {{ourselves}} live is going to take quite a lot of effort and time. And we'd rather get another record under our belts before we attempt that." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "But I am {{not afraid}} to {{consider}} the final question as to whether, ultimately - in the great future - we can arrange the atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down!

50|$|Every {{permutation}} can {{be produced}} by a sequence of transpositions (2-element exchanges): with the first transposition we put the first element of the permutation in its proper place, the second transposition puts the second element right etc. Since we cannot be left with just a single element in an incorrect position, we must achieve the permutation with our last transposition. Given a permutation σ, we can write it {{as a product of}} transpositions in many different <b>ways.</b> <b>We</b> <b>want</b> to show that either all of those decompositions have an even number of transpositions, or all have an odd number.|$|R
5000|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions were}} {{difficult for the}} band, not the least because Placebo chose Phil Vinall to replace Steve Osborne as producer {{at the last minute}} to produce [...] "Pure Morning". Later on, Placebo's frontman Brian Molko stated that, despite appreciating Osborne's producing skills, the chemistry between band and producer [...] "didn't spark the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to spark", also adding that the album was [...] "overproduced" [...] and contained [...] "too many slow songs for a second album". That said, he did not disown the album, adding that it is still a record the band is proud of.|$|R
6000|$|... "You addle-pated, insolent clown, {{to dispute}} terms with gentlemen in His Majesty's service. Stand aside. I've done you only too much honour by parleying with you. Out of the <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> don't <b>want</b> {{to take a}} stick of your own trumpery, I say." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the {{importance}} of the re-launching the [...] "Syria Times" [...] e-newspaper, Minister al-Zou'bi said: [...] "We are in need for new tools to communicate with English-speaking communities, as to address the people of these communities and present our views and causes the way they understand, and not the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Madraiwiwi {{spoke of}} the need to build {{personal}} relationships on the basis of trust, across ethnic lines. [...] "We must begin to trust each other if this country is to progress the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it to. But before that we have to lay the preparatory work to engender that trust by building relationships every day," [...] he declared.|$|E
5000|$|My budget {{supports}} {{a major new}} National Nanotechnology Initiative, worth $500 million. Caltech {{is no stranger to}} the idea of nanotechnology the ability to manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular level. Over 40 years ago, Caltech's own Richard Feynman asked, [...] "What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At bottom we {{are already}} equal, my honored lord," [...] said Babbalanja, profoundly bowing--"One <b>way</b> <b>we</b> all come into Mardi, and one <b>way</b> <b>we</b> withdraw. <b>Wanting</b> his yams a king will starve, quick as a clown; and smote on the hip, saith old Bardianna, he will roar as loud as the next one." ...|$|R
30|$|As a {{participant}} at our meeting put it, SR is indeed coming our <b>way,</b> whether <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it or not. The growing active {{interest of the}} radiological community suggests {{that we will be}} able to successfully tackle the challenges posed by this paradigm shift in radiology reporting.|$|R
2500|$|Klein {{explained}} [...] "The {{last three}} albums {{have been of}} a piece in some <b>ways,</b> what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> {{to do here is}} start a new chapter. 'The Fly' feels different to me." [...] The video appears on the DVD for The Best of 1990-2000, along with the directors' commentaries.|$|R
50|$|The film {{looks at}} the way we casually live in a class system built on blatant {{economic}} and social disparities, the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be fooled by our belief systems, the way we validate our tastes and are also very protective of them. By exploring a counter-point for every point, the film subtly questions not only our material value system but also our emotional value system.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} DreamWorks Animation series, the Netflix deal allowed DreamWorks {{to maintain}} creative control. Prynoski said: [...] "Typically, {{if you are}} working on a show like this, you might get two sets of notes: one from DreamWorks and one from the network. But we don't get notes from Netflix, which is cool. It allows us to move faster, and we can make the shows, hopefully, the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem with}} the above {{approach}} is that it relies on the differentiability of the objective function and on concavity.

Whereas, {{it would be better}} to say, 'John, you are in the <b>way,</b> where <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to come along.'

500|$|An {{interview}} with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who was originally cast as Rapunzel, reveals {{that at some}} point Rapunzel was intended to be a squirrel. As directors, Greno and Howard felt it essential that Rapunzel resemble a less [...] "passive" [...] heroine than the way she is depicted in the original fairy tale. [...] "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> Rapunzel to be a real role model in a <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't wait around for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life." [...] Tangleds production was surrounded by rumors that it would be Disney's last princess film.|$|R
5000|$|The FA Charity Shield is a match played {{between the}} reigning Premier League Champions and the FA Cup winners one week {{prior to the}} {{commencement}} of the Premier League campaign. However, Manchester United completed a domestic double the previous season and on 14 May 1996 the FA voted to invite Newcastle, rather than FA Cup beaten finalists Liverpool, to play against the Champions at Wembley. The invitation was accepted on 22 May, with Newcastle defender Steve Watson telling the press: [...] "It's brilliant news...It's not the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to qualify for the}} Charity Shield [...] - [...] <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to get there by winning the League.
