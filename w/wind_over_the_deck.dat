5000|$|For example, an AV-8B Harrier with a {{gross weight}} of 29000 lb on a [...] {{day and a}} 35 kn <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> would require 400 ft to takeoff using the 12° {{ski-jump}} ramp on the [...] The same plane would use the entire 750 ft length of the 's flat flight deck. U.S. Marine aviators who experimented with takeoffs from the Spanish aircraft carrier found the improvement to be [...] "nothing short of amazing." [...] The United States {{is the only country}} which operates STOVL aircraft from carriers without a ski-jump ramp.|$|E
5000|$|Royal Navy Tiger Moths {{utilised}} as target tugs and [...] "air experience" [...] machines {{became the}} last military examples when that service purchased {{a batch of}} refurbished ex-civil examples in 1956. One became the last biplane to land on an aircraft carrier (HMS Eagle) in the English Channel during the Summer of 1967. On takeoff, the <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> allowed the aircraft to fly but it was slower than the carrier, which turned hard to starboard to avoid a possible collision. These planes remained in service until the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Prior to World War II, {{the weight}} of most {{aircraft}} allowed them to be launched from aircraft carriers under their own power, but required assistance in stopping. Catapults were installed but were used only when the ship was stationary or adequate <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> could not be arranged by sailing into the wind. Even aircraft {{as large as the}} North American B-25 Mitchell were launched in this manner. This was possible because the ship's speed with even the lightest prevailing winds, combined with a low takeoff speed allowed early aircraft to gain flying speed in a very short distance. The most extreme version of this was the battleship platforms used during the 1920s when small, World War-1 era biplane fighters such as the Sopwith Camel were launched from only a few dozen feet long mounted atop of a battleship's forward gun turret.|$|E
50|$|Carriers steam at speed, up to 35 kn {{into the}} wind during flight deck {{operations}} to increase <b>wind</b> speed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> to a safe minimum. This increase in effective wind speed provides a higher launch airspeed for aircraft {{at the end of}} the catapult stroke or ski-jump, as well as making recovery safer by reducing the difference between the relative speeds of the aircraft and ship.|$|R
60|$|Towards {{night the}} {{snowstorm}} increased in violence. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> piped merrily <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of <b>the</b> steamer {{and the boys}} were glad to remain inside. They turned in early, since {{there was nothing else}} to do.|$|R
25|$|The Nimbus engines were {{produced}} in two main variants, the Mark 103/503 and the Mark 105/502. The Mark 103/503 is generally {{similar to the}} Mark 105/502 except that the former has a double-caliper disc brake incorporated in the output drive shaft to provide adequate braking of the helicopter's rotor in <b>the</b> high <b>winds</b> encountered <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of a fast moving ship, whereas the 105/502 has a single caliper unit.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{circulation}} control was successfully demonstrated in flight using an A- 6 aircraft. Circulation control {{can provide an}} aircraft with STOL performance of heavy lift capability. For ship based Naval aircraft the lower takeoff and landing velocities result in reduced deck gear and <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> requirements. Circulation control airfoils can be mechanically less complex and lightweight compared to multi-element high lift airfoils...|$|E
50|$|Two 4 m high, slitted steel wind {{barriers}} {{were installed}} afore the midships and forward elevators. These {{were designed to}} reduce <b>wind</b> velocity <b>over</b> <b>the</b> flight <b>deck</b> to a distance of approximately 40 m behind them. When not in use they could be lowered flush with <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> to allow aircraft to pass over them.|$|R
2500|$|With HX 237 {{now under}} {{land-based}} aircraft cover, the C-in-C Western Approaches ordered Biter and her escorts [...] south, where the eastbound convoy SC 129 was being {{threatened by a}} gathering wolfpack. On 15 May, light <b>winds</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> flight <b>deck,</b> and <b>the</b> inability of the Swordfish to use the catapult launch rail, limited their bomb load to two [...] bombs. Just before they closed on the convoy a Swordfish attacked a surfaced U-boat. The two bombs caused no damage to the submarine which returned fire, damaging the plane and wounding the air observer. Their relief shadowed the submarine until it dived when it carried out another unsuccessful attack. At 13:45, Biter closed with the convoy and commenced anti-submarine patrols. The convoy reached Britain on 16 May without any loss, and Biter was ordered to the Clyde. As a result of Biter′s experiences on these early convoys, the complement of aircraft carried was increased to 15 bombers and six fighters, with a 50% increase in air crews. Homing beacons were to be fitted to all carriers together with a Type 237 blind approach beam system for use in poor visibility.|$|R
40|$|When {{conducting}} landings to a ship’s deck {{in strong}} winds, helicopter pilot workload is often {{dominated by the}} turbulence within the ship’s airwake. Previous {{studies have shown that}} larger ships create more aggressive airwakes and simulated flight trials had shown that it can be easier to land to a smaller ship than a large one. However, there are helicopter-enabled ships that are less than 100 m in length and these will have significantly greater ship motion in rough seas than a large ship. The study reported in this paper has used a motion-base flight simulator to evaluate the pilot workload when landing to three geometrically similar ships of lengths 100 m, 150 m and 200 m. Ship motion software has been used to create realistic deck displacements for sea states 4, 5 and 6, which are consistent with <b>the</b> increasing <b>wind</b> speed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> It has been shown that the 100 m ship was the most difficult to land to, with <b>deck</b> motion being <b>the</b> limiting factor. The next most difficult ship to land to was the 200 m ship, with airwake turbulence being the limiting factor. The 150 m ship generated the lowest pilot workload. The study has demonstrated that when ship motion is excessive, as it will be with small ships in rough seas, pilot workload will be dominated by deck motion during a landing task, but as the ship gets larger and more stable, airwake disturbances will dominate. It is clear from this study that realistic ship motion is essential when using piloted flight simulation to conduct simulated ship-helicopter operations...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{application}} of spaceborne scatterometry has been measurements of near-surface <b>winds</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ocean. Such instruments {{are known as}} wind scatterometers. By combining sigma-0 measurements from different azimuth angles, <b>the</b> near-surface <b>wind</b> vector <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ocean's surface can be determined using a geophysical model function (GMF) which relates <b>wind</b> and backscatter. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> ocean, the radar backscatter results from scattering from wind-generated capillary-gravity waves, which are generally in equilibrium with <b>the</b> near-surface <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ocean. The scattering mechanism is known as Bragg scattering, which occurs from the waves that are in resonance with the microwaves.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the spatial}} {{patterns}} and their interannual variability of wintertime low-level <b>winds</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Indochina Peninsula (IDP) were studied {{by using the}} analysis of the empirical orthogonal function for complex numbers. The leading mode accounts for 46. 6 % of the total variance. The composite and regressed patterns of wind components show dominant northeasterly <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> IDP, which are related to the East Asia winter monsoon (EAWM) circulation and connected to the cyclonic circulation near Borneo. The correlations between the EAWM indices and the leading principal component (PC) suggest the plausible connections between <b>the</b> low-level <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> IDP and EAWM predominantly via the wind circulation. We also performed correlation analysis on the relationship between leading mode and sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). The result indicates that there is a linkage between <b>the</b> northeasterly <b>wind</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> IDP and EAWM and with SSTAs in the Pacific Ocean. This study provides useful information and a mechanism related to <b>the</b> monsoon variability <b>over</b> <b>the</b> IDP...|$|R
