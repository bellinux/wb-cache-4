30|$|Plywood is a wood-based panel {{material}} {{produced by}} alternately laminating veneers with parallel and perpendicular grain directions. The grain direction of each veneer may affect embedment behavior in plywood–solid <b>wood</b> <b>nail</b> joints. On the shear performance of plywood–solid wood nailed joints, {{the effect of}} the grain direction of plywood has been investigated under single-shear loading. Stewart [22] conducted a single-shear test with nailed joint specimens. He prepared two types of plywood joint specimens. In the joint specimes, the plywood was attached to become that the grain direction of surface veneer were parallel or perpendicular to the load direction. The load–deformation curves of the two types of specimens were not considerably different. Harada et al. [23] conducted the tests with similar types of specimen and reported no large difference in maximum load. However, the deformation at maximum load in the case of plywood with perpendicular grain of the surface veneer was higher than that of parallel grain. Meanwhile, Demirkir and Colakoglu [24] reported that stiffness was higher when the surface direction of plywood was parallel to the loading direction than when the surface direction of plywood was perpendicular to the loading direction. Hagiwara [25] reported no difference in shear performance between the parallel and perpendicular grain directions of plywood. However, when the angle between the grain and load directions was 30 °, 45 ° or 60 °, resistance performance decreased under a small load range.|$|E

50|$|This was {{designed}} by Emiel Fox (1869 or 1870-1941). Patents relating to early versions of the lock go back to at least 1907. Fox set up the Fox Police Lock Company in New York City to manufacture the locks under the brand name Police Lock; other companies have made similar locks under the same designation, so the term has become genericized to a degree. The name comes from the police procedure for securing a damaged door, which uses a similarly angled piece of sturdy <b>wood</b> <b>nailed</b> in place.|$|R

50|$|Hearing of the 1848 California Gold Rush, Howe sailed around South America {{through the}} Drake Passage to reach California. He {{returned}} to Massachusetts in 1850, having {{run out of}} money and found no gold. The trip to California was a harsh one, particularly the sleeping accommodations. Beds consisted of little more than planks of <b>wood</b> <b>nailed</b> to a frame, and the slighest movement of the ship was transferred to the sleeper—making for restless sleep, and often inducing seasickness. Determined to invent an improved bed, Howe began work on a bed in which elliptical springs supported free-floating slats, and the frame of the bed kept the slats in a rectangular shape.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date:An {{important}} factor affecting {{the strength and}} ultimate load of wood structures is the strength, stiffness and durability of its joints. Therefore, the behavior of nailed joints must be given proper consideration when designing and analyzing wood structures. Presently, formulas for determining the strength of nailed joints under withdrawal loads, as outlined in the National Design Specifications and the Uniform Building Code, {{are based on the}} statistical regression between maximum withdrawal load (W) and the material properties of the <b>wood</b> and <b>nail.</b> New models were developed which predict W, withdrawal resistance (WR) and withdrawal stiffness (WK) based on the actual forces responsible for holding the <b>nail</b> in the <b>wood.</b> These include a normal force to the nail due to the elastically compressed <b>wood</b> around the <b>nail</b> and the resulting friction between the <b>wood</b> and <b>nail</b> surfaces. The accuracy of these models were compared to the accepted formulas in the design codes and were found to be superior in predicting W, WR and WK...|$|R

A tropical storm watch was posted for Puerto Rico at the time. The warnings, excluding {{those for the}} Virgin Islands, were discontinued on August15. As Cindy drifted further north later that day, the watch for Puerto Rico was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Officials issued flash flood warnings for parts of the island, and about 600people living in flood-prone areas sought shelter ahead of the storm. Ferry service between Fajardo and the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques was suspended, leaving about 400passengers stranded for a day.

The predominance the silver was due to the cheapness of the material compared to gold, and also for their physical and chemical properties, to facilitate its alloy with copper and to facilitate their development, giving a material hardness. There were parts made from a single piece by casting, and others formed by different plates welded on <b>wood</b> <b>nailed</b> together or via tabs. A silver plate was given the shape of the inlay, based on blows with the hammer to achieve planned shape; and plates reinforced the edge moldings which in turn served as ornamentation.

60|$|Aware of Stumps's propensity, Slagg had so {{arranged}} {{that his}} friend should {{lie at the}} stern of the raft with two strands of the binding-cable between him and Robin, who lay next to him. During {{the first part of the}} night, Stumps, either overcome by weariness or subdued by his friends' discourses on the stellar world, behaved pretty well.

But, about daybreak, he began to sprawl, gradually working his way to the extreme edge of the raft, where a piece of <b>wood,</b> <b>nailed</b> there on purpose, prevented him from rolling off altogether. It did not, however, prevent his tossing one of his long legs over the edge, which he accordingly did. The leg and foot were naked.

It had been arranged that Geoffrey only should go up, Lionel removing the pole when he entered, and keeping watch behind the out house lest anyone should come round the house. Both had cut heavy sticks as they came along to give them some means of defence. Lionel stood at the pole, while Geoffrey climbed up, removed the piece of wood from the staple, and then holding the hasp to prevent the wind blowing in the door with a crash, entered the loft. A glance showed him that it extended over the whole of the house, and that it was entirely empty.|$|R
