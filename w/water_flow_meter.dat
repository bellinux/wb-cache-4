In this paper, a novel modelling method using a new reference model for {{fault detection}} and diagnosis in water chillers was developed, and the real evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{was replaced by a}} pseudo evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate that was equal to the designed evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate or the average evaporator flow rate under stable operation conditions.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new, {{improved}} method for <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>metering.</b> It applies to a transit time ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> device. In principle, {{the flow of}} a given liquid in a pipe is obtained by measuring the transit times of an ultrasonic wave in the upstream and downstream directions. The difference between these times is, in theory, linearly proportional to the liquid flow velocity. However, the fainter the flow is, the smaller the transit time difference (TTD) is. This difference can be as low as a few picoseconds, which gives rise to many technical difficulties in measuring such a small time difference with a given accuracy. The proposed method relies on measuring the TTD indirectly by computing the phase difference between the steady-state parts of the received signals in the upstream and downstream directions and by using a least-square-sine-fitting technique. This reduces {{the effect of the}} jitter noise and the offset, which limit measurement precision at very low flow velocity. The obtained measurement results illustrate the robustness of the proposed method, as we measure the TTD at no-flow conditions, with a precision as low as 10 ps peak-to-peak and a TTD offset of zero, within a temperature range from room temperature to 80 °C. This allows us to reach a smaller minimum detectable flow when compared with previous techniques. The proposed method exhibits a better trade-off between measurement accuracy and system complexity. It can be completely integrated in an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) or incorporated in a CPU- or micro-controller-based system...|$|R

40|$|To {{effectively}} {{manage and}} save energy and natural resources, the measurement and monitoring of gas/fluid flows play extremely important roles. The {{objective of this}} study was to incorporate an efficient power generation and a power management system for a commercial <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> thus eliminating the usage of batteries. Three major technologies have made this possible: a low power consumption metering unit, a cog-resistance-free generator with high efficiency; and an effective methodology to extract/store energy. In this system, a new attempt and simple approach was developed to successfully extract a portion of the kinetic energy from the fluid/air, store it in a capacitor and used it efficiently. The resistance to the flow was negligible because of the very low power consumption as well as the application of the coreless generator technology. Feasibility was demonstrated through repeated experiments: for air flowing in an 11 mm diameter pipe, 18 s of energy harvesting at 10 revolution-per-second (RPS) turbine speeds generated enough power for the flowmeter to operate for 720 s with a flowrate of 20 RPS, without battery or any external power.

The is {{intended}} to improve brewing process efficiency while reducing the footprint of the brewing equipment. The device contains a coil made from 3 / 8 ” soft copper tubing. The coil is inserted into a housing which is constructed of two 22 -gauge stainless steel cylinders and a layer of ceramic insulation. Attached to the inlet and outlet of the coil are monitoring and control devices. On the inlet is a <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> which allows the user to monitor flow rate and total flow through the coil. On the outlet of the device is a ball valve (used to control the flow through the coil) and an inline thermometer. This allows the user to monitor and control the temperature to the desired temperature. Mounted under the housing/ coil devices is a 55, 000 BTU propane burner. The burner is capable of increasing water flowing at 0. 5 gpm from 55 ºF to 195 ºF instantly. The entire system has mounting brackets attached to it {{to allow it to}} be easily connected to the collapsible beer rack system.

This could then be used to determine the water heater efficiency ? the ratio of energy out (hot water delivered) to energy in (energy in the gas) in actual residential installations. The goal was to be as unobtrusive as possible, and to avoid invalidating warranties or exposing researchers to liability issues. If feasible this approach would reduce the costs of instrumentation. This paper describes the limited field and laboratory investigations to determine if using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters is feasible for field monitoring. It was more complicated to use the existing gas <b>flow,</b> <b>water</b> and temperature sensors than was anticipated. To get the signals from the existing sensors and controls is difficult and may involve making changes that would invalidate manufacturer warrantees. The procedures and methods for using signals from the existing gas valves, <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> and temperature sensors will vary by model.

40|$|This thesis {{will discuss}} future {{challenges}} regarding storm water in Asker municipality, and argue {{the effect of}} selected preventive measures. Climate changes, increased population and densification of cities are {{the main cause of}} these challenges. The UN climate panel has used a lot of resources to estimate future climate based on historical data. The forecast they have come up with contains a lot of uncertainty, but at least it can point in what direction it is going. The global tendency shows that the precipitation will increase in areas near the poles. Norway will get more precipitation and more intense rainfall. Norway is a country with large areas and few people, but the portion of people living in the urban areas is increasing. More rain and increasing population are pushing the existing infrastructure to its limits. Additional development in the existing urban areas leads to more impermeable surfaces and greater expenses to rehabilitate and develop new pipe systems. Several issues have already emerged due to storm water. These are cases like increased damage on basements, more discharges from overflows and more damages on infrastructure caused by flooding. This thesis will analyse an area in the municipality of Asker, which is located in south-eastern Norway. The municipality is experiencing additional population growth. The simulation of the area is done with a model from Mike Urban. The model was calibrated against a <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> It was simulated rain events that were constructed on the basis of historical precipitation measurements. These rain events were simulated both with and without a climate surcharge of 50 %. It was also implemented relevant preventing measures to the model. The preventive measures that were simulated were disconnection of roof surfaces, attenuation in pond and expansion of the diameter in critical pipes. The various measures were evaluated on the basis of hydraulic effect. The thesis ends with an economic analysis of the chosen measures. The results indicated that climate change will lead to increased damages due to storm water, but because the model is not completely finished the results is very uncertain. The most effective preventing measure was disconnecting the roof surfaces, both in terms of hydraulic and economic impact. Expansion of diameter gave good effect for precipitation with low intervals of replicate. The preventing measurement was considered profitable by bulging. Attenuation gave almost no effect, but the result was considered wrong on the basis of deficiencies in the model...|$|E

40|$|Residential {{resource}} use efficiency and management {{is a subject}} of interest {{to a number of}} fields spanning the physical and social sciences. Energy use for residential water heating in Australia is some five to eleven times more than the energy required to deliver urban water services. However, little is known about which activities within households contribute most significantly to water-related energy use (WRE). This work quantifies WRE use in individual households, and identifies household characteristics which contribute significantly to variation. Empirical data were collected through in-home audits, interviews and high-resolution end-use <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> for five households in Melbourne, and two in Brisbane, Australia. This was used to characterise 139 parameters describing household occupancy characteristics, behaviours, technologies, and structural and environmental aspects of influence. Mathematical material flow analysis (MMFA) modelling was conducted for individual water and energy use subsystems within each household. WRE use ranged from 7 to 21 kWh hh d (13 – 24 % of total household energy use in Melbourne and 76 – 79 % in Brisbane). Detailed end use analysis of the five Melbourne households showed that shower use (11 – 61 % WRE), hot water system efficiency losses (8 – 31 % WRE) and clothes washer usage (4 – 17 % WRE) contributed most to differences in WRE between households. Findings highlighted shower use as a consistent influence on WRE across households, and suggest further investigation of shower programs as a potentially effective demand management measure for both water and energy in households. The work highlights the importance of consistent messaging for both water and energy efficiency, and suggests that a focus on both human and technical characteristics of households is needed for effective management of combined water and energy use...|$|R
50|$|The areas many dams provide {{multiple}} {{forms of}} use. Crystal Springs Dam provides many boating and angling opportunities. The Dam is {{fed by the}} pure water of Crystal Springs, {{the main source of}} Kokstad’s water supply. In 1924, William Mortimer Mail (b. 16 November 1885) was to take-up an appointment as the Kokstad Town Engineer, Arguably, William Mail’s most notable achievement was improvement to Kokstad’s drinking water, which at the time of William’s arrival, was drawn from a mountain stream. Whenever it rained, became heavily stained. After identifying a suitable spring further down the mountain (Crystal Springs), he first conducted a series of <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate <b>metering,</b> to establish there was sufficient flow to meet the town’s needs. Once it had been proven there was sufficient flow, William then oversaw design & construction of a new water treatment plant. The new plant provided crystal clear water to Kokstad, which assisted the town to grow and flourish.|$|R
5000|$|PD meters are {{generally}} very accurate at the low-to-moderate flow rates typical of residential and small commercial users, and commonly {{range in size}} from 5/8" [...] to 2". Because displacement meters require that all <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> through the <b>meter</b> to [...] "push" [...] the measuring element, they generally are not practical in large commercial applications requiring high flow rates or low pressure loss. PD meters normally have a built-in strainer to protect the measuring element from rocks or other debris that could stop or break the measuring element. PD meters normally have bronze, brass or plastic bodies with internal measuring chambers made of molded plastics and stainless steel.|$|R
