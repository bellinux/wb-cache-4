They have got the capital locked up, and {{the land is}} dead. They find it cheaper to let all the arable go back to fallow, and raise a few head of cattle, rather than to pay high wages, grow corn, and get small returns.|$|E

I became Man in her imagination, the protagonist of the world. At first I displayed the modest worthy desire for respectable service that Harbury had taught me, but her clear, sceptical little voice pierced and tore all those pretences to shreds.

60|$|Suddhoo's cousin's son told me, one evening, that Suddhoo {{wanted to}} see me; {{that he was too}} old and feeble to come personally, and that I should be conferring an {{everlasting}} honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to him. I went; but I think, seeing how well off Suddhoo was then, that he might have sent something better than an ekka, which jolted fearfully, to haul out a future Lieutenant-Governor to the City on a muggy April evening. The ekka did not run quickly. It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of Ranjit Singh's Tomb near the main gate of the Fort.

I asked her what ailed her and tried to comfort her, but she didn't explain; she only said it was nothing, the effect of the sea, of leaving home. I asked her if it {{had anything to do with}} her prospects, with her marriage; whether she found as that drew near that her heart was not in it; I told her that she mustn't be nervous, that I could enter into that--in short I said what I could. All that she replied was that she was nervous, very nervous, but that it was already over; and then she jumped up and kissed me and went away. Does she look as if she had been crying?' Mrs. Nettlepoint asked.|$|E

60|$|One day I {{was visited}} by an artist from a {{distance}} who, when shown the thorn, pronounced it a fine subject for his pencil, and while he made his picture <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hawthorn generally as compared with other trees, and agreed that, except in its blossoming time when it is merely pretty, {{it is the most}} engaging and perhaps the most beautiful of our native trees. We said that it was the most individual of trees, that its variety was infinite, for you never find two alike, whether growing in a forest, in groups, or masses, or alone. We were almost lyrical in its praises. But the solitary thorn was always best, he said, and this one was perhaps the best of all he had seen: strange {{and at the same time}} decorative in its form, beautiful too in its appearance of great age with unimpaired vigour and something more in its expression--that elusive something which we find in some trees and don't know how to explain.|$|E
6000|$|I wish I had any faculty {{whatever}} {{of remembering}} what people say; but, though I appreciate anything {{good at the}} moment, it never stays in my memory; nor do I think, in fact, that anything definite, rounded, pointed, separable, and transferable from the general lump of conversation was said by anybody. I recollect that they laughed at Mr. ------, and at his shedding a tear into a Scottish river, on occasion of some literary festival. [...] . They spoke approvingly of Bulwer, as valuing his literary position, and holding himself one of the brotherhood of authors; and not so approvingly of Charles Dickens, who, born a plebeian, aspires to aristocratic society. But I {{said that it was}} easy to condescend, and that Bulwer knew he could not put off his rank, and that he would have all the advantages of it in spite of his authorship. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> position of men of letters in England, and they said that the aristocracy hated and despised and feared them; and I asked why it was that literary men, having really so much power in their hands, were content to live unrecognized in the State.|$|E
60|$|Three or {{four miles}} from Ottery St. Mary I overtook a cowman driving nine milch cows along a deep lane and inquired {{my way of}} him. He gave me many and minute directions, after which we got into conversation, and I walked some {{distance}} with him. The cows he was driving were all pure Devons, perfect beauties in their bright red coats in that greenest place where every rain-wet leaf sparkled in the new sunlight. Naturally <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cows, and I soon found that they were his own and the pride and joy of his life. We walked leisurely, and as the animals went on, first one, then another would stay for a mouthful of grass, or to pull down half a yard of green drapery from the hedge. It was so lavishly decorated that the damage they did to it was not noticeable. By and by we went on ahead of the cows, then, if one stayed too long or strayed into some inviting side-lane, he would turn and utter a long, soft call, whereupon the straggler would leave her browsing and hasten after the others.|$|E
