5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even more prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> a heavy train.

5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
5|$|From Spring 2007 to 2008 the {{messages}} were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala. The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost {{was greater than}} the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.|$|E

5|$|La Fleche (18891916) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After {{being sold}} {{for a world}} record price as a {{yearling}} in 1890, she was undefeated as a two-year-old in 1891, winning races against her own sex and defeating some of the year's leading colts. She {{went on to become}} the dominant British three-year-old of 1892, claiming the Fillies’ Triple Crown by winning the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom and the St Leger at Doncaster. Her only defeat of the year came when she was beaten <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> favourite for The Derby.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter homolog, carbon. Its {{capacity to do}} so is much less because the Pb–Pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E

5|$|There {{are limits}} on the power a device may draw, {{stated in terms of}} a unit load, which is 100mA or 150mA for SuperSpeed devices. There are {{low-power}} and high-power devices. Low-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load, and all devices must act as low-power devices <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> out as unconfigured. High-power devices draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices. A high-powered device must be configured, and may only draw as much power as specified in its configuration. I.e., the maximum power may not be available.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip <b>when</b> <b>starting.</b> The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
5|$|After Kettering {{chairman}} Imraan Ladak {{decided to}} reduce the club's wage bill, on 26 November 2010, Boucaud joined their Conference Premier rivals York City on loan until January 2011, {{with a view to}} a permanent transfer. He had made 21 appearances for Kettering up to that point in 2010–11. His debut for York came as a 76th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw away to Kidderminster Harriers on 30 November 2010, which was followed by his first start and home debut in a 1–0 defeat to Conference North team Boston United in the FA Trophy first round on 11 December. Boucaud signed for York permanently for a fee of £20,000 on 5 January 2011 on a two-and-half-year contract that would expire in the summer of 2013. His first appearance after signing permanently came <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> in a 1–0 home win over Grimsby Town on 11 January 2011. He finished the season with 20 York appearances.|$|E

5|$|As he was {{not playing}} {{regularly}} for Mansfield, Beardsley joined Conference National club Rushden & Diamonds on a one-month loan on 19 January 2007. He made his debut a day later, <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> in Rushden's 2–1 home victory against Stafford Rangers, and scored his first goal in the following match, with a 75th-minute header in a 3–1 home win over Cambridge United. Having helped Rushden move up the table with two goals from three matches, he signed for the club permanently on 31 January 2007 on a one-and-a-half-year contract on a free transfer. He finished 2006–07 with 13 appearances and 2 goals for Rushden, as they finished the season in 12th-place in the Conference National. However, he was released the club in May 2007 following a change in management.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege {{has both}} a single-player and {{multiplayer}} mode. The single-player mode {{consists of a}} single story and world; players can either create a new character <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via local area networks, direct IP addresses, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking service.|$|E

His second debut came <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> their 1–1 away draw with Liaoning Whowin on 9 March 2014, before scoring his first goal of the 2014 Chinese Super League with a left-footed volley from outside the penalty area in a 1–1 draw at home to Shanghai Greenland Shenhua on 26 April. He went without scoring in the final {{three months of the}} season, which he finished with five goals from 28 appearances as Shanghai ranked in fifth place in the 2014 Chinese Super League table. McBreen stated his desire to stay for another season, but admitted he might not be retained after the club was taken over by new owners.|$|E

He was released by Macclesfield in November 2015 after making seven appearances for the club, and was denied a move to Barrow by the Football Association as he could not join a third club at that stage of the season. Meikle joined Alfreton Town of the National League North on 3 December 2015, making his debut two days later <b>when</b> <b>starting</b> their 1–0 away defeat to Lowestoft Town.

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach {{consists of}} the player completing lessons that introduce new vocabulary and then focus on mastering the words through several puzzle games. As the player progresses through the game, the words increase in difficulty. When first starting the game, the player takes an introductory test that gauges their initial comprehension level of the French or Spanish language. The player is then placed into a level reflective of the score they received on the test. A player who scores highly {{will be able to}} skip many of the initial levels and more basic concepts. <b>When</b> <b>starting</b> a lesson, the player is shown ten new words, which include nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, as well as their meanings and proper enunciation.|$|E
