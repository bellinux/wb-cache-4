5000|$|The Thugs was a tag {{team that}} {{consisted}} of [...] "The Dirty White Boy" [...] Tony Anthony and Tracy Smothers. The duo first wrestled as a tag team on March 23, 1995 where Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Boy</b> acted as Smothers' partner in a tag team match against The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) during Smothers' feud with Gangstas. In those days, Boo Bradley was the partner of Tracy Smothers but Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Boy</b> would occasionally team with Smothers against Gangstas. Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Boy</b> and Smothers went on to lose the match. The next day, on March 24, Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Boy</b> replaced Boo Bradley in a tag team match where Smothers and Bradley took on The Gangstas but just got pinned. Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Boy</b> and Tracy Smothers would not team up together for two shows in March because Smothers and Bradley feuded with Gangstas while Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Boy</b> feuded with Buddy Landel.|$|R

25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} is {{also evident}} in education. Michael Sheperd’s study on teacher's perceptions of student responses compares how favorably teachers from the Los Angeles area viewed a response with the race and gender of the student speaker. Students were grouped based on white or minority and male or female. Teachers of various racial and ethnic backgrounds tended to view responses attributed to white females as being most favorable, followed by <b>white</b> <b>boys,</b> then minority girls. Students who were perceived as minority boys were ranked least favorably. Particularly noteworthy {{is the fact that}} Black and Hispanic teachers tended to rank responses given by minority boys, minority girls, and <b>white</b> <b>boys,</b> significantly lower than other teachers. While indicative of on overall stigmatization of boys, the study also provides evidence that the negative associations with minority students (who are identified through linguistic profiling) are held by members of all racial groups.|$|E

25|$|During the siege, the Mafeking Cadet Corps of <b>white</b> <b>boys</b> below {{fighting}} age stood guard, carried messages, {{assisted in}} hospitals, and so on, freeing grown men to fight. Baden-Powell did not form the Cadet Corps himself, {{and there is}} no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege.

25|$|The Mafeking Cadet Corps was a {{group of}} boy cadets formed by Lord Edward Cecil shortly before the 217 day Siege of Mafeking in South Africa during the Second Boer War in 1899-1900.

The cadets {{consisted}} of volunteer <b>white</b> <b>boys</b> below fighting age and were used to support the troops, carry messages, and help in the hospital. This freed up men for military duties, and kept the boys occupied.|$|E

25|$|Strange Fruit {{takes place}} in a Georgia town in the 1920s and focuses on the {{relationship}} between Tracy Deen, son of some prominent white townspeople, and Nonnie, a beautiful and intelligent young black woman whom he once rescued from being attacked by a group of <b>white</b> <b>boys.</b> The two had been holding a secret affair, with Nonnie becoming pregnant with Tracy's child, only for Tracy to at one point plan for her to marry 'Big Henry', a man she despises. Tracy himself had originally planned to marry another white townsperson, but changed his mind after a conversation with one of the local preachers and intends on making his relationship with Nonnie public. He instead goes to Nonnie's house and tells her of his original intent to have her wed to Big Henry, having paid him money to do so. Despite this change of heart, Nonnie's brother overhears Big Henry telling of Tracy's payment and Big Henry's impending wedding to Nonnie and why. This prompts Nonnie's brother to go after Tracy and when Tracy's body is discovered later by Big Henry, Big Henry is accused of murdering a white man and is lynched.|$|E
25|$|After {{failing to}} catch on in Texas and leaving the AWA, the Fabulous Ones {{returned}} ”home” to Memphis and were immediately thrust into the tag team title chase. On October 8 the Fabs defeated first the Nightmares then the Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Boys</b> before losing to Rick Rude and King Kong Bundy in a one night tournament to crown new Southern Tag Team Champions. Keirn and Lane soon got their revenge by winning their 8th Southern Tag Team title from Bundy and Rude on October 22. The team {{held on to the}} gold for a little over 6 weeks before losing it to the team of Don Bass and Roger Smith, also known as the Interns. On February 17, 1985 the Fabulous Ones regained the Southern Tag-Team championship from the Interns before launching into a feud with the PYT Express (Koko Ware and Norvell Austin), a team that like the Fabulous Ones played on the “Pretty Boy” gimmick. On April 15 the PYT Express won the gold through underhanded means and continued to fend off the Fabulous Ones through various “shady” tactics until they were stripped of the gold in June. After the PYT Express left the area Keirn and Lane easily won the Southern Tag Team Title once more defeating Ron Sexton and Billy Travis in a tournament final.|$|E
