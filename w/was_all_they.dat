5|$|Unchained {{includes}} {{all the characters}} from the GameCube version, and four more characters — Blaze, Frost, Jax and Kitana — from Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance that are exclusive to the PlayStation Portable version. The four characters have only one Fatality and no Hara-kiri in contrast to other characters, most likely because that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> had in Deadly Alliance. Exclusive to the Unchained version is the Endurance mode, where players can compete against a constant wave of opponents. The system's wireless ad hoc network functionality {{can be used for}} multiplayer games. Characters who remain hidden in the other versions appear unlocked by default in Unchained; producer Shaun Himmerick explained that the staff wanted to show players characters that were difficult to obtain in Deception, such as Liu Kang. Although Midway did not develop the game, they helped Just Games Interactives optimize their code and the Wi-Fi feature, as they wanted to keep the frame rate very high. Metacritic gave it an average of 70 from 14 reviews. Jeff Haynes from IGN mentioned problems with the controls and criticized the long loading times.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on August 30 {{to play the}} Arizona Diamondbacks. Ian Kennedy and three relievers held the Dodgers scoreless and Kershaw allowed one 2-run homer by Chris Young and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> needed as the Diamondbacks beat the Dodgers 2–0. The team dropped to 4 games behind the Giants, their largest deficit of the season. Reliever Matt Guerrier allowed a solo homer to Jason Kubel in the 11th inning on August 31, to give the Dodgers a 4–3 loss, their eighth straight loss to the Diamondbacks on the season.|$|E

25|$|Henry J. Kaiser's {{company had}} been {{building}} cargo ships for the U.S. Maritime Commission in the late 1930s. In 1940 orders for ships from the British government, already at war with Nazi Germany, allowed for growth. Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard beginning in December 1940, eventually building three more in Richmond; each yard with four to eight slips to build ships. Kaiser-Permanente specialized in mass-producing Liberty ships quickly and efficiently, and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> built until 1944, when they switched to the much more complicated Victory ships and built some tugs and Landing Ship, Tank (LSTs) and other specialized ships in the newly built Yard #4.|$|E
25|$|JCP {{had almost}} {{accomplished}} {{its goal of}} creating a national promotion. Between the purchasing of several NWA territories, World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas leaving the NWA in 1986 (and later merging with Jerry Jarrett's Championship Wrestling Alliance in Memphis to create the United States Wrestling Association brand), and the once highly viable Pacific Northwest territory, {{as it had been}} known, closing in 1992, WCW was the last bastion of the NWA, and the last member with national television exposure. Since it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> now saw, people began to believe that WCW was the NWA. Although WCW and the NWA were still two separate entities, with Crockett as NWA President, they were very much on the same page. The NWA was effectively an on-paper organization funded by Jim Crockett Promotions, and allowed JCP to use the NWA brand name for promoting.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth {{straight}} game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13–3 at Coors Field. In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup {{at the same time}} (Tony Gwynn, Jr., Jerry Hairston, Jr., Iván DeJesús, Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6–2 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3–2. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Elián Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4–3 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee {{in the top of the}} eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2–1 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6-5. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8–3 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a cross-country flight to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers got back into the winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw stuck out a season high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston, Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8–3 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8–2 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.|$|E

2500|$|The Broncos scored first after linebacker Tom Jackson's fumble {{recovery}} on the Steelers 22 set up quarterback John Elway's 9-yard {{touchdown pass}} to Jim Wright. [...] But that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could manage for the entire first half as they {{spent the rest of}} blowing scoring chances. [...] Kicker Rich Karlis missed two field goals, one from 39 yards and the other from 57, while the team also had a drive that reached the Steelers 6-yard line come up empty when Elway's screen pass was intercepted by nose tackle Gary Dunn. [...] In the second quarter, Pittsburgh went up 10-7 on Gary Anderson's 28-yard field goal and Frank Pollard's 1-yard run.|$|E
2500|$|The team {{time trial}} went {{about as well}} as the squad could have hoped. They set the best time at the {{intermediate}} time check and at the finish line, the first and only squad to finish under 21 minutes. Though they finished with only five riders, five <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> needed, as the squad's time was taken for the fifth man to cross the line. Pinotti indeed was the first over, and took the first pink jersey. It was the second time in his career he held the Giro race lead, having previously held it for four days in the 2008 Giro d'Italia. He made it clear after the stage that the team's focus for stage 2 would be Cavendish, in the sprint. Given that the Giro awards time bonuses for the first three riders to finish a road race stage, that made it extremely likely that Cavendish would take the pink jersey the next day. The team did work for Cavendish in stage 2, and he did become the new race leader, but he missed out on the stage win. 's Alessandro Petacchi opened the sprint first, to the right of Cavendish's last leadout man Renshaw, leaving Cavendish to take the line to Renshaw's left. Just as Cavendish occupied a position with open road in front of him, Petacchi deviated from his line and rode directly in front of Cavendish for a few meters. When Cavendish tried to go around Petacchi, the Italian again changed his line to stay in front of Cavendish. After a moment, both sprinted with open road in front of them, and Petacchi came across the line first by a matter of millimeters. Cavendish was visibly upset, shouting and gesticulating at Petacchi after they crossed the finish line. Cavendish later explained that his frustration was not directed at Petacchi, but at race officials, since he felt he would be relegated if he had sprinted in a similar manner. However, he also said that he never had the intention of appealing the result. His sporting director Valerio Piva also took that stance, stating that Petacchi's sprint was [...] "not really fair play." [...] The next day, Cavendish made a point of apologizing to Petacchi via Twitter for his outburst after crossing the finish line. Cavendish then rode as race leader on stage 3, the day Wouter Weylandt died, finishing well back after repeated mechanical trouble. Sivtsov, Pinotti, and Lewis remained highly placed overall, staying so after the neutralized fourth stage had no effect on any of the race's standings.|$|E
