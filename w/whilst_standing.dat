25|$|During her {{pregnancy}} with Dutugemunu, Viharamahadevi {{had a series}} of peculiar cravings, including the urge to sleep on a pillow made of honeycombs. In particular her urge to drink the water used to wash a sword that had cleaved the head of a warrior of Elara, <b>whilst</b> <b>standing</b> on that same head, raised the interest of the soothsayers at court, who predicted that 'The queen's son, when he has vanquished the Damilas (Tamil invaders) and built up a united kingdom, will make the doctrine to shine forth brightly'. Viharamahadevi gave birth to a son named Gamani Abhaya some time later, and after that to another child, a boy named Tissa.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match that aired, Raw's Edge, Randy Orton, and Jeff Hardy Smackdown!'s King Booker (with Queen Sharmell), Mr. Kennedy, Matt Hardy and Dave Finlay and ECW's CM Punk {{competed in the}} third annual Money in the Bank ladder match. The match {{featured}} many notable spots, including points where Edge performed the Spear on all the other opponents, followed by Randy Orton doing the same by leveling {{many of the participants}} with his RKO later in the match. Mr. Kennedy missed a Kenton Bomb and landed on a ladder {{on the back of his}} neck. He instead received a Swanton Bomb from Jeff Hardy. Several dangerous ladder spots were also featured, including Orton performing an RKO on CM Punk <b>whilst</b> <b>standing</b> on the ladder, and King Booker performing his Book End to Orton from the top of the ladder as well. Midway through the match, Jeff Hardy climbed a fifteen-foot-high ladder inside the ring and on his brother, Matt Hardy's urging, he performed a leg drop off of that ladder onto Edge, who was lying prone on another ladder outside the ring, set-up on the ring apron and the barricade. Due to the impact, the ladder on which Edge was placed, broke in half and he, along with Jeff, were severely injured. They were carried off on stretchers by the paramedics. Later, when Booker was about to retrieve the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy held Booker's wife, Queen Sharmell as a hostage, threatening to perform his Twist of Fate on her. Booker went to her aid and received the Twist of Fate from Matt. Finlay fought Matt for sometime in the ring, and also performed his Celtic Cross to Matt onto a ladder. Finlay's associate Hornswoggle emerged from under the ring and attempted to retrieve the briefcase for Finlay. He was stopped by Kennedy, who performed his Green Bay Plunge on Hornswoggle. Kennedy went on to win the match, only after knocking CM Punk off a ladder by hitting him with another ladder.|$|E

500|$|Whereas {{competitors}} in the first series of Robot Wars had largely featured passive weapons, the second series saw {{a greater number of}} robots—including the series champion, Panic Attack—using lifting and flipping weapons designed to overturn an opponent. Lewis and Scott noted that when Razer was overturned with its piercing arm fully upright, the robot was more than halfway towards naturally rolling back onto its wheels. Therefore, rather than equipping Razer with a powered mechanism for righting itself when inverted, two wings were attached to the arm. Tensioned via cables, the wings opened when the arm was fully raised, levering Razer back onto its wheels. The unique design provided Razer with a [...] "victory salute"—raising its claw and wings <b>whilst</b> <b>standing</b> on its tail—but had the downside of putting the machine over the weight limit of [...]|$|E

The work was photographed by John Reardon, and features Wareing throwing a brie across into the air <b>whilst</b> <b>standing</b> {{in the place of}} Simon the Zealot from Leonardo's work. In 2006, Marcus Wareing and Simon Rimmer represented the North of England in the BBC television series Great British Menu. Wareing beat the Manchester-based chef to go on to the final round.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the track {{was directed by}} Wayne Isham, who wanted it to show Spears [...] "out in nature". The video was filmed completely on location, {{with none of the}} scenes shot on green screens. The video primarily consists of Spears, whilst wearing cowboy boots, performing the song <b>whilst</b> <b>standing</b> {{on the edge of a}} cliff, and inside a cave: despite her [...] "trepidation" [...] and heavy winds which [...] "almost dropped [...] over", she performed the scene without a safety cable. Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not a blink of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but positive things to say about my experience with her and what she's doing right now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy. She ended up stepping out and kicking ass, There are 3 versions of the video, Version 1 and 2 has clips from the movie [...] "Crossroads" [...] and Version 3 is the original version." [...] The music video won the award for [...] "International Music Video of the Year Short-Form" [...] on the 2003 Japan Gold Disc Awards.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain in the 1930s, when Laura Henderson began {{presenting}} nude {{shows at}} the Windmill Theatre, London, the British law prohibited naked girls from moving. To get around the prohibition the models appeared in stationary tableaux vivants. [...] The Windmill girls also toured other London and provincial theatres, sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round, though strictly speaking, staying within {{the letter of the}} law by not moving of their own volition. Another example of the way the shows stayed within the law was the fan dance, in which a naked dancer's body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants, until the end of her act in when she posed nude for a brief interval <b>whilst</b> <b>standing</b> still.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain in the 1930s, {{when the}} Windmill Theatre, London, began to present nude shows, British law {{prohibited}} performers moving whilst {{in a state}} of nudity. [...] To get around that rule, models appeared naked in stationary tableaux vivants. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. Fan dances were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer's body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval <b>whilst</b> <b>standing</b> stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage. Changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho, with [...] "fully nude" [...] dancing and audience participation. Following the introduction of the Policing and Crime Act 2009, a local authority licence is required for venues in England and Wales (and later Scotland) where live nude entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year.|$|E
