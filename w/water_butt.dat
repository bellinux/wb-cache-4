His eldest son, {{who claimed to be}} a young man, had gone out by himself to explore the surroundings of the place, and one of the boys could not be found.

50|$|The oared tarida {{was able}} to be loaded and {{unloaded}} directly on a beach, using doors as loading ramps. In 1174 an Italo-Norman force attacked Alexandria with 1,500 horses transported on 36 tarides. Detailed specifications for thirteenth century tarides exist, showing they could carry 20-30 horses. In Angevin tarides, horses were stalled in threes, supported by canvas slings. Genoese tarides in 1246 carried 150 <b>water</b> <b>butts</b> containing 39,750 litres in total. Sailing transports, known as usciere in Italian (French huissiers; Latin usserii), were also built. These had two decks and could carry up to 100 horses.

Venetian usciere built for Louis IX in 1268 were 25.76m long, had a beam of 6.1m, had two decks and two masts.|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of artificial container habitats {{in urban areas}} has benefitted urban adaptable mosquito species globally. In areas where mosquitoes transmit viruses and parasites, it can promote vector population productivity and fuel mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. In Britain, storage of water in garden water butts is increasing, potentially expanding mosquito larval habitats and influencing population dynamics and mosquito-human contact. Here we show that the community composition, abundance and phenology of mosquitoes breeding in experimental <b>water</b> <b>butt</b> containers were influenced by urbanisation. Mosquitoes in urban containers were less species-rich but present in significantly higher densities (100. 4 ± 21. 3) per container than those in rural containers (77. 7 ± 15. 1). Urban containers were dominated by Culex pipiens (a potential vector of West Nile Virus [WNV]) and appear to be increasingly exploited by Anopheles plumbeus (a human-biting potential WNV and malaria vector). Culex phenology was influenced by urban land use type, with peaks in larval abundances occurring earlier in urban than rural containers. Among other factors, this was associated with an urban heat island effect which raised urban air and water temperatures by 0. 9 °C and 1. 2 °C respectively. Further increases in domestic water storage, particularly in urban areas, in combination with climate changes will likely alter mosquito population dynamics in the UK...|$|E
40|$|Background British {{mosquito}} population distribution, abundance, {{species composition}} and potential for mosquito disease transmission are intimately {{linked to the}} physical environment. The presence of ponds and water storage can significantly increase the density of particular mosquito species in the garden. Culex pipiens is the mosquito most commonly found in UK gardens and a potential vector of West Nile Virus WNV, although the current risk of transmission is low. However any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of C. pipiens are likely to impact subsequent risk of disease transmission. Pond dyes are used to control algal growth and improve aesthetics of still water reflecting surrounding planting. However, it is well documented that females of some species of mosquito prefer to lay eggs in dark water and/or containers of different colours and we predict that dyed ponds will be attractive to Culex mosquitoes. Methods Black pond dye was used in oviposition choice tests using wild-caught gravid C. pipiens. Larvae from wild-caught C. pipiens were also reared in the pond dye {{to determine whether it}} had any impact on survival. An emergence trap caught any adults that emerged from the <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>butts</b> (80  L) were positioned around university glasshouses and woodland and treated with black pond dye or left undyed. Weekly sampling over a six month period through summer and autumn was performed to quantified numbers of larvae and pupae in each treatment and habitat. Results Gravid female Culex mosquitoes preferred to lay eggs in dyed water. This was highly significant in tests conducted under laboratory conditions and in a semi-field choice test. Despite this, survivorship in black dyed water was significantly reduced compared to undyed water. Seasonal analysis of wild larval and pupal numbers in two habitats with and without dye showed no impact of dye but a significant impact of season and habitat. Mosquitoes were more successful, with significantly higher numbers of pupae, in the habitat where they had vegetation cover and shade. Discussion Our study has raised some interesting possibilities; one is that where used, pond dyes may be encouraging mosquitoes to breed in gardens in close proximity to people. Considering the concerns over potential future spread of disease in urban environments, this as well as shading of ponds and <b>water</b> <b>butts,</b> should inform future advice over reducing mosquito breeding and spread...|$|R
