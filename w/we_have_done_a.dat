500|$|A {{number of}} drivers {{competing}} in the 2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup entered the race optimistic about their chances of winning the championship. Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were [...] "capable of winning it". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that [...] "those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, {{and for the last}} four years <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> great job in that environment." [...] Hamlin commented, [...] "Reliability is the only thing we need to work on. It's taken us out of the last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion." [...] Ray Evernham also opined on Hamlin, [...] "I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship. I think that he's got focus right now and a good, veteran crew chief in Mike Ford. If Toyota gives him the speed, he could be a threat." ...|$|E

In a game against Portugal, Sanneh, playing right back, played a cross into the box which McBride put into the top corner. After the game, McBride mentioned, [...] "We joked {{about it in the}} locker room, it is a play <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> thousand times [...] [...] "I took a step in at the far post and lost my marker.

60|$|Now it was I {{understood}} why Simon Kenton had refrained from making any disagreeable remark when Paul told of our movements.

It is shown that the spin waves modes depend on both the thickness and modulation of the multilayers. The values of the spin-wave stiffness constant in multilayers are smaller than those obtained in crystalline and glassy alloys...|$|R
3000|$|It is {{impossible}} to ensure that an instrumental variable is absolutely independent of taste preferences. In practice, this restriction can be relaxed partly (Lewbel 2012). For example, some individual characteristics such as age and employment were used as X̃_i [...] in the Engel curve, and these variables were considered exogenous variables. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> overidentification test to exam the exogeneity. Details on this are given in the following part of the paper.|$|R

60|$|Ah, my friends, we {{are indeed}} Adam's children; and have learned his lesson, and {{inherited}} his nature only too fearfully well.

40|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> {{analysis}} of the total solar magnetic flux, polar coronal hole area and sunspots. We investigate their long term evolution over several solar cycles and their possible relationship with interplanetary shocks, sudden storm commencements at earth and cosmic ray variations. Our results stress a physical connection between solar magnetic flux emergence and interplanetary medium dynamics, in particular the importance of coronal hole evolution in the structuring of the heliosphere...|$|R
60|$|What it {{has taken}} minutes to write {{occurred}} in but a few seconds, but during that time Tars Tarkas had seen my plight and had dropped from the lower branches, which he had reached with such infinite labour, and as I flung {{the last of my}} immediate antagonists from me the great Thark leaped to my side, and again we fought, back to back, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> hundred times before.|$|R

40|$|To help in our wide-area {{application}} development, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> informal {{study of}} the relation between wide-area latency, the number of routers, and geographical distance between Internet sites. We did this by performing ping and traceroute measurements between 19 sites distributed across the globe. Contrary to our expectation there is almost no correlation between distance, latency, and number of routers in the current Internet. To help further studies of these characteristics the problems of this pilot project are also described. ...|$|R

30|$|Youth {{involvement}} in behaviors that violate social and/or legal norms, rules or conventions {{has been for}} long the subject of interest and research, within the most diverse theoretical approaches. Despite the existence of several Portuguese studies on this topic (e.g. Ferreira 1997; Fonseca 2004; Lemos 2010; Pechorro et al. 2013, 2014; Sanches et al. 2012), <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> extensive literature review and we could not find any publication addressing the validation or {{the analysis of the}} psychometric properties of a Portuguese scale to measure the deviant or delinquent behavior of adolescents.

30|$|Even {{though in}} this paper, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> initial {{analysis}} {{based on a}} real but relatively small network. As a future work, we plan to experiment and simulate with larger networks along with other 802.11 standards such as 802.11 n/g/a and to model the link delay and throughput along with the larger packet sizes, such as Jumbo frames. In addition, we plan to design and implement a complete routing protocol minimizing the total transmission delay and/or the total energy consumption based on the proposed generic algorithm and test it over real network deployments along with extensive simulations.|$|R

The major morbidity ranges from death to permanent impairment of vital organ functions (brain, eye, nose), infections, tissue losses, flap failures, treatment associated complications, psychosocial issues, and aesthesis besides others. This article is aimed at bringing forth these unfavorable results and how to avoid them...|$|R
