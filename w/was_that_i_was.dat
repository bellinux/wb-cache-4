500|$|When Anderson first {{wrote the}} episode, {{she did not}} hint that Scully and Mulder had had sex. Spotnitz and the {{production}} crew, however, felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder's relationship may have evolved into a romantic one. The idea of heart chakra crop circles was included because Anderson wanted [...] "whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from me, away from Washington, to somehow tie into what it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going through—the journey that I was going through". As such, Anderson dedicated {{much of her time}} researching both crop circles and heart chakras, but she later gave additional credit to Spotnitz, who she noted was also heavily involved during the researching process.|$|E

[...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the only one who wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I {{was the only one in}} opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

2500|$|As the 1970s wore on, Nicholson became {{increasingly}} disillusioned with football, {{in particular the}} increased player wages and the endemic hooliganism. He was appalled by the hooliganism he witnessed at the UEFA Cup final that Spurs lost to Feyenoord. Nicholson decided to resigned after a poor start to the 197475 season and losing 4–0 to Middlesbrough in the League Cup in September 1974. Nicholson later said of his resignation: [...] "The simple truth <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> burned out, I had no more to offer." [...] His tenure ended in acrimony as Nicholson wished to select for his replacement Danny Blanchflower as manager and Johnny Giles as player-coach, but Spurs chairman Sidney Wale was angered that Nicholson had contacted Giles and Blanchflower without his knowledge. Although Nicholson had intended {{to stay at the}} club as an advisor, the club chose to severe all ties with a £10,000 payoff and refused Nicholson a testimonial.|$|E
2500|$|On the anti-Tismăneanu side, the {{controversy}} involved political forces most {{often described as}} extremist, in particular the Greater Romania Party. Such groups have an ideological objection to Tismăneanu's condemnation of both fascism and national communism. Cristian Vasile, who argues that this meeting of extremes had already been predicted and verified by Tismăneanu's notion of [...] "baroque synthesis", specifically refers to a [...] "fowl-smelling rhetorical cocktail" [...] of neo-fascism or [...] "(Neo-)Legionary characteristics" [...] (in reference to the historical Iron Guard), neo-Stalinism and Protochronism, to {{be found at the}} source of [...] "media and historiographic ambuscades".

2500|$|To {{the general}} public, Wallace {{was best known}} as a {{panellist}} throughout the 27-year run of the BBC radio panel game My Music, from 1967 to 1994, not missing a single episode of more than 520 that were broadcast. John Amis, who appeared opposite Wallace in the series, remembered, [...] "There were many pleasurable things about being in My Music.... One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually paid every week to listen to Ian's singing: ballads, folksongs, straight songs and opera, he sang them all so that you could savour the words, and the actual sound was thrilling, a high bass-baritone with a marvellous, sonorous top F, a sound that went to the heart." [...] Occasionally Wallace would choose a rumbustious comic song, some of which he also included in his LP recordings, including [...] "The One Eyed Riley", [...] "I Can't Do My Bally Bottom Button Up", [...] "Never Do It at the Station", and the sewerman's song, [...] "Down Below".|$|E

[...] The Pride family moved to Great Falls, Montana, in 1967, because Pride's music career was taking off and he required quicker access to an airport. The family ultimately left Montana and moved to Texas in 1969. [...] In a 1967 interview with the Helena Independent Record, Rozene commented that the family encountered minor racism in Montana, citing an incident where they were refused service in a restaurant and another time when a realtor refused to show them a home, but she felt that the family endured less racism than she saw leveled against local Native American people, whose treatment she compared to that given to black people in the South. Pride has generally spoken with fondness of the near-decade he spent there. “Montana is a very conservative state...I stood out like a neon. But once they let you in, you become a Montanan.

Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States.

People died every day trying to defect.|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America.

And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff.

I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
2500|$|Seemingly finding {{parenting}} difficult, Henry Sr. mostly bonded {{with his}} son through their mutual fascination with history. After {{the death of his}} wife Anna from influenza, the gulf between father and son grew {{to the point where they}} rarely spoke. Henry claims that he taught his son [...] "self reliance" [...] this way, while Indiana felt that his father simply cared more about his intellectual pursuits than he did about his own son, saying [...] "What you taught me, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> less important to you than some people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country." [...] To Indiana's constant exasperation, Henry refers to his son only as [...] "Junior" [...] (ironically, Indiana does the same thing to his own son), until the end of The Last Crusade when he finally calls him [...] "Indiana". As he was not a hands-on father, Indiana resented his father's aloof, distant nature, which may have influenced his own inability to settle down and start a family for much of his life, and also resented his father's lifelong pursuit of the quest for the Holy Grail. When Henry explains that the search for the Grail is [...] "a race against evil", Indy lashes out at him: [...] "This is an obsession, Dad! I never understood it! Never!" [...] Because of aloofness as a father, Indy embraced his father's friend Marcus Brody as a father figure and role model. Another factor which deteriorated Indiana and Henry's relationship was Indiana going off to enlist in the Belgian Army for World War I in 1916 without his father's consent, and the two went three years without seeing each other.|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less.

I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quiet <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thinking of nothing at all.
