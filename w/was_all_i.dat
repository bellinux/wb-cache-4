500|$|In {{addition}} to the tired former prisoners and civilians, {{the majority of the}} Rangers had only slept for five to six hours over the past three days. The soldiers frequently had hallucinations or fell asleep as they marched. Benzedrine was distributed by the medics to keep the Rangers active during the long march. One Ranger commented on the effect of the drug: [...] "It felt like your eyes were popped open. You couldn't have closed them if you wanted to. One pill <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ever took—it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ever needed." ...|$|E
500|$|Charmayne James {{was born}} on June 23, 1970, in Boerne, Texas, {{and grew up in}} Clayton, New Mexico. She started riding horses at age three. By age six, she was running barrels. She said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do." [...] She began her rodeo career by joining the Rabbit Ear 4-H Club. Customarily, barrel racing is the only event that women compete in at Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) {{sponsored}} events, and it is the second most popular event after bull riding.|$|E

[...] After travelling at 400mph (644km/h), the 67-year-old Frenchman said [...] "C'était magnifique... It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ever dreamed of in aviation—no propellers, no vibration." [...] The Daily Mail entertained him at the Royal Aero Club in London, where he was accompanied by his former rival, Claude Grahame-White.|$|E

500|$|Back then I didn't {{realize the}} power of my character. [...] I didn't realize the image I had created and {{what it meant to}} so many people. [...] Ruth was so underwritten, so what I was able to bring to it was what made it special to me. [...] The looks, the affection, the pats on the head, the tone and inflection. [...] I got to bring that to her character, and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> thought there was. [...] I didn't know what was being {{received}} {{on the other side of}} the screen.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{enrolled}} at Ryerson University School of Theatre in Toronto to further improve his acting. He left Ryerson in 1985, {{several months before}} graduating, [...] to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, where he spent five seasons performing. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> wanted, to be a classical actor {{for the rest of}} my life, but during the last couple of years I was there, I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E

500|$|Closely {{associated}} with the now unpopular disco and having had no hit singles in the preceding few years, after leaving Fantasy Sylvester was not a particular draw for major record labels. Recognizing this state of affairs, in 1982 Sylvester commented that [...] "there's nothing worse than a fallen star" [...] who still has [...] "illusions" [...] of their continuing fame. Rather than chasing major chart success, Sylvester wanted to focus on retaining creative control over his music. Hiring his former tour manager and longstanding friend Tim McKenna as his new manager, Sylvester decided to produce his next album with Megatone Records, a small San Francisco company that had been founded in 1981 by Patrick Cowley and Marty Blecman and which catered largely to the gay club scene. The result <b>was</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> Need (1982), on which James Wirrick had written most of the songs, which were dance-orientated and influenced by the new wave music then in vogue. Sylvester insisted that he include several ballads on the album, which featured cover art by Mark Amerika depicting Sylvester in ancient Egyptian garb.|$|E
500|$|In the 1934 NFL Championship Game, the Giants {{defeated}} previously unbeaten Chicago 30–13 at the Polo Grounds on an icy {{field with}} temperatures peaking at 25 degrees. Before the game, team treasurer John Mara talked with Owen and team captain Flaherty about the field conditions. Flaherty suggested the Giants wear sneakers {{on the frozen}} field, as he had played in a game under similar circumstances at Gonzaga, and the sneakers proved to be effective. Mara dispatched equipment manager Abe Cohen {{to get as many}} sneakers as he could get. Due to traffic and the inability to find any athletic goods stores open on Sunday, Cohen was unable to return before the game started, and the Giants, wearing conventional footwear, trailed 10–3 {{at the end of the}} first half. Realizing time was short, Cohen went to Manhattan College — where he had a key to the equipment and locker rooms — and returned to the Polo Grounds at halftime with nine pairs of basketball sneakers, saying that [...] "nine pairs <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could get." [...] Players donned the sneakers and New York, after allowing Chicago another field goal late in the 3rd quarter, responded with 27 unanswered points in the 4th quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. The game would come to be known as [...] "The Sneakers Game", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the 4th quarter set a single–quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades. After the game, offensive tackle Len Grant expressed his sincere gratitude by stating [...] "God bless Abe Cohen." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{they signed}} McBride, {{who had spent}} the 1934 season playing on a semi-pro team, before the game, the Western Division {{champion}} Bears were still 2½–1 favorites. The Giants defeated the previously unbeaten Bears, however, 30–13 at the Polo Grounds on an icy field with temperatures peaking at 25degrees. Before the game, team treasurer John Mara talked with Owen and captain Ray Flaherty about the frozen field conditions.

[...] Players donned the sneakers and the Giants, after allowing the Bears another field goal late in the third period, responded with 27 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. When they took the lead 17–13 on a touchdown run by Strong, the game had to be stopped because hundreds of fans ran onto the field to celebrate. The game would come to be known as [...] "The Sneakers Game", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the fourth quarter set a single-quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades. Fans converged on the field after the game, tearing down one of the goal posts. After the game offensive tackle Len Grant expressed his gratitude, saying [...] "God bless Abe Cohen." [...] Oddly, the team's performance was also aided by the consumption of alcohol. The team's trainer felt that whiskey could warm the players up, and he put some into their paper cups. Strong scored a touchdown on the next play, and the trainer did the same thing on the next drive, which again ended in a touchdown. Fearing drunkenness, water was returned to their cups once the team had the lead,.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at my desk {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, but it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd {{keep coming back to}} my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E

All I did all day long was skateboard. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly how hard I had to work in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E

2500|$|Of his youth, Morrissey said, [...] "Pop music <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ever had, {{and it was}} {{completely}} entwined {{with the image of}} the pop star. I remember feeling the person singing was actually with me and understood me and my predicament." [...] He later revealed that the first record he purchased was Marianne Faithfull's 1964 single [...] "Come and Stay With Me". During the 1970s he became a glam rock fan, enjoying the work of British acts like T-Rex, David Bowie, and Roxy Music. He was also a fan of American glam performers Sparks, Jobriath, and most significantly The New York Dolls, the latter of whom he discovered after seeing them give a television performance in 1973. The Dolls were a significant influence on Morrissey, {{to the extent that he}} organised a British fan club for the band through small adverts in the back pages of music magazines. It was through the Dolls' interest in female pop singers from the 1960s that Morrissey too developed a fascination for such artists, who included Sandie Shaw, Twinkle, and Dusty Springfield.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had just {{announced}} British withdrawal, addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler's downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring thirty-five minute speech described by Enoch Powell as [...] "one of the most horrible things that I remember in politics … (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old actor manager succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting." [...] He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be [...] "Greeks in the Roman Empire", and according to Philip Goodhart's recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote [...] "I held the Tory Party for the weekend, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> intended to do". Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) {{that he planned to}} retire and go to the Lords.

2500|$|My Own Prison {{had been}} {{circulating}} around {{the music industry}} for a while when, in May 1997, Diana Meltzer from Wind-Up Records heard the album {{for the first time}} and decided almost immediately that she wanted to sign them to the label, which had recently dropped Baboon over the latter's reluctance to alter their image and sound to suit the label's demands. Meltzer later said that she heard [...] "an arena band". Within the same week, Meltzer, together with Wind-up president Steve Lerner, CEO Alan Meltzer, and A representative Joel Mark, flew to Tallahassee to see Creed perform live and decide for certain whether to offer them a contract. [...] "Seeing the energy in the room when Scott Stapp stepped up to the mike, and hearing his powerful voice fill the room, alongside Mark Tremonti’s now legendary guitar riffs and that big Creed anthemic rock sound, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> needed," [...] she told HitQuarters. According to Hanson, before Wind-up signed Creed, fourteen labels had already passed on the band, and at one point he was tempted to take charge of them himself.|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
