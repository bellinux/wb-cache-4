25|$|The helmet {{is usually}} made of two main parts: the bonnet, which covers the diver's head, and the corselet which {{supports}} {{the weight of}} the helmet on the diver's shoulders, and is clamped to the suit to create a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal.</b> The bonnet is attached and sealed to the corselet at the neck, either by bolts or an interrupted screw-thread, with some form of locking mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Attachment rings allow {{separate}} neck seals, gloves, and (less commonly) {{boots to}} be joined to the suit with a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal.</b> The older style attachment ring system uses a support ring inside the suit and a clamping band outside the suit to tightly hold the suit and the separate hood/boot/glove together. They were also used with the neck seals of some old British frogman-type dry suits.|$|E
25|$|The Plane was {{designed}} by Gordon Cale Thomas, after a large-scale prototype was built at the company's Bulbourne yard and he had assessed the 75ft climb. It had two tanks, or caissons, each capable of holding two narrowboats or a barge. The caissons were full of water, and so balanced each other. The caissons' vertical guillotine gates created a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal.</b> The lift was powered by a 25-horsepower (19kW) stationary steam engine. The land for the Plane was purchased for £1,595 and total expenses for the project came to £39,244 by 24 June 1900.|$|E

25|$|Most bonnets {{are joined}} to the corselet by 1/8th turn {{interrupted}} thread. The helmet neck thread is placed onto {{the neck of}} the corselet facing the divers left front, where the threads do not engage, and then rotated forward, engaging the thread and seating on a leather gasket to make a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal.</b> The helmet usually has a safety lock which prevents the bonnet from rotating back and separating underwater. Other styles of connection are also used, with the joint secured by clamps or bolts (usually three). Some helmets were made with the bonnet and corselet in one piece and secured to the suit in other ways.|$|E
500|$|As built, Bennington was [...] {{in length}} and [...] abeam. Her steel hull had an average draft of , which was {{expected}} {{to give her the}} ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water. At the waterline was a turtleback deck of ⅜-inch (9.5mm) steel that formed a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal</b> over the lower spaces. The deck had a crown {{at the level of the}} waterline and curved downwards to [...] below the waterline at the sides of the ship. Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads; the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle.|$|E
500|$|Although {{a gifted}} {{engineer}} Brindley had {{no formal education}} and rarely, if ever, committed his designs to paper. When questioned by the parliamentary committee about {{the composition of the}} puddle he frequently referred to in his evidence, he had a mass of clay brought into the committee room. He then formed the clay into a trough and showed how it would only form a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal</b> if it had been worked with water to form puddle. [...] "Thus it is" [...] said Brindley [...] "that I form a watertight-trunk to carry water over rivers and valleys wherever they cross the path of the canal." [...] Later, when asked to produce a drawing of the bridge or aqueduct he proposed to build, he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model. He then went out and bought a large round of Cheshire cheese, which he divided into two equal halves saying [...] "Here is my model". Then, to the amusement of the committee, he used the two halves of cheese to represent the semicircular arches and laid a long, rectangular object over the top to demonstrate the position of the river flowing under the aqueduct and the canal flowing over it.|$|E

500|$|Monitors turret {{measured}} [...] {{in diameter}} and [...] high, constructed with [...] of armor (11 inches in front at the gun ports) rendering the overall vessel somewhat top heavy. Its rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot. A pair of donkey engines rotated the turret {{through a set of}} gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made. The only way to see out of the turret was through the gun ports; when the guns were not in use, or withdrawn for reloading during battle, heavy iron port stoppers would swing down into place to close the gunports. Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate. The spindle was [...] in diameter which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways. When not in use, the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal.</b> In service, however, this proved to leak heavily, despite caulking by the crew. [...] The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several s, which used the same turret design, during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle, which could also jam the turret. To gain access to the turret from below, or to hoist up powder and shot during battle, the turret had to rotate facing directly to starboard, which would line up the entry hatch in the floor of the turret with an opening in the deck below. The roof of the turret was lightly built to facilitate any needed exchange of the ship's guns and to improve ventilation, with only gravity holding the roof plates in place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mouthpiece}} is a {{part that}} the user grips in the mouth to make a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal.</b> It is a short flattened-oval tube that goes in between the lips, with a curved flange that fits between the lips and the teeth and gums. On the inner ends of the flange there are two tabs with enlarged ends, which are gripped between the teeth. Most recreational diving regulators are fitted with a mouthpiece. In twin-hose regulators and rebreathers, [...] "mouthpiece" [...] may refer to the whole assembly between the two flexible tubes. A mouthpiece prevents clear speech, so a full-face mask is preferred where voice communication is needed.|$|E
2500|$|Diving masks {{may have}} a single, durable, {{tempered}} glass faceplate, or two lenses {{in front of the}} eyes. These may be supported by a relatively rigid plastic or metal frame, or they may be permanently bonded to the rim of the skirt, in a construction known as [...] "frameless". In the case of freediving masks, which need to have a low internal volume to minimize the amount of breath needed to equalize the change of pressure that occurs with depth, the lenses may be made of polycarbonate plastic. There is usually a [...] "skirt" [...] of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer to support the frame and lenses and create a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal</b> with the diver's face.|$|E
50|$|Plumber's putty {{is a type}} of putty used as a sealant in plumbing. It is a pliable {{substance}} used to make <b>watertight</b> <b>seals</b> around faucets and drains. The putty is a {{basic component}} of a plumber's toolkit and is often used when replacing plumbing fixtures. Plumber's putty formulations vary but commonly include powdered clay and linseed oil. Other formulas use limestone, talc, or fish oil. RTV silicone or epoxy sealants may be used in place of putty.|$|R

5000|$|Silicone: The most {{commonly}} found adhesive in optical bonding processes {{that dates back}} to the 1970s as a solution. Silicone's core properties of low conductivity and chemical reactivity, thermal stability, and ability to repel water and form <b>watertight</b> <b>seals</b> make it a common solution for optical bonding. Also, because it is a soft material, it is very feasible to rework for bonds that become damaged over time. However, debris often forms {{around the edges of the}} bonds if they are rubbed during handling. To reduce this, edges of optically bonded displays should be covered or configured so that edges are not exposed.|$|R
2500|$|More recently, on both {{commercial}} and recreational suits, [...] "quick-change" [...] rings {{have become increasingly}} common. These are permanently glued to the suit and accessories, either during manufacture or as a retrofit. These systems form a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal</b> between the suit and components using soft rings on both pieces that comprise a series of interlocking channels, similar in principle to a common food storage bag. Quick-change rings allow a diver to easily replace a damaged seal on the surface with no tools or adhesives, or to change attachments depending on conditions–for example, choosing between dry gloves and standard wrist seals. Different manufacturers' ring systems are generally incompatible, so the diver must choose accessories that are designed for the ring system {{on his or her}} suit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. [...] This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto dump, valve on the shoulder. [...] Automatic valves can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the automatic valve at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no dump valve, but are clamped to the helmet with a <b>watertight</b> <b>seal,</b> so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a dump valve. Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist seals or the neck seal open to vent the suit.|$|E

40|$|In {{industrial}} assembly lines, seam sealing is {{a painting}} process used for making <b>watertight</b> <b>seals</b> or for preventing rusting. In the process, sealant is painted on seams {{located at the}} joints of pressed metal parts. We developed a sealing robot system that adjusts the sealing gun motion adaptively to the seam position sensed by a range sensor (a scanning laser rangefinder which senses profile range data). In this paper, we propose a high-speed and highly reliable algorithm for seam position computation from the sensed profile range data around the seam. It is proved experimentally that the sealing robot system used with the developed algorithm is very effective, especially for reducing wasted sealant. ...|$|R
50|$|The AMC was a two-bay biplane {{flying boat}} with an {{aluminum}} hull. The spruce woodspar wings were fabric covered with small tip floats for stability. The engine was mounted {{just below the}} top wing in a pusher configuration with a forward-mounted radiator. Two 50-gallon streamlined main fuel tanks sat on the top wing {{on either side of}} the engine with a 70-gallon fuselage-mounted reserve. The hull was constructed of eighteen forms and five watertight bulkheads. It had two rows of small bench seats for passengers in the front. The pilot and mechanic sat slightly raised in individual open cockpits behind the passengers, beneath the main wing. The hull used Alcoa 17S aluminum treated with potassium nitrate with Canton flannel/Asphalt <b>watertight</b> <b>seals</b> and Valspar aluminum paint.|$|R

50|$|The Caterpillar design {{did well}} in testing, and in 1960 the company was awarded a multimillion-dollar {{contract}} for developing eight 8-ton cargo trucks, delivered in 1961 and 1962, {{as well as two}} 10-ton wreckers and two 2500-gallon tankers in 1962. Another twenty-three units were ordered in 1963, and field-tested in Germany in 1964, and later in Vietnam in 1966. Not until 1971 did Caterpillar eventually receive a production contract for 1300 units: 812 M520 cargo-vehicles, 371 M559 tankers and 117 M553 wreckers. Production began in 1972 and lasted through June 1976. When fitted with its own crane, the cargo variant would be designated M877.Not only did the Caterpillar offer extreme off-road ability, including 20° longitudinal articulation and 30° side-slopes, it was also fully amphibious, using the wheels for propulsion in the water. The rear cargo-bed tailgate and drop-side doors, that allowed rapid discharge of cargo, had <b>watertight</b> <b>seals</b> to preserve the unit's swimming capability. In the US’s involvement in the Vietnam War, the Goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not, {{and it was one of}} the preferred resupply vehicles after the pre-production units' introduction in 1966.

2500|$|Semi-dry {{suits are}} {{effectively}} a thick wetsuit with nearly <b>watertight</b> <b>seals</b> at wrist, neck and ankles and zip. They are typically used {{where the water}} temperature is between [...] The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a close fit minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit's insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with slick inside surface neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals [...] Two-piece sets {{tend to be a}} one piece full length suit, sometimes described as [...] "long johns", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.|$|R
