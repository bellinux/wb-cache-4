5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire {{side of the ship}} needed to be armored, even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt. They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals. This system likely <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E

25|$|Storace <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> {{closely with}} Mozart on The Marriage of Figaro; it is {{possible}} that her lively acting style was the inspiration for the central character of Susanna.

The Miscanti Line dissects the Quaternary basement beneath Lascar, {{and it may}} be a hinge of a fold that is being propagated by faults. The formation of the first cone at Lascar may have been facilitated by the intersection between the Miscanti Line and another east–west lineament formed by Pliocene–Pleistocene tectonic compression of the region, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> as an ascent path for magma.

25|$|American {{designer}} MacDuffy {{constructed the}} first suit to use ball bearings to provide joint movement in 1914; it was tested in New York {{to a depth}} of , but was not very successful. A year later, Harry L. Bowdoin of Bayonne, New Jersey, made an improved ADS with oil-filled rotary joints. The joints use a small duct to the interior of the joint to allow equalization of pressure. The suit was designed to have four joints in each arm and leg, and one joint in each thumb, for a total of eighteen. Four viewing ports and a chest-mounted lamp were intended to assist underwater vision. Unfortunately {{there is no evidence that}} Bowdoin's suit was ever built, or that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> if it had been.|$|E
25|$|Todd Park, the U.S. chief {{technology}} officer, initially said on October 6 that the glitches {{were caused by}} unexpected high volume when the site drew 250,000 simultaneous users instead of the 50,000-60,000 expected. He claimed that the site <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> with fewer simultaneous users. More than 8.1 million people visited the site from October 1 to 4. White House officials subsequently conceded {{that it was not}} just an issue of volume, but involved software and systems design issues. For example, consumers are required to create an account before being able to compare plans, and the registration process may have created a bottleneck that led to the long wait times. Also, stress tests done by contractors 1 day before the launch date revealed that the site became too slow with only 1,100 simultaneous users, nowhere near even the 50,000-60,000 expected.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known relative on her mother's side is her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields (1844-1938), who {{was held}} {{as a slave}} {{on a farm in}} Clayton County, North Georgia. Her master was Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm near Rex. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> along with his slaves. Melvinia became pregnant at about age 15 and had a biracial son, Dolphus T. Shields, born into slavery about 1860. Melvinia did not talk to relatives about his father. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said the father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. After the Civil War, Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama. Charles later became a teacher and married a white woman. Michelle Obama's extended family has said that people didn't talk about slavery time while they were growing up. Michelle Obama's distant ancestry also includes Irish and other European roots.|$|E
25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E
25|$|This left John Parkin, {{the local}} {{architect}} who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> with the American Bunshaft, to design Toronto-Dominion Centre. His firm {{put forward a}} model showing a 100-storey, all-concrete tower—to be {{the largest in the}} Commonwealth—standing over a plaza with a sunken courtyard containing a circular banking pavilion. It was at this point that Phyllis Lambert insisted that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (whom she knew from having been the director of planning on his Seagram Building) be called for an interview. Mies was unimpressed by Parkin's concept and wondered why one would design a building to be entered through its basement. With this, the Parkin proposal was scrapped and Allen Lambert was convinced to bring Mies on board. Though he was technically commissioned as the design consultant to the local architects (who were still John B. Parkin and Associates, but partnered with Bregman + Hamann Architects), the project was essentially Mies' design in its entirety, demonstrating all the key characteristics of the architect's unique style.|$|E
