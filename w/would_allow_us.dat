5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
25|$|Other 'deterministic' {{theories}} actually seek only {{to highlight}} {{the importance of a}} particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to make perfect predictions.|$|E
25|$|In his 2005 book, The Singularity is Near, Kurzweil {{suggests}} that medical advances would {{allow people to}} protect their bodies {{from the effects of}} aging, making the life expectancy limitless. Kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to continuously repair and replace defective components in our bodies, prolonging life to an undetermined age. Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. Kurzweil suggests somatic gene therapy; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.|$|E

25|$|Although {{macroscopic}} {{concepts are}} essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics {{has been devoted to}} the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} speech, McKinley urged {{an end to}} American isolationism. [...] He {{proposed}} trade arrangements which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>US</b> manufacturers new markets. [...] "The period of exclusiveness is past. [...] The expansion of our trade and commerce is the pressing problem. [...] Commercial wars are unprofitable." [...] The crowd greeted his speech with loud applause; at its conclusion, the President escorted Ida McKinley back to her carriage as she was {{to return to the}} Milburn House while he saw the sights at the fair.|$|E

2500|$|The major {{territorial}} losses {{resulted in}} Carol's fall from power, and inaugurated the National Legionary State, with Ion Antonescu as Conducător. Initially, this regime followed Nazi policy, and prevented the more obvious displays of Bessarabian unionism, leading Pântea to exclaim: [...] "General Antonescu [...] cannot speak {{his mind on}} all subjects, so hopefully he <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to discuss and to shout out the issue of our justice". In May, shortly after the Antonescu regime had restructured itself (see Legionary Rebellion), Pântea entered a dispute {{with other members of}} the Bessarabian Circle, and resigned from the post of Vice President.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, 25,000 Palestinian {{teenagers}} learned [...] "kidnapping, ambushing {{and using}} assault weapons" [...] at {{a summer camp}} run by Yassir Arafat's staff who deal with psychological warfare. Lt. General Shaul Mofaz, the IDF's Chief of the General Staff, regarded the camps as [...] "evidence of the risks of a new Palestinian upheaval". The Arafat aide who oversees the camps compared the camps to the Israeli Gadna corps for teenagers and said [...] "We hope that we will achieve our rights through negotiations, so that summer camps like these will cease to exist. ... There is nothing we want more than a full and genuine peace, including Jerusalem, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to end the weapons-training and concentrate instead on teaching our young people about computers, and swimming and other recreations." ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{desirable}} {{to be able}} to combine ease of implemen-tation of a network with the ability to analyze the prop-erties of the network. In order to address this we present a MAC protocol where the network acts as a FIFO, and examine the resulting properties of the network using both a theoretical study of the waiting times and a simulation experiment. It turns out that this type of protocol <b>would</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to achieve real-time guarantees for an event-triggered system, as well as controlled jitter for message delivery. Further, temporal composability, and how to de-sign a system using FIFO networking, is discussed. 1...|$|R

25|$|Considering Padilla {{was held}} for years in {{military}} custody with no formal charges, many observers were shocked by the charges finally brought by the Bush presidential administration.

2500|$|... "If you flew wisely, the P-40 was a {{very capable}} aircraft. [...] could outturn a P-38, a fact that some pilots didn't realize when they made the {{transition}} between the two aircraft. [...] The real problem with it was lack of range. As we pushed the Japanese back, P-40 pilots were slowly {{left out of the}} war. So when I moved to P-38s, an excellent aircraft, I did not [...] that the P-40 was an inferior fighter, but because I knew the P-38 <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to reach the enemy. I was a fighter pilot and that was what I was supposed to do." [...] The 8th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 49th, 343rd and 347th PGs/FGs, flew P-40s in the Pacific theaters between 1941 and 1945, with most units converting to P-38s from 1943–44. In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed forward air controllers during ground operations in the Philippines, until it received delivery of P-51s. They claimed 655 aerial victories.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There have been a lot of games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know where things are going. We felt that a fresh start <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to have the freedom to do new and interesting things to keep the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Triumph of Bohr" [...] {{consisted}} in his demonstrating, once again, that Einstein's subtle {{argument was}} not conclusive, {{but even more}} so {{in the way that}} he arrived at this conclusion by appealing precisely to one of the great ideas of Einstein: the principle of equivalence between gravitational mass and inertial mass, together with the time dilation of special relativity, and a consequence of these--the Gravitational redshift. Bohr showed that, in order for Einstein's experiment to function, the box would have to be suspended on a spring {{in the middle of a}} gravitational field. In order to obtain a measurement of the weight of the box, a pointer would have to be attached to the box which corresponded with the index on a scale. After the release of a photon, a mass [...] could be added to the box to restore it to its original position and this <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to determine the energy [...] that was lost when the photon left. The box is immersed in a gravitational field of strength , and the gravitational redshift affects the speed of the clock, yielding uncertainty [...] in the time [...] required for the pointer to return to its original position. Bohr gave the following calculation establishing the uncertainty relation [...]|$|E
