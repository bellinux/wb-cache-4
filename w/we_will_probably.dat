25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s out there that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{reviews of}} the design were {{strongly}} positive. [...] Washington Post architectural critic Wolf von Eckardt called it [...] "a work of architecture <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be proud of" [...] in November 1964, {{and said it was}} [...] "a design that promises to work – practically and aesthetically." [...] A year later, Von Eckardt compared the building's light-colored concrete (which he called sculptural) to the classic white marble of D.C.'s most beloved monuments, and said the Forrestal Building's style [...] "may herald a new Federal architecture." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 March 2013, Ewen {{confirmed}} the Sugababes would record new music [...] "before {{the end of}} the year", stating: [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> come back together again at {{the end of the}} year. There will definitely be more recording but, there is no release date anytime soon." [...] On 16 May 2013 Amelle Berrabah revealed that the group had been writing new material for their new album and hoped to release new music in 2014. However, fellow member Jade Ewen later expressed her feelings towards the group's future being uncertain, stating the group are [...] "pretty much done", which led to reports suggesting the group have split. Controversy over the group's future arose when Berrabah stated she believed the group will get back together in late 2014, therefore it is unsure what the band's future intentions are.|$|E

The principle of an association rule {{is similar to}} the algorithmic instruction of choice IF… THEN.|$|R
2500|$|On {{his return}} to the US Cropper spoke to online Memphis radio station AllMemphisMusic about the tour, [...] "There was a little {{apprehension}} about us going down to play behind him, because the people who were fans were there to see Guy. Well they were there {{to see some of the}} old Memphis guys as well. And that comradre with everybody, and hearing him singing our music, which was born and raised and produced and recorded in Memphis Tennessee. It was just something I, it's hard to explain the excitement coming from being on stage and that excitement coming out of the audience. It just filled our hearts. Because they really liked us, and they really liked that good old Memphis music, and here's one of the biggest Idols singing that music. It's just pretty much an overwhelming experience that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never ever get over. I hope some way we can do it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ginsberg has {{commented on}} {{campaign}} strategies; for example, {{he suggested that}} a photo of young Bill Clinton shaking the hand of President John F. Kennedy, taken by photographer Arnold Sachs, was used by campaign operatives to reinforce the idea of Clinton as [...] "heir apparent" [...] to the Kennedy legacy. He also commented on the tight presidential primary race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008, and compared the two candidates to [...] "WalMart and Kmart – they’re occupying the same space." [...] Ginsberg has a cynical outlook, seeing the Republican Party as courting Jews not for their votes but for their financial contributions. He was quoted as saying: [...] "When the numbers are added up, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> find that Jewish money was especially important to the Republicans this year." [...] In another instance, Ginsberg criticized the administration of FDR for the tactic of having federal investigators sift through tax and financial records of opposition politicians. He's known for speaking bluntly about religious politics: for example, he said [...] "Jews {{have always been the}} brains, the wallet and the legs of the Democratic Party," [...] in an interview in 2002. Ginsberg participated in panel discussions about polling and democracy.|$|E

The mademoiselles whom <b>we</b> meet <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> {{have their}} own sweethearts. Somehow, to-night I fancy that we shall be lookers-on. What does it matter? We shall at least see life. We shall catch the shadows of other people's happinesses. It is, I believe, the sincerest form. The chicken, dear Julien,--what of the chicken?" ...|$|R

In April 2010, he stated, [...] "Some reports {{are saying that the}} Life's Too Short pilot we are shooting in the summer will be aired. It wont [...] It is a non-broadcast pilot. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> shoot the whole series before anything is aired. We're not sure how many eps episodes <b>we</b> <b>will</b> record (<b>probably</b> 6) and not sure when the series will air." ...|$|R
60|$|Your letter {{ought to}} have been much earlier acknowledged, and would have been so, had I not been sure you would ascribe my silence to its true cause, viz. procrastination, and not to {{indifference}} to your kind attention. There was another feeling which both urged and indisposed me to write to you,--I mean the allusion which, in so friendly a manner, you make to a supposed change in my political opinions. To the scribblers in pamphlets and periodical publications who have heaped so much obloquy upon myself and my friends Coleridge and Southey, I have not condescended to reply, nor ever shall; but to you, my candid and enlightened friend, I will say a few words on this subject, which, if we have the good fortune to meet again, as I hope <b>we</b> may, <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be further dwelt upon.|$|R

"It {{is lucky}} she didn't carry a small gun in her bows," [...] Vincent said, [...] "for though {{seven or eight}} hundred yards is a long range for a rifle, they might likely enough have hit us if they had had a gun. Now, Tony, we shall have to be careful, for those {{whistles}} are no doubt meant as an alarm; and although she cannot tell who <b>we</b> are, she <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> steam up, {{and if they have}} any forces opposite Bermuda will give them news that two suspicious characters have landed, and they will have parties out to look for us." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the coming}} years <b>we</b> <b>will</b> most <b>probably</b> watch a {{significant}} increase of the BIM (building information model) utilization in the AEC (Architecture/Engineering/Construction) sector even in the Czech Republic. Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider possible utilization of the well-established geographic information systems within the building information modelling process. This paper {{is based on the}} currently existing literature and is focused on the interrelationship between BIM and GIS. The main goal is to reveal potential fields of cooperation and to find possible utilization of GIS in BIM. To provide a theoretical framework, this article briefly introduces and defines the term of BIM and deals with the most important semantic models in AEC and 3 D GIS IFC and CityGML. The paper also contains examples of specific efforts recently dealing with the BIM and GIS collaboration. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Focusing on the uncollected issues, Checker's {{collections}} do {{not start}} {{at the beginning of the}} various series', starting at between Volume 3 and Volume 6, and following directly from the previously-published volumes released by CrossGen. Thompson stated that Checker was (as of July 2007) [...] "strongly considering more collections and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> approach Disney with a proposal", qualifying this two weeks later as hopefully ultimately producing [...] "catch up" [...] "omnibus collections that have issues collected in one place to compliment the new volumes for storyline completeness." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Platform Sutra {{underwent}} various redactions.

The Dunhuang version of the text, the earliest complete edition we have, is almost certainly a product of a long evolution with elements coming together from several different Chan groups with different agendas, as the uneven character of the text and its internal inconsistencies attest.|$|E
30|$|Second, we {{applied to}} jobs advertised on the Swedish Public Employment Office website. Even {{though this is}} the most common channel for job search, it does not {{represent}} the entire labor market in Sweden. If ex-offenders have more or less difficulties in finding a job through other channels than the Swedish public Employment Office website, then <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> under- or overestimate, respectively, the magnitude of discrimination. Hence, caution should be taken in interpreting the magnitude of discrimination and generalizing the results to the entire market.|$|R

In a recently accepted paper submitted to electrophoresis we have demonstrated capability to perform a complete genotype including extraction, amplification (16 min) and separation (2 min) in under 25 min. I am curious as to how these protocols would work with more difficult samples such as bone. To do this <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> combine ultra high pressure or magnetic bead based extraction, ministrs, fast polymerase, and microfluidics to achieve our results...|$|R
5000|$|After {{reviewing}} the controversy as regards possible plagiarism he suggests: [...] "Unless new documents emerge, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> {{never be able}} to establish with complete certainty whether Nietzsche plagiarized from Stirner. The circumstantial evidence provided by the published writings is strong, but only if one glosses over the many differences in the published writings as well. ... Nevertheless, I know of no other example of two philosophers whose works bear such a strong similarity, but where no debt of acknowledgement took place". Following Löwith, he concludes by offering the idea that Nietzsche most likely arrived at ideas similar to Stirner's because of the [...] "inevitable logic of post-Hegelian philosophy".|$|E
5000|$|In the January 1, 2002, {{issue of}} Fire Engineering, an article co-written by Dunn {{regarding}} {{the collapse of}} the three World Trade Center towers stated, [...] "Now, with that understanding, you would think we would have the largest fire investigation in world history. You would be wrong. Instead, we have a series of unconnected and uncoordinated superficial inquiries. No comprehensive 'Presidential Blue Ribbon Commission'. No top-notch National Transportation Safety Board-like response. Ironically, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> gain more detailed information about the destruction of the planes than we will about the destruction of the towers. We are literally treating the steel removed from the site like garbage, not like crucial fire scene evidence." ...|$|E

Following Margiela's departure, the anonymous design team continued to design the label, with no single creative director in place. CEO Giovanni Pungetti stated that [...] "we want to stay avant-garde, and provocative, but without a new creative director. It’s a challenge. We know this. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> make mistakes, {{but the most important thing}} is to learn from them."

40|$|Remote sensing {{technology}} {{allows us to}} recognize manifestations of regional thresholds, especially in the spatial characteristics of process agents. For example, a change in river channel pattern over a short distance reflects a threshold alteration in the physical controls of discharge and/or sediment. It is, therefore, a valuable indication of conditions as they exist. However, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> have difficulty determining whether the systemic parameters are now close to threshold conditions at which a different change will occur. This, of course, is a temporal and magnitude problem which is difficult to solve from the spatial characteristics...|$|R
