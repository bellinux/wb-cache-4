40|$|Summary. Many aquatic species use chemosensory {{information}} to assess predation risk. The cues used in such risk assessment can come {{either from the}} predator (predator odour) or from injured prey (alarm cues). The information conveyed through chemicals may, however, be inaccurate both spatially and temporally, as chemicals may persist in the environment long after the predator is gone. Thus, the level of accuracy of the cues for risk assessment may depend on the persistency of the chemicals in the habitat. Here, we investigated the persistency of alarm cues of a larval amphibian, the <b>woodfrog</b> (Rana sylvatica) in a ephemeral pond, their natural habitat. We introduced either alarm cues or control water in enclosed sleeves (∼ 10 L) installed in the pond. The sleeve water was then sampled after 5 min and every two hours for eight hours. We used the behavioural response of <b>woodfrog</b> tadpoles to alarm cues as a bioassay to assess how long the alarm cues persisted in the environment. We found that tadpoles responded with an antipredator response to the pond water containing alarm cues 5 min after the injection of the cues in the sleeves but {{did not respond to}} that same pond water after two hours. Our results indicate that biodegradation and/or photodegradation of alarm cues in natural habitats might occur relatively quickly as the loss of a response to the cues in our experiment was independent of a dilution effect. This contrasts with previous laboratory results indicating that chemicals may be active after several hours. Key words.

40|$|For prey {{species that}} rely on {{learning}} to recognize their predators, natural selection should favour individuals able to learn as early as possible. The earliest point at which individuals can gather information about the identity of their potential predators is during the embryonic stage. Indeed, recent experiments have demonstrated that amphibians can learn to recognize predators prior to hatching. Here, we conditioned <b>woodfrog</b> embryos to recognize predatory salamander cues either {{in the morning or}} in the evening, and subsequently exposed the two-week-old tadpoles to salamander cues either in the morning or in the evening, and recorded the intensity of their antipredator behaviour. The data indicate that amphibians learn to recognize potential predators while still in the egg, and also learn the temporal component of this information, which they use later in life, to adjust the intensity of their antipredator responses throughout the day...|$|E
40|$|Many prey species lack innate {{recognition}} of their potential predators. Hence, learning is required for them to recognize and respond to predation threats. When wild-caught, these same species may show amazing sophistication in their responses to predator cues. They are able to adjust the intensity of their antipredator responses to a particular predator according {{to the degree of}} threat posed by that predator. This ability is therefore acquired through learning. While many studies have shown that prey can learn to respond to predator cues through different learning modes, little is known about what the prey are actually learning. The results presented in this thesis show that learned predator recognition goes beyond the simple labelling of predators as dangerous. Using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), <b>woodfrog</b> (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles and boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) tadpoles, I demonstrated that a one time learning event, either through pairing with alarm cues or through social learning, was enough for prey to learn the level of threat associated with the novel predator cues. I showed that the level of danger associated with the predator cues was determined by the concentration of alarm cues when learning through pairing of alarm cues, or by the intensity of antipredator response displayed by the tutors and by the tutor-to-observer ratio when learning occurred through cultural transmission. Moreover, when subsequently exposed to predator cues, prey adjusted their antipredator responses according to the change in concentration of predator cues between the learning event and the subsequent exposure. Prey displayed stronger antipredator responses when exposed to higher concentrations of predator cues and vice versa. When minnows were provided with conflicting information about the danger level associated with a predator, they displayed a safety strategy and used the most recent information available to respond to predation threats. On a longer time scale, the data also suggest that <b>woodfrog</b> tadpoles are able to learn to respond to predation threats according to the risk posed by the predator at different times of day. Finally, I showed that prey learn to recognize particular characteristics of predators and can generalize their antipredator responses to novel species sharing those characteristics. However, generalization of predator recognition is dependent on the level of risk associated with the predator. Threat-sensitive learning is an extremely complex process shaped by the millions of years of selection imposed by predators on prey...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} develop {{effective}} antipredator responses early in life should be strongly promoted by natural selection. Recent work has shown that embryonic amphibians can learn to recognize predators even before they hatch. Here, we showed that embryonic <b>woodfrogs,</b> Rana sylvatica, learned the danger level associated with a predator prior to hatching and generalized their learned recognition to other similar predators with which the <b>woodfrogs</b> lacked experience. Embryos exposed to salamander odor (SO) paired with injured tadpole cues learned to recognize the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum, but those exposed to SO paired with well water did not. When we increased the concentration of alarm cues to which embryos were exposed, tadpoles showed stronger response to salamander cues. In addition, the tadpoles generalize their learned response to the odor of closely related newts Cynops pyrrhogaster but not Xenopus frogs. In accordance with the Predator Recognition Continuum Hypothesis, the ability to generalize was dependent on the threat level of the predator. Our results highlight the sophistication of learned responses to predators by embryonic amphibians and stress the need for studies in other taxa. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Mole {{salamanders}} (Ambystoma) and <b>woodfrogs</b> (Lithobates sylvaticus) {{are abundant}} in New England and depend on ephemeral wetlands for breeding. Their aquatic habitats {{have been well}} studied and are protected by several local and regional regulations. State endangered species laws also protect mabled salamanders (A. opacum), Jefferson salamanders (A. jeffersonianum), and blue-spotted salamanders (A. laterale). However, these amphbibians {{spend most of their}} adult lives in terrestrial habitats that remain poorly protected and elusive to researchers. In chapter 1, I developed a novel technique using passive integrated transponders for tracking small animals. I used this technique to track marbled salamanders walking up to 200 m from their breeding pond during post-breeding migrations. In Chapter 2, I examined the importance of multiple habitat variables for predicting the distributions of <b>woodfrogs</b> and spotted salamanders at 455 ponds in western Massachusetts. Based on a variable-comparison technique I developed, the best predictor for either species of amphibian was the amount of forest in the surrounding vii landscape. Both species were found more frequently in upland forests where the ponds are least protected by state and federal wetland regulations. In chapter 3, I used my data from chapter 2 and three other similar data sets to conduct an analysis of spatial scale and to parameterize a recently published resistant kernel model. The complex model parameterized by an expert panel did significantly worse than the null model. The distributions of both amphibians were best predicted by measuring the landscape at very large scales (over 1000 m). The most effective scales for conservation may be largest for organisms of intermediate dispersal capability. In chapter 4, I explored the evolution and genetics of the Jefferson/blue-spotted/unisexual salamander complex. I framed research into the fascinating unisexual reproductive system with a model that relates nuclear genome replacement, positive selection on hybrids, and biogeography of the species complex. I parameterized this model using genetic data taken from salamanders spanning Massachusetts and an individual-based breeding simulation. If paternal genomes are transmitted to offspring with the frequencies reported from laboratory experiments, then my model suggests that there must be strong selection favoring unisexuals with hybrid nuclei...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{fundamental}} {{prerequisite for}} prey {{to avoid being}} captured {{is the ability to}} distinguish dangerous stimuli such as predators and risky habitats from nondangerous stimuli such as non-predators and safe locations. Most research to date has focused on mechanisms allowing prey to learn to recognize risky stimuli. The paradox of learned predator recognition is that its remarkable efficiency leaves room for potentially costly mistakes if prey inadvertently learn to recognize non-predatory species as dangerous. Here, we pre-exposed embryonic <b>woodfrogs,</b> Rana sylvatica, to the odour of a tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum, without risk reinforcement, and later try to teach the tadpoles to recognize the salamander, a redbellied newt Cynops pyrrhogaster—a closely related amphibian, or a goldfish, Carassius auratus, as a predator. Tadpoles were then tested for their responses to salamander, newt or fish odour. Pre-exposure to salamander did not affect the ability of tadpoles to learn to recognize goldfish as a predator. However, the embryonic pre-exposure to salamanders inhibited the subsequent learning of salamanders as a potential predator, through a mechanism known as latent inhibition. The embryonic pre-exposure also prevented the learned recognition of novel newts, indicating complete generalization of non-predator recognition. This pattern does not match that of generalizatio...|$|R
40|$|Hundreds {{of studies}} have {{investigated}} the sources and nature of information that prey gather about their predators {{and the ways in}} which prey use this information to mediate their risk of predation. However, relatively little theoretical or empirical work has considered the question of how long information should be maintained and used by prey animals in making behavioural decisions. Here, we tested whether the size of the memory window associated with predator recognition could be affected by an intrinsic factor, such as size and growth rate of the prey. We maintained groups of predator-naive <b>woodfrog,</b> Lithobates sylvaticus, tadpoles at different temperatures for 8 days to induce differences in tadpole size. We then conditioned small and large tadpoles to recognize the odour of a predatory tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum. Tadpoles were then maintained either on a high or low growth trajectory for another 8 days, after which they were tested for their response to the predator. Our results suggest that the memory window related to predator recognition of tadpoles is determined by both their size and/or growth rate at the time of learning and their subsequent growth rate post-learning...|$|E

This pattern does not match that of generalization of predator recognition, whereby species learning to recognize a novel predator do respond, but not as strongly, to novel species closely related to the known predator. The current paper discusses the costs of making recognition mistakes within the context of generalization of predators and dangerous habitats versus generalization of non-predators and safe habitats and highlights the asymmetry in which amphibians incorporate information related to safe versus risky cues in their decision-making. Mechanisms such as latent inhibition allow a variety of prey species to collect information about non-threatening stimuli, as early as during their embryonic development, and to use this information later in life to infer the danger level associated with the stimuli...|$|R
