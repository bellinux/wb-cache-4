500|$|Mark Androvich of Classic Gamer Magazine was {{similarly}} negative, writing [...] "Games by Apollo released {{a couple of}} decent games before going bankrupt, but you never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that anyone at the company knew how to program the Atari 2600 judging by their debut game." [...] Androvich opined that while the game was playable, it was not [...] "a {{step in the right}} direction" [...] for Apollo.|$|E
2500|$|Theisen-Eaton {{competed for}} Canada in the {{heptathlon}} at the 2016 Summer Olympics. After {{the first day}} she trailed in sixth place, despite going into the Olympics with the world leading score. During the second day she performed well in the long-jump and javelin events, getting near personal bests which put her into the third-place position going into the final event, the 800 metres. She would finish third in her heat and win the bronze medal scoring 6653 behind winner and upstart Nafissatou Thiam, with Jessica Ennis-Hill finishing second. She said of day two that [...] "I'm happy with today, really happy with today. I never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> after that kind of first day I would {{end up with a}} medal and actually [...] score wasn't half bad either." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{a natural}} draftsman, and through long {{experimentation}} developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses {{a great variety of}} color palettes from nearly monochromatic to highly polychromatic. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and grid format compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or musical notation. The later works are distinguished by spidery hieroglyph-like symbols. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote about Klee in 1921, [...] "Even if you hadn’t told me he plays the violin, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I did," [...] said Bull brightly; [...] "but {{we talked}} in a pitch-dark {{room like a}} coalcellar. There, you <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{woman who}} could have sympathized with her <b>would</b> perhaps <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> what those words meant. Grace was simply embarrassed by her; and Grace failed to guess.|$|R
60|$|Cynthia's impassiveness, her {{complete}} poise, had fascinated Miss Duncan {{with the}} others. Had there been nothing beneath that exterior, Janet <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> it, and she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been quite as happy. Cynthia saw {{very clearly that}} Mr. Worthington or no other man or woman could force Bob to marry Janet.|$|R

50|$|The series {{consisted}} of panelists <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> a location {{by listening to}} clues and viewing photos. Hosts included Dan Seymour, Ken Roberts, and John Reed King, and panelists included Bill Cullen, Nancy Guild, Virginia Graham, and Skitch Henderson.|$|R
60|$|What reason either {{could she}} <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> that Whitby cliff {{had once been}} coral-mud, {{at the bottom of}} the sea? No more reason, my dear child, than you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> that this stone had been coral-mud likewise, if I did not teach you so,--or rather, try to make you teach {{yourself}} so.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dixon <b>would</b> fain <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> {{whether the}} present {{thoughts}} were favourable, but all his hope in his extremity {{was in his}} nephew; it might be fatal to push him too far, and, with a certain trust in his good-nature, Sebastian allowed him to walk away without further remonstrance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma, won't {{you speak}} for us?" [...] implored Sydney. [...] "I did behave so well when he went! Nobody <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> we hadn't been married fifty years." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{game from}} {{towards the end}} of Series Eight. Noel would link up with three {{regional}} news programmes, who would each bring an improbable-sounding news story from their region. The contestants <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> whether the stories were true or false.|$|R
5000|$|Bargeld {{left school}} prior to {{completion}} and is self-taught. He revealed in 2010: [...] "I <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> when I was 13 that I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become a professional musician. It {{was so far}} away as to become a reality in my personal life." [...] Bargeld experimented with audio equipment as a teenager, including the disassembling of tape recorders.|$|R

50|$|In this {{challenge}} the contestants plays a guessing game where Craig ask {{a series of}} questions where they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> the closes to the actual amount. The contestant who was the most off from the actual answer would be eliminated from the round.|$|R
2500|$|Consider {{for example}} the secret sharing scheme in which the secret phrase [...] "{{password}}" [...] is divided into the shares [...] "pa––––––", [...] "––ss––––", [...] "––––wo––", and [...] "––––––rd". A person with 0 shares knows only that the password consists of eight letters. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> the password from 268 = 208 billion possible combinations. A person with one share, however, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> only the six letters, from 266 = 308 million combinations, and so on as more persons collude. Consequently this system is not a [...] "secure" [...] secret sharing scheme, because a player with fewer than t secret shares is able to reduce the problem of obtaining the inner secret without first needing to obtain all of the necessary shares.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presented}} a loop transformation algorithm to enhance data locality for uniprocessors and multiprocessors. I <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> in 1991 when {{this paper was}} published {{that it would take}} ten years before we arrived at a solution that I felt satisfactorily solved the complete problem. I would like to take this opportunity to describe our discoveries along this journe...|$|R
60|$|The horse's hoofs were drawing near by now, so Jantje slipped {{as easily}} and {{naturally}} as a snake into a thick tuft of rank grass which grew between the blue gums, and waited. Nobody <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that this tuft of grass hid a human being; {{not even a}} Boer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> it, unless he had happened to walk right on to the spy, {{and then it would}} have been a chance but that the Hottentot managed to avoid being trodden on and escaped detection. Again there was no reason why he should hide himself in this fashion, except that it pleased him to do so.|$|E
60|$|MALONE. I should esteem {{it a great}} favor if I {{might have}} a short {{conversation}} with you, madam. I am Hector's father, as this bright Britisher <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> {{in the course of}} another hour or so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I now?" [...] she {{retorted}} gaily. [...] "Faith, {{my little}} Chauvelin, I {{should have thought}} that, with your penetration, you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that an atmosphere composed of fogs and virtues would never suit Marguerite St. Just." ...|$|E
60|$|The She-Ancient {{takes her}} two saws, {{and with a}} couple of strokes rips the egg open. The Newly Born, a pretty girl who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>guessed</b> as {{seventeen}} in our day, sits up in the broken shell, exquisitely fresh and rosy, but with filaments of spare albumen clinging to her here and there.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I am {{sure it is}} {{not from}} the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells, or they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>guessed</b> at first.

I may not have {{convinced}} you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business." ...|$|R
60|$|In a big {{forest in}} the north of America lived a {{quantity}} of wild animals of all sorts. They were always very polite when they met; but, in spite of that, they kept a close watch one upon the other, as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else. But their manners were so good that no one <b>would</b> ever <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> that.|$|R
6000|$|A greater {{experience}} than Philip's <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> from these words the probabilities of the encounter: the distinguished writer invited to luncheon en famille, the governess coming in sedately {{with the two}} tall girls she was teaching; the introduction: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} told me who she is because I never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> it," [...] confessed Peter as he studied the newcomer. She {{did not look at}} all like Weaver. She was dressed in olive-green and dull yellow, with white {{markings}} on her wings.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, his nimble {{fingers were}} flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes {{wore the same}} far-away {{expression}} which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one <b>would</b> hardly <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at {{the soles of his}} patent leather boots.|$|R
60|$|You <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that {{in infancy}} he had suckled at the breast of a hideous, hairy she-ape, nor {{that in all}} his {{conscious}} past since his parents had passed away in the little cabin by the landlocked harbor at the jungle's verge, he had known no other associates than the sullen bulls and the snarling cows of the tribe of Kerchak, the great ape.|$|R
60|$|The fame of this {{wonderful}} deed soon {{spread through the}} country, and people would often stop Geirald's horse, and ask leave to see the robber's ring, which {{was said to have}} been stolen from the father of the reigning king.
