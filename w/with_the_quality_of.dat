5|$|Addie Joss {{was born}} in Woodland, Dodge County, Wisconsin. His parents Jacob and Theresa (née Staudenmeyer) worked as farmers; his father, a cheesemaker who was {{involved}} in local politics, had emigrated from Switzerland. A heavy drinker of alcohol, he died from liver complications in 1890, when Joss was 10 years old; Joss remained sober throughout his life {{as a result of his}} father's death. Joss attended elementary school in Juneau and Portage and high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. By age 16 he finished high school and began teaching himself. He was offered a scholarship to attend St. Mary's College (also known as Sacred Heart College) in Watertown, where he played on the school's baseball team. He also attended the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin-Madison), where he studied engineering. Officials in Watertown were impressed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> play of St. Mary's and put the team on a semipro circuit. During his time on the semipro circuit, Joss employed his unique pitching windup, which involved hiding the ball until the very last moment in his delivery.|$|E

Kumar approached Bhatt for a possible sequel, although it was Shagufta Rafique's melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that the film had potential as a sequel and decided {{to proceed with the}} project. Given Aashiqui 's status in Hindi cinematic history as one of the finest Indian musicals of all time, many expressed concerns towards the decision to remake the film, dubious that the producers could come up with a soundtrack on par <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the 1990 film. Bhatt stated that they completely resisted the temptation to use the soundtrack of the earlier film, and promised that Aashiqui 2 would revive the era of melodious film music, as Aashiqui had done 22 years ago.|$|E

North Korean cinema could not compete <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> foreign, and in particular South Korean, films. This directly prompted him to kidnap Shin Sang-ok, South Korea's most famous film director, in 1978. Shin and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, were kept in North Korea for eight years under cruel conditions. Nevertheless, Shin studied On the Art of the Cinema to please Kim with the kaijū film Pulgasari, which credits Kim as the executive producer. Kim was delighted with the film and allowed Shin and Choi to travel to Vienna, where {{they were supposed to}} negotiate a deal for a sequel. The couple used the opportunity to escape, and ended up in America.|$|E
5|$|The first {{appearance}} {{of this species}} in the literature was in 1890, under the name Colus fusiformis, when Eduard Fischer wrote a description based on a painting he found in the Paris Museum of Natural History. In his 1944 monograph on the Gasteromycetes of Australia and New Zealand, Gordon Herriot Cunningham considered this naming to be a nomen nudum—not published with an adequate description. However, it was valid under {{the rules of the}} International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. In 1899 Penzig described the species Colus javanicus based on a single specimen found on Java, and a year later Fischer amended the name of his original Colus fusiformis to Colus javanicus, as he was not satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> his original description. Despite his doubts on the validity of his description, his original naming is both legitimate and has priority over C.javanicus.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield United Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} based at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, who currently compete in Football League One. Founded in 1889, they played only friendlies {{during their first}} year in existence before being elected to the Midland Counties League for the 1890–91 season. The football committee (who ran the club at the time) were unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the Midland Counties League and so resigned {{in the summer of}} 1891. However, United were refused entry into The Football League amidst an acrimonious dispute with local rivals The Wednesday who had lobbied against their application. Instead United joined the newly formed Northern League which mainly consisted of teams from the North East of England, resulting in their nearest away fixture being at Darlington, some 85 miles away. Sheffield United again applied for election to The Football League the following year, this time being successful, and were admitted to the new Second Division in 1892. Despite the club's desire {{to be part of the}} Football League some committee members felt it may not last and so United remained with the Northern League for one more season, thus competing in two leagues concurrently during the 1892–93 season. Since that time United have remained in either the Football League, or at times the Premier League (during the 1992–93, 1993–94 and 2006–07 seasons), although changing fortunes have meant that they have competed in all four of the top divisions in England at some stage.|$|E
