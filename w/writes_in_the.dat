5|$|Phil England <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Ecologist {{that the}} {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E

25|$|Two centuries later, the {{well-known}} Ottoman itinerant Evliya Çelebi gave {{a list of}} groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray and Çarşamba, bear {{the names of the}} places of origin of their inhabitants. However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmed allowed the deported Greeks {{to come back to the}} city. This measure apparently had no great success, since French voyager Pierre Gilles <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to name any of the ancient Byzantine churches that had been transformed into mosques or abandoned. This shows that the population substitution had been total.|$|E

Rabbi Wahrman <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and not the slightest hint of hatred.

25|$|Julius Obsequens was a Roman {{writer who}} is {{believed}} to have lived {{in the middle of the}} fourth century AD. The only work associated with his name is the Liber de prodigiis (Book of Prodigies), completely extracted from an epitome, or abridgment, written by Livy; De prodigiis was constructed as an account of the wonders and portents that occurred in Rome between 249 BC-12 BC. An aspect of Obsequens' work that has inspired much interest in some circles is that references are made to things moving through the sky. These have been interpreted as reports of UFOs, but may just as well describe meteors, and, since Obsequens, probably, <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th century, that is, some 400 years after the events he describes, they hardly qualify as eye-witness accounts.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Janov's primal therapy, {{which has}} been an {{influential}} post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, {{he does not have}} a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it. Janov <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Primal Scream (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} of his science fiction and in {{particular}} with Hyperion, Ilium demonstrates that Simmons <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soft science fiction tradition of Ray Bradbury and Ursula K. Le Guin. Ilium {{is based on a}} literary approach similar to most of Bradbury's work, but describes larger segments of society and broader historical events. As in Le Guin's Hainish series, Simmons places the action of Ilium in a vast and complex universe made of relatively plausible technological and scientific elements. Yet Ilium is different from any of the works of Bradbury and Le Guin in its exploration of the very far future of humanity, and in the extra human or post-human themes associated with this. It deals with the concept of technological singularity where technological change starts to occur beyond the ability of humanity to presently predict or comprehend. The first book, Ilium, received the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction novel in 2004.|$|E
