40|$|Background/purpose: Presently, skin-cleaning {{agents that}} claim to be removed by water or wiping alone are commercially {{available}} and {{have been used for}} the purpose of bed baths. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on how water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping</b> differently affect skin physiological functions or ceramide content. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping</b> on skin physiological functions and ceramide content. Methods: Three kinds of the cleaning agents with different removal techniques (ie, water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping)</b> were used in this study. Skin physiological functions (ie, transepidermal water loss, skin hydration, and skin pH) and skin ceramide content were measured before and after seven consecutive days of the application of each cleaning agent. Results: No significant differences in skin physiological functions or ceramide content were observed between water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping.</b> Conclusion: Cleaning agents {{that claim to}} be removed by water <b>washing</b> or <b>wiping</b> do not affect skin physiological functions or ceramide content by either removal method. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. in Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

It is recommended to conduct sampling efficiency studies prior to field sampling, under conditions that are quite similar to conditions of exposure regarding exposure process, levels of skin loading, and time of residence of the compound on the skin. Harmonization of sampling protocols will be a first step in creating a database for better understanding the influence of sampling parameters on the performance of removal techniques to assess dermal exposure.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{for personal}} sampling for inhalable aerosol hazards is constrained by issues of sampler cost and complexity; these issues have limited the adoption {{and use of}} some samplers by practicing hygienists. Thus, despite the known health effects of inhalable aerosol hazards, personal exposures are routinely assessed for {{only a small fraction}} of the at-risk workforce. To address the limitations of current technologies for inhalable aerosol sampling, a disposable inhalable aerosol sampler was developed and evaluated in the laboratory. The new sampler is designed to be less expensive and simpler to use than existing technologies. The sampler incorporates a lightweight internal capsule fused to the sampling filter. This capsule-filter assembly allows for the inclusion of particles deposited on the internal walls and inlet, thus minimizing the need to <b>wash</b> or <b>wipe</b> the interior sampling cassette when conducting gravimetric analyses. Sampling efficiency and wall losses were tested in a low-velocity wind tunnel with particles ranging from 9. 5 to 89. 5. The results were compared to the proposed low-velocity inhalability criterion as well as published data on the IOM sampler. Filter weight stability and time-to-equilibrium were evaluated as these factors affect the practicality of a design. Preliminary testing of the new sampler showed good agreement with both the IOM and the proposed low-velocity inhalability curve. The capsule and filter assemblies reached equilibrium within 25 h of manufacturing when conditioned at elevated temperatures. After reaching equilibrium, the capsule-filter assemblies were stable within 0. 01 mg.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the on-farm management factors that are associated with the Bacillus cereus count in raw bulk tank milk using a cross sectional study design. Bulk tank milk quality was monitored for B. cereus on 63 dairy farms between July and August 2012. Bulk tank milk samples corresponding with processor milk collection dates were taken over a two week period prior to the farm visit and tested for B. cereus. The four most recent samples taken prior to the on-farm visit were averaged and log transformed to give the outcome variable; mean log 10 B. cereus cfu/mL. On-farm data collection included recording observations and providing a questionnaire on basic hygiene, management factors and cow hygiene scoring. All independent variables were analysed individually with the outcome variable using simple linear regression and one-way ANOVA; a multivariable regression model was subsequently developed. Only significant variables were retained in the final model (P < 0. 05). The geometric mean B. cereus count for all milk samples was 40 cfu/mL. The start temperature of the cleaning solution <b>wash,</b> dry <b>wiping</b> teats prior to unit application, the feeding of silage and reusing the cleaning solution more than once were all unconditionally associated (P < 0. 10) with the B. cereus count in bulk tank milk but did not enter the final multivariable model. B. cereus count was four times greater (201 cfu/mL) when cows had been housed compared to when they were on pasture (50 cfu/mL). The allocation of fresh grass every 12 h (62 cfu/mL) resulted in a decrease in B. cereus count (166 cfu/mL every 24 h or greater). The testing of water for bacteriology was associated with an increase in B. cereus count. In conclusion, this study highlights specific management factors associated with the B. cereus count in bulk tank milk. peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|R
