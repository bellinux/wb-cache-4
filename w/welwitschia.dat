25|$|Gnetophyta {{consists}} of three genera, Ephedra, Gnetum and <b>Welwitschia.</b> All three are typically dioecious, although some Ephedra species exhibit monoecy. In contrast to the conifers, which have simple pollen strobili and compound seed strobili, gnetophytes have both compound pollen and seed strobili. The seed strobili of Ephedra and Gnetum are reduced, with Ephedra producing only two ovules per strobilus and Gnetum a single ovule.|$|E

In 1910 he and his wife departed Lourenço Marques for Kenya and Uganda, collecting in the Aberdare Mountains and returning with a new species of tree Lobelia.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Welwitschia</b> is a {{monotypic}} gymnosperm genus, comprising solely {{the distinctive}} <b>Welwitschia</b> mirabilis. The plant is commonly {{known simply as}} <b>welwitschia</b> in English, but the name tree tumbo is also used. It is called kharos or khurub in Nama, tweeblaarkanniedood in Afrikaans, nyanka in Damara, and onyanga in Herero. <b>Welwitschia</b> is the only living genus of the family Welwitschiaceae and order Welwitschiales, in the division Gnetophyta. Informal sources commonly refer to the plant as a [...] "living fossil". <b>Welwitschia</b> mirabilis is endemic to the Namib desert within Namibia and Angola.|$|E

40|$|The fungi Aspergillus niger and A. <b>welwitschiae</b> are morphologically indistinguishable species {{used for}} {{industrial}} fermentation and {{for food and}} beverage production. The fungi also occur widely on food crops. Concerns about their safety have arisen with the discovery that some isolates of both species produce fumonisin (FB) and ochratoxin A (OTA) mycotoxins. Here, we examined FB and OTA production {{as well as the}} presence of genes responsible for synthesis of the mycotoxins in a collection of 92 A. niger/A. <b>welwitschiae</b> isolates from multiple crop and geographic origins. The results indicate that (i) isolates of both species differed in ability to produce the mycotoxins; (ii) FB-nonproducing isolates of A. niger had an intact fumonisin biosynthetic gene (rum) cluster; (iii) FB-nonproducing isolates of A. <b>welwitschiae</b> exhibited multiple patterns of fum gene deletion; and (iv) OTA-nonproducing isolates of both species lacked the ochratoxin A biosynthetic gene (ota) cluster. Analysis of genome sequence data revealed a single pattern of ota gene deletion in the two species. Phylogenetic analysis suggest that the simplest explanation for this is that ota cluster deletion occurred in a common ancestor of A. niger and A. <b>welwitschiae,</b> and subsequently both the intact and deleted cluster were retained as alternate alleles during divergence of the ancestor into descendent species. Finally, comparison of results from this and previous studies indicate that a majority of A. niger isolates and a minority of A. <b>welwitschiae</b> isolates can produce FBs, whereas, a minority of isolates of both species produce OTA. The comparison also suggested that the relative abundance of each species and frequency of FB/OTA-producing isolates can vary with crop and/or geographic origin...|$|R

5000|$|Two <b>Welwitschias</b> (one {{male and}} one female), the rare and {{endangered}} desert plant discovered in 1859 by the Austrian Friedrich Welwitsch.

5000|$|The {{species is}} dioecious, with {{separate}} {{male and female}} plants. Fertilization is carried out by insects including flies and true bugs. The commonest of the true bugs attending <b>Welwitschia</b> {{is a member of}} the family Pyrrhocoridae: Odontopus sexpunctatus. The genus is also known as Probergrothius and the matter of which name is correct is still under discussion. Though much associated with <b>Welwitschia</b> mirabilis however, Odontopus sexpunctatus may not be a <b>Welwitschia</b> specialist, as there are claims that it also occurs on other plants, such as Adansonia, though it is not clear how well-supported these claims might be. Infrequently, wasps and bees also play a role as pollinators of <b>Welwitschia.</b> At least some of the pollinators are attracted by [...] "nectar" [...] produced on both male and female strobili.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{fumonisin}} mycotoxins varies {{among members of the}} black aspergilli. Previously, analyses of selected genes in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (fum) cluster in black aspergilli from California grapes indicated that fumonisin-nonproducing isolates of Aspergillus <b>welwitschiae</b> lack six fum genes, but nonproducing isolates of Aspergillus niger do not. In the current study, analyses of black aspergilli from grapes from the Mediterranean Basin indicate that the genomic context of the fum cluster is the same in isolates of A. niger and A. <b>welwitschiae</b> regardless of fumonisin-production ability and that full-length clusters occur in producing isolates of both species and nonproducing isolates of A. niger. In contrast, the cluster has undergone an eight-gene deletion in fumonisin-nonproducing isolates of A. <b>welwitschiae.</b> Phylogenetic analyses suggest each species consists of a mixed population of fumonisinproducing and nonproducing individuals, and that existence of both production phenotypes may provide a selective advantage to these species. Differences in gene content of fum cluster homologues and phylogenetic relationships of fum genes suggest that the mutation(s) responsible for the nonproduction phenotype differs, and therefore arose independently, in the two species. Partial fum cluster homologues were also identified in genome sequences of four other black Aspergillus species. Gene content of these partial clusters and phylogenetic relationships of fum sequences indicate that non-random partial deletion of the cluster has occurred multiple times among the species. This in turn suggests that an intact cluster and fumonisin production were once more widespread among black aspergilli...|$|R

40|$|Onion bulbs {{can become}} {{contaminated}} with various molds during the storage period, {{the most important}} causal agents being black aspergilli (Aspergillus section Nigri). Taxonomic studies have revealed that this group of Aspergillus contains many species that cannot be reliably identified using standard morphological methods. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} define the fungus causing this problem in the onion exactly, especially since some species assigned to section Nigri are well known as ochratoxin and/or fumonisin producers. Sixty fungal isolates belonging to 10 fungal genera were isolated from 40 onion samples originated from the Taif region in Saudi Arabia. Black aspergilli were detected in 37 onion samples. Using primer pairs (awaspec and Cmd 6) designed based on partial calmodulin gene sequence data, 37 isolates were identified as A. <b>welwitschiae.</b> The ochratoxin A and fumonisin B 2 contents of the onion samples were examined. No ochratoxins were detected in the collected samples, while fumonisin B 2 was detected in 37. 5 % of the onion samples. Eighteen of 37 isolates of Aspergillus <b>welwitschiae</b> were recognized as potential producers for fumonisin B 2. Multiplex polymerase chain reactions designed to detect biosynthetic genes of fumonisins confirmed these results...|$|R
