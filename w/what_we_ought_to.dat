On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do. As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can you tell me where we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Tu, {{the more}} man can {{penetrate}} his own inner sources, {{the more he}} can transcend himself. By the metaphorical words of Mencius (7a29) is like [...] "digging a well to reach the source of water." [...] It is for this emphasis on transcending the phenomena to reach the true self, which is the divine, that Tu defines Confucian religiosity as the [...] "ultimate self-transformation as a communal act and as a faithful dialogical response to the transcendent" [...] ans says {{that this is the}} Confucian prescription to develop the right nature of humanity. Tu furtherly explains the concept as a prognosis and diagnosis of humanity: [...] "we are not <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be but <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be is inherent in the structure of what we are".|$|E
2500|$|One {{response}} to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: [...] "No doubt we do instinctively prefer {{to help those who}} are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do, {{and it is difficult to}} see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1964–65 Johnson was {{pressured}} by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam; moreover, a plurality in the polls {{at the time were}} in favor of military action against the communists, with only 26 to 30 percent opposed. Johnson revised his priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. He then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara, that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation. Johnson said, [...] "Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do. I'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly. General Nguyễn Khánh (head of the new government) is our boy".|$|E

2500|$|Gladstone {{supported}} the London dockers in their strike of 1889. After their victory {{he gave a}} speech at Hawarden on 23 September in which he said: [...] "In the common interests of humanity, this remarkable strike {{and the results of}} this strike, which have tended somewhat to strengthen the condition of labour in the face of capital, is the record of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> regard as satisfactory, as a real social advance [...] tends to a fair principle of division of the fruits of industry". This speech has been described by Eugenio Biagini as having [...] "no parallel in the rest of Europe except in the rhetoric of the toughest socialist leaders". Visitors at Hawarden in October were [...] "shocked...by some rather wild language on the Dock labourers question". Gladstone was impressed with workers unconnected with the dockers' dispute who [...] "intended to make common cause" [...] in the interests of justice.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the 50th {{anniversary of}} Buechner's ordination, Rich Barlowe wrote of Buechner in the Boston Globe, [...] "Who knows? The words are Frederick Buechner's mantra. Over {{the course of}} an hourlong chat with the writer and Presbyterian {{minister}} in his kitchen, they recur any number of times in response to questions about his faith and theology. Dogmatic religious believers would dismiss the two words as the warning shot of doubt. But for Buechner, it is precisely our doubts and struggles that mark us as human. And that insight girds his theological twist on Socrates: The unexamined human life is a lost chance to behold the divine." [...] In 2002, Richard Kauffman interviewed Buechner for The Christian Century upon the publication of Speak What We Feel (Not <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Ought</b> <b>to</b> Say). Buechner answered the question [...] "Do you envision a particular audience when you write?" [...] by saying [...] "I always hope to reach people who don't want to touch religion with a ten-foot pole. The cultured despisers of religion, Sehleiermacher called them. Maybe some of my books reach them. But most of my readers, as far as I can tell, aren't that type. Many of them are ministers. They say, 'You've given us something back we lost and opened up doors we didn't think could be opened for people.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics of DeLillo {{argue that}} his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow. In James Wood's review of Zadie Smith's 2000 novel White Teeth, he {{dismissed}} {{the work of}} authors like Dellilo, Wallace, and Smith as [...] "hysterical realism". Bruce Bawer famously condemned DeLillo's novels insisting they weren't actually novels at all but [...] "tracts, designed to batter us, again and again, with a single idea: that life in America today is boring, benumbing, dehumanized...It's better, DeLillo seems to say in one novel after another, to be a marauding murderous maniac – and therefore a human – than to sit still for America as it is, with its air conditioners, assembly lines, television sets, supermarkets, synthetic fabrics, and credit cards." [...] George Will proclaimed the study of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra as [...] "sandbox existentialism" [...] and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship." [...] DeLillo responded [...] "I don't take it seriously, but being called a 'bad citizen' is a compliment to a novelist, at least to my mind. That's exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do. We ought to be bad citizens. We ought to, {{in the sense that}} we're writing against what power represents, and often what government represents, and what the corporation dictates, and what consumer consciousness has come to mean. In that sense, if we're bad citizens, we're doing our job." [...] In the same interview DeLillo rejected Will's claim that DeLillo blames America for Lee Harvey Oswald, countering that he instead blamed America for George Will. DeLillo also figured prominently in B. R. Myers's critique of recent American literary fiction, A Reader's Manifesto.|$|E
