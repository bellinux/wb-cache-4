The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for parametrizing linear cosmological {{perturbations}} of theories of gravity, around homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds. The method is sufficiently general and systematic {{that it can be}} applied to theories <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom (DoFs) and arbitrary gauge symmetries. In this paper, we focus on scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories, invariant under linear coordinate transformations. In the case of scalar-tensor theories, we use our framework to recover the simple parametrizations of linearized Horndeski and ''Beyond Horndeski'' theories, and also find higher-derivative corrections. In the case of vector-tensor theories, we first construct the most general quadratic action for perturbations that leads to second-order equations of motion, which propagates two scalar DoFs. Then we specialize to the case in which the vector field is time-like (à la Einstein-Aether gravity), where the theory only propagates one scalar DoF. As a result, we identify the complete forms of the quadratic actions for perturbations, and the number of free parameters that need to be defined, to cosmologically characterize these two broad classes of theories...|$|R

Stewart Harral points up this condition from his book, Public Relations for Churches, churches have never lacked for public relations. "We've a Story to Tell to the Nations" has been more than a song as church leaders have used countless means of extending the influence of Christianity. But often their procedures have been isolated, erratic, or mere "shots in the dark. " With a mania for bigness some churches have used highly sensational methods to fill their sanctuaries and boost their budgets. Often when the momentary excitement has subsided they discover that their public relations structure has been built on sand.

Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic capital formation, depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of anti-money laundering systems, it is almost impossible to tell which anti-money laundering systems work and which are more or less cost effective.|$|E
