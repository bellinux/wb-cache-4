25|$|A May 2011 Hamilton College {{analysis}} of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman {{was the most}} accurate. Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, Maureen Dowd.|$|E
25|$|Alpha–beta pruning is {{a search}} {{algorithm}} {{that seeks to}} decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops completely evaluating a move when at least one possibility {{has been found that}} proves the move to be <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.|$|E

25|$|Males are {{territorial}} {{of their}} roosts, and will often fight other intruding males {{by means of}} boxing. Males follow a pattern of behavioral stages before fighting. This entails ear movements, head lifts, neck craning, wing unfolding, punch mimicking, and finally boxing with each other. Even though this is aggressive behavior, either male is allowed to stop fighting and leave the conflict, and injuries usually aren't <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few scrapes and bruises. It is also shown that males use distinct vocalizations during conflicts, which {{might be used to}} determine the identity of the competitor, and based on that information, parts of the pre-fighting stages can be skipped, and the animals will begin boxing.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{a playoff}} was {{introduced}} in season 2005–2006. It is used to determine which teams from the Eredivisie qualify for European football. The playoff system has been criticized by clubs, players and fans {{as the number of}} matches will increase. Under the original playoff format, it was possible, though thoroughly unlikely, that the runner-up would not qualify for Europe; the following year, the format was changed so that the second-place team was assured of no <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> UEFA Cup berth. Starting in 2008–09, the format was changed yet again. The champion goes directly to the Champions League; the runner-up enters the second qualification round of the CL; the number three enters the fourth (and last) qualification round of the UEFA Europa League (EL; the new name of the UEFA Cup from 2009–10 onward) and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL. The only play-off will be for the clubs placed 5th through 8th. The winner of that play-off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL.|$|E
25|$|Plots of {{the four}} results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method A clearly shows the best {{predictive}} power among A, B, and C. The result of B lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), {{and it can be}} seen in the table that the accuracy of B is 50%. However, when C is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method C′ is even better than A. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the C contingency table. Although the original C method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method C′ which has positive predictive power. When the C method predicts p or n, the C′ method would predict n or p, respectively. In this manner, the C′ test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the better it predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.|$|E

In the aftermath of the war, Coward wrote an alternative reality play, Peace In Our Time, depicting an England occupied by Nazi Germany.|$|E
500|$|Chris H. of AbsolutePunk {{said the}} band has made [...] "a big impression" [...] with its debut album {{and called it}} [...] "the {{heaviest}}" [...] release in their catalogue.

500|$|The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) had {{canceled}} the Dixie Classic, an annual basketball tournament in Raleigh, North Carolina, {{due to a}} national point-shaving scandal including a North Carolina player (Lou Brown). As {{a result of the}} scandal, North Carolina de-emphasized basketball by cutting their regular-season schedule. In Smith's first season, North Carolina played only 17 games and went 8-9. This was the only losing season he endured during his career. In 1965, he was famously hanged in effigy on the university campus following a disappointing loss to Wake Forest. After that game, UNC would win nine of their last eleven games, and Smith would subsequently go on to turn the program into a consistent success. [...] From 1965-66 onward, Smith's teams never finished worse than tied for third in the ACC. [...] For the first 21 of those years, they did not finish <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> tie for second. By comparison, during that time the ACC's other charter members each finished last at least once.|$|E
500|$|Closely {{associated}} with the now unpopular disco and having had no hit singles in the preceding few years, after leaving Fantasy Sylvester was not a particular draw for major record labels. Recognizing this state of affairs, in 1982 Sylvester commented that [...] "there's nothing <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> fallen star" [...] who still has [...] "illusions" [...] of their continuing fame. Rather than chasing major chart success, Sylvester wanted to focus on retaining creative control over his music. Hiring his former tour manager and longstanding friend Tim McKenna as his new manager, Sylvester decided to produce his next album with Megatone Records, a small San Francisco company that had been founded in 1981 by Patrick Cowley and Marty Blecman and which catered largely to the gay club scene. The result was All I Need (1982), on which James Wirrick had written most of the songs, which were dance-orientated and influenced by the new wave music then in vogue. Sylvester insisted that he include several ballads on the album, which featured cover art by Mark Amerika depicting Sylvester in ancient Egyptian garb.|$|E

[...] "He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside," [...] Fincher stated. Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role.

I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things.

500|$|Another {{space-saving}} innovation was {{the dielectric}} resonator, {{which can be}} used in other filter formats as well as waveguide. [...] The first use of these in a filter was by S. B.

[...] Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mechanical resonator made of invar, which led to instability of filter parameters.
