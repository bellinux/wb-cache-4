5|$|Exit {{numbers are}} absent along the Creek Turnpike until the 51st Street South interchange, which is {{numbered}} as exit 28. Exit numbers are posted north of this interchange, continuing until the highway's terminus (exits 33A–B). The Creek Turnpike's exit numbering {{is used for}} the final two exits on the westbound <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Turnpike—the westbound-only Pine Street exit (exit 35) and the westbound I-44 ramp (exit 34).|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma's largest {{commercial}} airport is <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> World Airport in Oklahoma City, averaging a yearly passenger count {{of more than}} 3.5 million (1.7 million boardings) in 2010. Tulsa International Airport, the state's second-largest {{commercial airport}}, served more than 1.3 million boardings in 2010. Between the two, six airlines operate in Oklahoma. In terms of traffic, R. L. Jones Jr. (Riverside) Airport in Tulsa is the state's busiest airport, with 335,826 takeoffs and landings in 2008. Oklahoma has over 150 public-use airports.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the portion}} of the highway between the eastern {{terminus}} and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.|$|E
5|$|In {{southeast}} Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E
5|$|Many {{film and}} {{television}} horses of the Golden Age of Hollywood were also Saddlebreds, including the horses used in lead roles in My Friend Flicka, National Velvet, Fury and one version of Black Beauty. A half-Saddlebred played the lead role in the TV series Mr. Ed, and a Saddlebred was used in {{a prominent role in}} Giant. In the 1990s, William Shatner, an actor and Saddlebred breeder, rode one of his own horses, a mare named Great Belles of Fire, in his role as James T. Kirk in Star Trek Generations. Numerous other celebrities have been owners and exhibitors of the breed, including William Shatner, Clark Gable, <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers,</b> Joe Louis, and Carson Kressley.|$|E

5|$|On March 22, 1989, three <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Turnpike tollbooth attendants made a {{surprise}} appearance at a Tulsans Against Turnpikes {{press conference to}} offer support to the opposition movement, expressing dissatisfaction with working conditions while manning the turnpike. The three attendants also gave examples of firsthand experience with turnpike customers that had convinced them that motorists were not as supportive of turnpikes as OTA executives believed. OTA responded to their employees' remarks by highlighting an Occupational Safety and Health Administration study that found that the toll gate that the three attendants worked at met all safety standards.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{running and}} cycling {{communities}} support {{events such as}} the Tulsa Tough cycling race, the Route 66 Marathon, and the Tulsa Run, which features over 8000 participants annually. Gambling is supported by a community of Indian gaming venues that have been allowed to expand gambling options. In 2005, compacts between the state and various tribes allowed facilities to offer table card games and slot machines. Another popular gambling draw, Horse racing events are housed by the Fair Meadows Race Track and <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Downs in nearby Claremore.|$|E
5|$|The western {{extension}} was {{the first}} to open to traffic. Following a brief dedication ceremony attended by Governor Keating, Transportation Secretary McCaleb, and OTA board member Bartlett, the highway opened on December 15, 2000. As with the first section of the turnpike, tolls were waived for the weekend; the road was free until noon on December 18. The south loop was opened in two segments. The first, from US-64/US-169 to South Elm Place in Broken Arrow, opened at 3p.m. August 15, 2001. The new segment remained toll-free until 7a.m. August 20. A rainy September pushed back the opening of {{the other half of the}} south loop by two months. The second half of the south loop, from Elm Place to New Orleans Street, opened at 2p.m. April 15, 2002. The final segment of the extension, connecting New Orleans Street and the Muskogee Turnpike to the <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Turnpike, was scheduled to open on August 16 of that year.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E
5|$|Carl G. Fisher, who was {{responsible}} for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{precautions}} {{were also}} enacted elsewhere in {{and near the}} storm's path; council members and citizens at Moore City Hall − where a council meeting {{was scheduled to be}} held that evening − sheltered in place in the building's first-floor restrooms, away from the multiple large-pane windows at its facade. In downtown Oklahoma City, spectators attending sporting events held that evening involving two of the city's minor league teams – a regular season baseball game between the Oklahoma RedHawks and Memphis Redbirds (which was suspended during the second inning) and Game 2 of the Ray Miron President's Cup series between the Oklahoma City Blazers and the Huntsville Channel Cats – were also evacuated to shelter in an underground storage area connected to the Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark and Myriad Convention Center amid concerns that the storm would jog northward and place Oklahoma City itself in the tornado's path. Flights were grounded at <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> World Airport as the northern edge of the supercell approached the area; the tornado turned right, away from southwestern parts of the city proper, shortly before airport officials began evacuating employees and visitors at the terminals. Traffic on Interstate 35 in south Oklahoma City and north Moore became backed up for several miles, as drivers evacuated from their vehicles to seek shelter under an overpass overlooking South Shields Boulevard.|$|E

5|$|The Voyage Home was {{the first}} Star Trek film to {{extensively}} film on location—only one day was spent doing so in The Search for Spock. Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting. The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city. The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems; {{a scene in which}} Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12–15cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect, taking a half-hour to reshoot. Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations, such as an Italian restaurant where Taylor and Kirk eat. In the film, the Bird-of-Prey lands cloaked in Golden Gate Park, surprising trashmen who flee the scene in their truck. The production had planned to film in the real park, where they had filmed scenes for The Wrath of Khan, but heavy rains before the day of shooting prevented it—the garbage truck would have become bogged down in the mud. <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Park in western Los Angeles was used instead.|$|E
5|$|The tornado then crossed Sooner Road, damaged {{an entry}} gate and several {{buildings}} at Tinker Air Force Base, then crossed 29th Street into Midwest City, destroying one {{building at the}} Boeing Complex and damaging two others. Widespread F3/F4 damage continued as the tornado moved across Interstate 40, affecting a large business district. Approximately 800 vehicles at Hudiburg Auto Group were damaged, located just south of Interstate 40. Hundreds of vehicles at the dealership were moved from their original location on the lot, and dozens of vehicles (including 30 awaiting tune-ups or repairs at Morris' Auto Machine and Supply, and an unoccupied Mid-Del School District bus) were picked up and tossed northward across the interstate into several motels, a distance of approximately two-tenths of a mile. Numerous motels and other businesses including Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, Inn Suites, Clarion Inn, Cracker Barrel, and portions of Rose State College, were destroyed. While some of the damage through this area was rated high-end F4, low-end F5 was considered. The tornado then continued into another residential area located between Southeast 15th and Reno Avenue, where three fatalities occurred. Damage consistent with high-end F4 wind speeds was inflicted to four homes in this area. Two of these homes were located between Southeast 11th and 12th Streets, near Buena Vista, {{and the other two}} homes were located on <b>Will</b> <b>Rogers</b> Road, just south of Southeast 15th. Damage then diminished rapidly to F0/F1 strength as the tornado crossed Reno Avenue, before dissipating three blocks north of Reno, between Sooner Road and Air Depot Boulevard. Throughout Oklahoma County, 12 people were killed and 234 others were injured while losses amounted to $450 million.|$|E
