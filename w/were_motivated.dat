5|$|Both the NDH {{forces and}} Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by the mass terror {{committed}} by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and south-eastern Bosnia. Drljević {{was opposed to}} Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro, which ran counter to Drljević's separatism.|$|E
5|$|During the {{economic}} {{expansion of the}} 1830s, Irish and German immigration to St. Louis increased substantially. In particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration. Many Irish <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by the Irish potato famine of 1845–1846 and the failed Irish uprising of 1848. Other Irish settlers came because of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of refugees <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by economic concerns and sought to improve their living conditions and opportunities by migrating to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising, the imposition of collectivisation and East Germany's final economic crisis in the late 1980s prompted surges {{in the number of}} escape attempts.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his service}} in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he {{returned}} to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to Cyprus. At the time, the Cyprus Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by the money they would receive to fight them.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E

5|$|According to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's actions <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> {{by several}} factors, which {{led him to}} regard Peter {{as a threat to}} himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, even if it had failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's {{recognition}} of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother William VI of Montferrat over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica—whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus—strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin Principality of Achaea. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} mission of Cardinal Pelagius, the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.|$|E
5|$|Al-Baqi cemetery, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} two most {{important}} Islamic graveyards located in Medina, Saudi Arabia, was demolished in 1806 and, following reconstruction in the mid-19th century, was destroyed again in 1925 or 1926. An alliance of the House of Saud, and the followers of the Wahhabi movement known as the Emirate of Diriyah, carried out the first demolition. The Sultanate of Nejd, also ruled by the House of Saud and followers of Wahhabism, carried out the second. In both cases, the actors <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, which prohibits the building of monuments on graves.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during {{the final years of}} his government, and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} First Aliyah in 1881, Jews began immigrating {{to the area}} from Eastern Europe in larger numbers, {{particularly}} from Poland and Russia. These Zionist pioneers <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they had grown up with, and adapt by using local produce, especially vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant, artichoke and chickpeas. The first Hebrew cookbook, written by Erna Meyer, and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking. The bread, olives, cheese and raw vegetables they adopted {{became the basis for}} the kibbutz breakfast, which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels, and in various forms in most Israeli homes today.|$|E
5|$|Brown faced a major prime-ministerial {{challenge}} {{two days}} after entering office, when two unexploded car bombs were discovered in London on 29 June. The following day, a car was driven into {{the entrance of the}} main terminal of Glasgow International Airport in a second apparent terrorist attack, causing a fire and considerable damage to the building. Brown was born in Glasgow, leading to speculation that the attacks <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> against him. As a result of both the London and Glasgow incidents, Brown chaired emergency COBRA meetings to review plans to protect the British public. He also spoke to the First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond regarding the incidents.|$|E
5|$|Playing with Fire {{became the}} top seller on Amazon.ca {{within a week}} of its release, and Fleury stated that he had been {{contacted}} by several sexual abuse victims who <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by his book to seek help. He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James, and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims. Fleury was surprised that his story became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, {{he and his wife were}} unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving. It is the second book about Fleury's life, following Fury, released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.|$|E

5|$|The Ustaše {{gathered}} {{them in a}} field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik {{prisoners and}} arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They {{and the others were}} loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, where they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević's separatism. Left without a leader, the majority of Đurišić's men were integrated into Drljević's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border.|$|E
5|$|The feminist, human rights, peace, civil rights, and anti-psychiatry {{movements}} {{were some of}} Millett's principal causes. Her books <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by her activism, such as woman's rights and mental health reform, and several were autobiographical memoirs that explored her sexuality, mental health, and relationships. In the 1960s and 1970s, Millett taught at Waseda University, Bryn Mawr College, Barnard College, and the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her later written works are The Politics of Cruelty (1994), about state-sanctioned torture in many countries, and Mother Millett (2001), a book about {{her relationship with her}} mother. Between 2011 and 2013, she won the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature, received Yoko Ono's Courage Award for the Arts, and was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese and French {{historians have}} {{fiercely}} debated Định's choice {{to disregard the}} treaty. The effectiveness of Định's insurgency led French officials to claim that Tự Đức was secretly assisting him, thereby violating the treaty, a pretext the French used to seize three more provinces in 1867. Vietnamese records dispute this, contending that Tự Đức attempted to ensure Định's compliance with the treaty. Định's defiance of the emperor has led historians to debate whether his actions <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by {{a rejection of the}} monarch's authority or whether he disobeyed in an attempt to help Tự Đức. Định remains widely respected among Vietnamese of all political persuasions. During the Vietnam War, communist historians sought to portray the Việt Cộng as Định's modern successor.|$|E

5|$|Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the House of Commons unsuccessfully petitioned her to {{consider}} marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would {{be relegated to}} a dependency of the Habsburgs. The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it {{on the basis of}} patriotism, while Protestants <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by a fear of Catholicism. When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. Thomas Wyatt the younger led a force from Kent to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as Wyatt's rebellion, which also involved the Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane. Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it. On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband Guildford Dudley were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Norwegian black metal scene <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to take violent action against this {{influence}} – for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and Jørn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands or individuals did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to permeate parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked {{to the past and}} took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic– it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the princely states were not uniformly {{enthusiastic}} about integrating their domains into independent India. Some, such as the rulers of Bikaner and Jawhar, <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to join India out of ideological and patriotic considerations, but others insisted {{that they had the}} right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, or form a union of their own. Bhopal, Travancore and Hyderabad announced that they did not intend to join either dominion. Hyderabad went as far as to appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the Portuguese to lease or buy Goa to give it access to the sea, and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its thorium reserves while asking for recognition. Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan. Bhopal attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the Muslim League to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress.|$|E
