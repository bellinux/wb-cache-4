Our approach incorporates the multivariate <b>Wald-Wolfowitz</b> <b>test</b> (WW-test), a non-parametric statistical test that measures {{the similarity between}} two different sets of multivariate data, which is utilized here for comparing texture distributions. By summarizing the texture information using standard feature extraction methodologies, the similarity measure provides a comprehensive estimate of the match between different images based on graph theory. The proposed “distributional metric ” is shown to handle efficiently the texture space dimensionality and the limited sample size drawn from a given image. The experimental results, from the application on a typical texture database, clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other texture distribution (dis) similarity metrics. In addition, its performance is used to evaluate several approaches for texture representation.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Solar neutrinos {{from the}} fusion hep reaction, (helium- 3 fusing with a proton to become helium- 4, {{releasing}} a positron and neutrino), have previously remained undetected {{due to their}} flux being about one one-thousandth that of boron- 8 neutrinos. These neutrinos are interesting theoretically because they are less dependent on solar composition than other solar neutrinos, and therefore provide a somewhat independent test of the Standard Solar Model. In this analysis, we develop a new event fitter for existing data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. We also use the fitter to remove backgrounds that previously limited the fiducial volume, which we increase by 30 %. We use a modified <b>Wald-Wolfowitz</b> <b>test</b> {{to increase the amount}} of live time by 200 days (18 %) and show that this data is consistent with the previously-used data. Finally, we develop a Bayesian analysis technique to make full use of the posterior distributions of energy returned by the event fitter. In the first significant detection of hep neutrinos, we find that the most-probable rate of hep events is 3. 5 x 10 ^ 4 /cm^ 2 /s, which is significantly higher than the theoretical prediction. We find that the 95 % credible region extends from 1. 0 to 7. 2 x 10 ^ 4 /cm^ 2 /s, and that we can therefore exclude a rate of 0 hep events at greater than 95 % probability...|$|E
40|$|The {{adherence}} to classical parametric research methods continues, in part, {{because of the}} misconception of the robustness properties of these procedures to departures from parametric assumptions. It is demonstrated, however, that these procedures are decidedly nonrobust under variance in absence of treatment. Additionally, the performance of these procedures deteriorates under nonnormal distributions. Compared to parametric procedures, nonparametric and distribution-free research methods make minimal assumptions about underlying population data. They are robust to departures from parametric assumptions, and hold distinct power advantages under the most realistic conditions found in the applied research setting, specifically, the condition of concomitant heteroscedasticity and treatment effect under nonnormal distributions. The selection of nonparametric methods for this investigation was based upon their ability to detect population differences under varying effect and variance conditions. The Wald-Wolfowitz Two-Sample Runs Test, the Rosenbaum Nonparametric Test of Dispersion and Location, and the Savage Test for Positive Random Variables were {{of interest in this}} examination. Six treatment effect sizes, five distributions, and four levels of variance are manipulated via Monte Carlo simulation to examine these methods and to compare their performance with that of their parametric counterparts. Type I error rates for all tests under consideration are established, first under the Gaussian distribution, then for the remaining nonnormal distributions including the uniform, t, exponential, and Cauchy distributions. Next, the power properties of all tests are determined under the condition of treatment in absence of variance under all distributions. By holding the treatment to zero and allowing differing degrees of variation, the robustness properties of traditional parametric tests are examined. Finally, the comparative power of all tests is examined under the condition of heteroscedasticity and treatment effect. The <b>Wald-Wolfowitz</b> <b>test,</b> Rosenbaum 2 ̆ 7 s test, and Savage 2 ̆ 7 s test all exhibit distinct power advantages under mild, moderate, and extreme degrees of variance. Under the condition of moderate variance, and for all treatment effects, it is determined that power superiority is highly distribution dependent. Conversely, under the condition of mild or extreme variance, power superiority is decisive.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIn {{most of the}} {{non-parametric}} methods, only a few general {{assumptions are}} made concerning the underlying distribution of the population from which a certain sample is drawn. One of the most frequent of these assumptions is that of continuity, i. e., that the population from which the sample is drawn possesses a continuous distribution, and, therefore, the probability {{of two or more}} equal observations is zero. Actually, however, due to limitation of measurement, experimental data are such that they must usually be regarded as coming from discontinuous distributions and equal observations will occur. When this is the case, one speaks of the occurrence of "tied" observations, or simply "ties", in the data.

40|$|Testing {{equality}} of two multivariate distributions is a classical problem for which many non-parametric tests {{have been proposed}} over the years. Most of the popular two-sample tests, which are asymptotically distribution-free, are based either on geometric graphs constructed using inter-point distances between the observations (multivariate generalizations of the <b>Wald-Wolfowitz's</b> runs <b>test)</b> or on multivariate data-depth (generalizations of the Mann-Whitney rank test). This paper introduces a general notion of distribution-free graph-based two-sample tests, and provides a unified framework for analyzing and comparing their asymptotic properties. The asymptotic efficiency of a general graph-based test is derived, which relates combinatorial properties of the underlying graph {{to the performance of}} the associated test. As a consequence, it is shown that tests based on geometric graphs such as the Friedman-Rafsky test (1979), the test based on the K-nearest neighbor graph, and the cross-match test of Rosenbaum (2005) have zero asymptotic (Pitman) efficiency against O(N^- 1 / 2) alternatives. Asymptotic efficiencies of the tests based on multivariate depth functions (the Liu-Singh rank sum statistic (1993)) are also derived from the proposed general theory. Applications of these results are illustrated both on synthetic and real datasets. Comment: Major changes. 43 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The analysis and probability predicting of these events can decrease damage of agriculture, horticulture and the others. Furthermore, this phenomenon can have a relation with other thermal indexes.

Then the relationship between first frost dates and thermal index were studied. Best relation was between minimum temperature and return periods of first frost dates. Materials and Methods: The analyzing of first frost dates (origin is March 21) of all synoptic stations of Khorasan Razavi province is subject of this article. At first data of each station were screening. The basic properties such as homogeneity, randomness, stationary, independence and outliers must be tested.

The Kolmogorov – Smirnov goodness of fit test can be used to compare the best distribution. The return periods of first frost dates are major application in frequency analysis.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to empirically test the EMH (efficient market hypothesis) and compare its results to those of a viable agent-based competitor using computational simulation. The models are not directly fit to the data; random walk and agent-based methods of stock price determination are statistically compared using the criteria of stationarity, randomness, and autoregressive behavior. The agent-based approach used, styled the 2 ̆ 2 ant trader 2 ̆ 2 model, {{is based on the}} ant model established by Kirman in his 1993 work 2 ̆ 2 Ants, Rationality, and Recruitment 2 ̆ 2. Daily returns of the Hang Seng and Nikkei 225 indices are used over the periods 1987 - 2007 and 1984 - 2007, respectively. Preliminary simulations run with the agent-based model indicate high sensitivity to parameter changes; parameter imbalances lead to unrealistic growth in returns.

40|$|Objective — {{to develop}} and {{implement}} improved approaches to the diagnosis and tactics of surgical treatment in patients with fractures of the distal tibia metaepiphysis. Material and methods. The study included 126 patients with fractures of distal tibia metaepiphysis of «B» and «C» types who underwent internal fixation with plates in 2005 – 2012. The authors analyzed surgical treatment outcomes within the period from 2. 5 to 9 years (average of 5. 7 – 2. 3 years) of postoperative follow up. Average age of patients was 23. 4 ± 2. 1 years. Patients were divided into the main group (64 patients) and the comparison group (62 patients). In the comparison group, traditional approaches to diagnosis and surgical treatment were used, including standard clinical examination and X-rays of the affected ankle in two views and the median access to the distal tibia metaepiphysis. In the main group, a specially elaborated algorithm for selection of optimal surgical tactics was utilized basing on the improved diagnostics program. Clinical and functional data were assessed by Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and SF- 36 Health Survey. Roentgenological assessment was done by X-rays and CT scans. Statistical significance of the differences was evaluated by <b>Wald-Wolfowitz</b> and Fisher <b>tests.</b> Results. Improved approaches to the tactics of surgical treatment in patients with pylon fractures of «B» and «C» types allowed to reduce the incidence of unsatisfactory anatomical and functional outcomes from 43. 5 % to 28. 1 %.
