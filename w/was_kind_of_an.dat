The dance sequences in the video were choreographed by Nadine [...] "Hi-Hat" [...] Ruffin, and are said to incorporate ballet, popping and locking, tribal dance and moves {{similar to the ones}} in the eighties drama Flashdance. Talking about her dancing in the video, Shakira said, [...] "I start doing all kinds of outrageous stuff and hanging upside down and doing stuff that wasn't planned.

The video for the Spanish-language translation [...] "Loba" [...] was released on the same day.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his thought}} process towards the material, Vaughn {{said he was}} {{motivated}} by [...] "unfinished business" [...] with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both X-Men: The Last Stand and Thor. Vaughn declared {{that he was more}} enthusiastic about First Class than The Last Stand due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to [...] "start fresh", while [...] "nodding towards" [...] the successful elements from those films. Vaughn compared First Class to both Batman Begins (2005), which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach, and the 2009 Star Trek film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast. Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was [...] "to make as good a film that could stand on its own two feet regardless of all the other films" [...] and also that could [...] "reboot and start a whole new X-Men franchise". Goldman added the film <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> [...] "alternate history" [...] for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers {{did not want to go}} fully [...] "against the canon of the X-Men trilogy", comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.|$|E
500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E

For it, Todd Rundgren, an early musical {{inspiration}} for Graffin, {{was brought in}} to produce. [...] "Todd <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." [...] In the summer of 2000, they set out on a 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Unfortunately, the experience might not have been all that Greg {{and the rest of the}} band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, [...] "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything." [...] However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies).|$|E
2500|$|In 1971 after Wozniak began {{attending}} University of California, Berkeley, Jobs {{would visit}} him {{there a few}} times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University's student union. Jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for Homestead's avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as [...] "kind of a brain and kind of a hippie ... but he never fit into either group. He was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in. and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect." [...] By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann. In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al. During the summer, Brennan, Jobs, and Steve Wozniak found an advertisement posted on the De Anza College bulletin board for a job that required people to dress up as characters from Alice in Wonderland. Brennan portrayed Alice while Wozniak, Jobs, and Al portrayed the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter.|$|E
