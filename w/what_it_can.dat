5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

25|$|When workers {{hunt for}} arthropods, they fly {{from side to}} side about half a meter off of the ground. Visual cues are used to {{determine}} where to search for prey, whereas olfactory cues are used to determine that prey is near, and elicit landing. Green and brown caterpillars are the most common prey for P. sericea. Once a caterpillar or other insect has been found, workers bite the insect behind the head. They will then drag the prey up onto a twig or a piece of grass, or will sometimes fly the insect to a different location; they do this in order to keep ants or other insects from stealing their prey. Once the insect is in a safe location, the wasp will malaxate the prey, or soften it by mixing it with a thinner substance, presumably saliva. The worker will then bring <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> back to the nest to feed other individuals. If prey is too large to bring back to the nest, foragers will leave the prey, and fly in side to side arcs back to the nest to recruit other workers to help carry the load.|$|E
25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>can,</b> and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E

Sheffield portrayed Sega's mistakes with the Saturn as emblematic of the broader decline of the Japanese gaming industry: [...] "They thought they were invincible, and that structure and hierarchy were necessary for their survival, but more flexibility, and a greater participation with the West could have saved them." [...] According to Stuart, Sega [...] "didn't see... the roots of a prevailing trend, away from arcade conversions and traditional role-playing adventures and toward a much wider console development community with fresh ideas about gameplay and structure."

500|$|During the Second Reading of the NCMP bill, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{presented}} to Parliament three main justifications for the NCMP scheme. First, {{he said that}} having a minimum number of opposition members in Parliament through the NCMP scheme would provide younger People's Action Party ("PAP") MPs with sparring partners to [...] "sharpen their debating skills". Secondly, the presence of opposition members in Parliament would educate the younger generation of voters {{about the role of}} a constitutional opposition and the limits of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> do. He said this was especially important because the younger generation who had not lived and witnessed the conflicts within Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s [...] "harbour myths about the role of an Opposition" [...] and [...] "had no idea how destructive an Opposition could be". Thirdly, the presence of non-PAP MPs in Parliament would act as a check and balance against any governmental impropriety. According to Lee, [...] "some non-PAP MPs will ensure that every suspicion, every rumour of misconduct, will be reported to the non-PAP MPs". The readiness of non-PAP members to bring forth any allegation of misfeasance, or corruption, or nepotism would [...] "dispel suspicions of cover-ups of alleged wrongdoings".|$|E

Jean Bentley of MTV found the episode representative of the first season as a whole, explaining: [...] "Much like the entire first year of the show, the uneven episode started out with a promising, action-packed plot, impressed with a couple of flashy musical numbers, then got too cheesy for its own good and petered out with an overly sentimental song." [...] Fellow MTV writer Aly Semigran noted: [...] "I was hoping for a little more excitement from the episode, though it all did feel very full circle for so many of our characters we've come to know and love.
