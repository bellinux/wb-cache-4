50|$|The {{object to}} be weighed {{is placed on}} one plate, and {{calibrated}} masses are added to and subtracted from the other plate until level is reached. The mass of the object {{is equal to the}} mass of the calibrated masses regardless of where on the plates items are placed. Since the vertical beams are always vertical, and the <b>weighing</b> <b>platforms</b> always horizontal, the potential energy lost by a weight as its platform goes down a certain distance will always be the same, so it makes no difference where the weight is placed. For maximum accuracy, Roberval balances require that their top fulcrum be placed on the line between the left and right pivot so that tipping will not result in the net transfer of weight to either the left or right side of the scale: a fulcrum placed below the idea pivot point will tend to cause a net shift in the direction of any downward-moving vertical column (in a kind of positive feedback loop); likewise, a fulcrum placed above this point will tend to level out the arms of the balance rather than respond to small changes in weight (in a negative feedback loop).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new type of {{equation}} to describe the growth patterns of procellariiform seabirds and other species whose chicks characteristically lose mass {{towards the end of the}} rearing period. Our equation is based on the Gompertz curve; our principles are also applicable to logistic and von Bertalanffy curves. From our model, five coefficients can be derived to characterise the patterns of growth. These are: growth rate, peak mass and age at which it is attained, loss rate and an index describing the overall shape of the curve. We illustrate the use of this new equation with data collected, using automated <b>weighing</b> <b>platforms,</b> on six years of chick growth of Black-browed Diomedea melanophris and Grey-headed D. chrysostoma albatrosses at Bird Island, South Georgia. In comparison with Grey-headed Albatross, Black-browed Albatross chicks grow at a faster rate and to a higher peak mass; they also reach their peak mass at an earlier age, and lose mass at a faster rate in the mass recession period. However, in both species, chicks reached peak mass when 72 % of the rearing period had elapsed; within species, only this did not vary between years. This new equation not only enables the period of mass recession to be incorporated into growth analysis, but, because it does not require assumptions about asymptotic mass, greatly facilitates inter-species comparisons...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDetecting lame cows is {{important}} in improving animal welfare. Automated tools are potentially useful to enable identification and monitoring of lame cows. The goals {{of this study were}} to evaluate the suitability of various physiological and behavioral parameters to automatically detect lameness in dairy cows housed in a cubicle barn. Lame cows suffering from a claw horn lesion (sole ulcer or white line disease) of one claw of the same hind limb (n= 32; group L) and 10 nonlame healthy cows (group C) were included in this study. Lying and standing behavior at night by tridimensional accelerometers, weight distribution between hind limbs by the 4 -scale <b>weighing</b> <b>platform,</b> feeding behavior at night by the nose band sensor, and heart activity by the Polar device (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) were assessed. Either the entire data set or parts of the data collected over a 48 -h period were used for statistical analysis, depending upon the parameter in question. The standing time at night over 12 h and the limb weight ratio (LWR) were significantly higher in group C as compared with group L, whereas the lying time at night over 12 h, the mean limb difference (△weight), and the standard deviation (SD) of the weight applied on the limb taking less weight were significantly lower in group C as compared with group L. No significant difference was noted between the groups for the parameters of heart activity and feeding behavior at night. The locomotion score of cows in group L was positively correlated with the lying time and △weight, whereas it was negatively correlated with LWR and SD. The highest sensitivity (0. 97) for lameness detection was found for the parameter SD [specificity of 0. 80 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 84]. The highest specificity (0. 90) for lameness detection was present for Δweight (sensitivity= 0. 78; AUC= 0. 88) and LWR (sensitivity= 0. 81; AUC= 0. 87). The model considering the data of SD together with lying time at night was the best predictor of cows being lame, accounting for 40 % of the variation in the likelihood of a cow being lame (sensitivity= 0. 94; specificity= 0. 80; AUC= 0. 86). In conclusion, the data derived from the 4 -scale-weighing platform, either alone or combined with the lying time at night over 12 h, represent the most valuable parameters for automated identification of lame cows suffering from a claw horn lesion of one individual hind limb...|$|E
40|$|To improve {{management}} on dairy herds, sensor {{systems have}} been developed that can measure physiological, behavioral, and production indicators on individual cows. It is not known whether using sensor systems also improves measures of health and production in dairy herds. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of using sensor systems on measures of health and production in dairy herds. Data of 414 Dutch dairy farms with (n =  152) and without (n =  262) sensor systems were available. For these herds, information on milk production per cow, days to first service, first calving age, and somatic cell count (SCC) was provided for the years 2003 to 2013. Moreover, year of investment in sensor systems was available. For every farm year, we determined whether that year was before or after the year of investment in sensor systems on farms with an automatic milking system (AMS) or a conventional milking system (CMS), or whether it was a year on a farm that never invested in sensor systems. Separate statistical analyses were performed to determine the effect of sensor systems for mastitis detection (color, SCC, electrical conductivity, and lactate dehydrogenase sensors), estrus detection for dairy cows, estrus detection for young stock, and other sensor systems (<b>weighing</b> <b>platform,</b> rumination time sensor, fat and protein sensor, temperature sensor, milk temperature sensor, urea sensor, β-hydroxybutyrate sensor, and other sensor systems). The AMS farms had a higher average SCC (by 12, 000  cells/mL) after sensor investment, and CMS farms with a mastitis detection system had a lower average SCC (by 10, 000  cells/mL) in the years after sensor investment. Having sensor systems was associated with a higher average production per cow on AMS farms, and with a lower average production per cow on CMS farms in the years after investment. The most likely reason for this lower milk production after investment was that on 96 % of CMS farms, the sensor system investment occurred together with another major change at the farm, such as a new barn or a new milking system. Most likely, these other changes had led to a decrease in milk production that could not be compensated for by the use of sensor systems. Having estrus detection sensor systems did not improve reproduction performance. Labor reduction was an important reason for investing in sensor systems. Therefore, economic benefits from investments in sensor systems can be expected more from the reduction in labor costs than from improvements in measures of health and production in dairy herds...|$|E

40|$|During the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), {{automated}} {{measurements of}} snow water equivalent (SWE) {{were made at}} the Sodankylä (Finland), Weissfluhjoch (Switzerland) and Caribou Creek (Canada) SPICE sites during the northern hemispheric winters of 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15. Supplementary intercomparison measurements were made at Fortress Mountain (Kananaskis, Canada) during the 2013 / 14 winter. The objectives of this analysis are to compare automated SWE measurements with a reference, comment on their performance and, where possible, to make recommendations on how to best use the instruments and interpret their measurements. Sodankylä, Caribou Creek and Fortress Mountain hosted a Campbell Scientific CS 725 passive gamma radiation SWE sensor. Sodankylä and Weissfluhjoch hosted a Sommer Messtechnik SSG 1000 snow scale. The CS 725 operating principle is based on measuring the attenuation of soil emitted gamma radiation by the snowpack and relating the attenuation to SWE. The SSG 1000 measures {{the mass of the}} overlying snowpack directly by using a <b>weighing</b> <b>platform</b> and load cell. Manual SWE measurements were obtained at the intercomparison sites on a bi-weekly basis over the accumulation–ablation periods using bulk density samplers. These manual measurements are considered to be the reference for the intercomparison. Results from Sodankylä and Caribou Creek showed that the CS 725 generally overestimates SWE as compared to manual measurements by roughly 30 – 35  % with correlations (r 2) as high as 0. 99 for Sodankylä and 0. 90 for Caribou Creek. The RMSE varied from 30 to 43  mm water equivalent (mm w. e.) and from 18 to 25  mm w. e. at Sodankylä and Caribou Creek, which had respective SWE maximums of approximately 200 and 120  mm w. e. The correlation at Fortress Mountain was 0. 94 (RMSE of 48  mm w. e. with a maximum SWE of approximately 650  mm w. e.) with no systematic overestimation. The SSG 1000 snow scale, having a different measurement principle, agreed quite closely with the manual measurements at Sodankylä and Weissfluhjoch throughout the periods when data were available (r 2 as high as 0. 99 and RMSE from 8 to 24  mm w. e. at Sodankylä and from 56 to 59  mm w. e. at Weissfluhjoch, where maximum SWE was approximately 850  mm w. e.). When the SSG 1000 was compared to the CS 725 at Sodankylä, the agreement was linear until the start of ablation when the positive bias in the CS 725 increases substantially relative to the SSG 1000. Since both Caribou Creek and Sodankylä have sandy soil, water from the snowpack readily infiltrates into the soil during melt, even if the soil is frozen. However, the CS 725 does not differentiate this water from the unmelted snow. This issue can be identified, at least during the late spring ablation period, with soil moisture and temperature observations like those measured at Caribou Creek. With a less permeable soil and surface runoff, the increase in the instrument bias during ablation is not as significant, as shown by the Fortress Mountain intercomparison...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{now make}} it possible to continuously record and monitor a range of outcomes on dairy farms including individual cow milk yields, environmental temperature and rainfall. These facilities enhance the ability of herd managers to recognise deviations from what is accepted as normal, prompting timely corrective intervention. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how liveweights recorded using walkover weighing (WoW) technology can provide information {{that can be used to}} better-manage a range of activities on dairy farms, particularly reproduction and herd health. Analysis of daily WoW recorded over the first 100 days of lactation have shown that the standard deviation of daily LW measurements across parities was 17 kg on average. A near perfect association between liveweights measured statically and WoWs (concordance correlation coefficient 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 99 to 1. 0) was observed. After controlling for the effect of liveweight at calving and long term liveweight change using a mixed-effects linear regression model, the autocorrelation between WoWs recorded on successive days was 0. 21, decaying to zero by eight days. This study showed that by using a standalone automatic WoW system positioned in the exit race of a rotary milking parlour, it was possible to record LWs of individual cows on a daily basis and, with controlled cow flow over the <b>weighing</b> <b>platform</b> (allowing for sufficient succession distance to prevent congestion), results were similar to those recorded using conventional, static weighing techniques. Two observational studies were conducted to investigate the relationships between LW, LWchange (LW) and clinical lameness. In the first study, LW loss in the first 50 days in milk increased the risk of a lameness event being diagnosed after 50 days in milk by a factor of 1. 80 (95 % CI 1. 00 to 3. 17). The risk of lameness was greatest for high yielding cows that lost excessive LW (risk ratio 4. 36, 95 % CI 4. 21 to 8. 19). The second study quantified LW immediately before and after the diagnosis of lameness events. For lame cows, liveweight decreased up to three weeks before the date of diagnosis and for up to four weeks after. The total liveweight loss arising from a single lameness episode was, on average, 61 kg (95 % CI 47 to 74 kg). The results of this study show how liveweight records for individual animals can be used to enhance a herd manager’s ability to detect lame cows and present them for treatment. Prompt detection and treatment of lame cows presents an opportunity to shorten recovery times, with positive follow-on effects in terms of animal welfare. LW was assessed as a means for enahancing the sensitivity and specificity of oestrus detection. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting true oestrus events using LW combined with tail paint and visual observation was 0. 86 and 0. 94, respectively. The effect of LW in the first four weeks after calving (LWlong) and LW change around the time of the Planned Start of Mating (LWshort) on the time taken for cows to conceive relative to the Planned Start of Mating was quantified. Planned Start of Mating to conception intervals were influenced by LW change during both of these periods, though LWshort had a greater effect compared with LWlong. The findings of this study better define the impact of long- and short-term liveweight change on reproductive performance, providing the opportunity to design feeding programmes in pasture fed dairy herds that have positive effects on fertility. The studies presented in this thesis contribute knowledge to the role of LWmonitoring as a tool to better-manage seasonally calving, pasture fed dairy herds. While ‘traditional’ usage of walkover scales on dairy farms has involved the recording of LWand LWchange as a means for monitoring and adapting changes to the herd feeding program, the studies presented here have shown how LW records have the potential to provide information that can be used to better manage a range of herd level activities, particularly those related to reproductive management and health...|$|E

40|$|The {{probability}} of successful breeding by Brent geese in the Arctic {{appears to be}} positively correlated with the mass of females when they depart from spring staging areas in North-western Europe. To clarify the mechanism behind this relationship we investigated the significance of flown-in female body stores for breeding over six summer seasons (1990 - 1995) in the Pyasina Delta in Taimyr, Russia. Female Brent Geese were caught upon arrival on the breeding grounds. Changes in female body mass and the timing and duration of nest recesses were recorded via electronic <b>weighing</b> <b>platforms</b> placed under their nests. Average female body masses declined through the breeding season; from 1464 g at arrival to 1269 g after egg laying and 1066 g at hatching, {{which was supposed to}} be close to lean body mass. Thus half of the stores were used between arrival and clutch completion, the other half during incubation. All females foraged during incubation. On average they left the nest 13. 1 times every 24 hours, resulting in a daily recess time of 198 min during the first 21 days of incubation. Females were less likely to leave the nest during the last three days of incubation. Leaving the nest was risky: 40 % of the Brent Goose nests in the study area lost one or more eggs to gulls during absence of the female. We estimated that 52 % of the energy required during incubation was derived from body stores and the rest (48 %) from food intake...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} the parental {{division of labour}} and the pattern and rate of parental provisioning by two sympatric species of albatross of similar mass and breeding timetable but differing in diet and in the duration of chick-rearing. Using electronic <b>weighing</b> <b>platforms</b> inside artificial nests, we recorded chick mass of Black-browed Albatross and Grey-headed Albatross at Bird Island, South Georgia every 10 minutes for both species in 1993 and 1994 and for each species in two other years between 1990 and 1996. The chick mass data (nearly one million weighings) were used to calculate meal mass (over 5000 meals) and intervals between meals. Adult birds were fitted with radio-transmitters which allowed each meal to be allocated to the appropriate parent. The combination of meal mass and foraging trip duration were used to calculate provisioning rates for chicks and individual adults. Overall, Black-browed Albatrosses delivered significantly lighter meals (569 g) than Grey-headed Albatrosses (616 g) but more frequently (every 2. 07 days and 2. 50 days respectively). Thus combining foraging trip data for both parents, Black-browed Albatross chicks received a meal every 1. 22 days compared with 1. 26 days for Greyheaded Albatross. These rates did not differ significantly. The contribution of each sex of each species in chick provisioning fluctuated between years, being similar in some years or biased towards males in others. Chicks of both species that failed to fledge received smaller, less frequent meals than successful chicks. In 1990 and 1994, Black-browed Albatross chick provisioning rates were lower than in 1992 and 1993. In 1990, both meal mass and trip duration were affected, but only in 1994 was trip duration longer. Greyheaded Albatross chick provisioning rate was lower in 1994 than in other years but trip duration was longer. In each species, significant changes in meal mass and trip duration occurred within the chick-rearing period. Chick provisioning rates invariably declined before chicks attained their peak mass. For both species, chick growth rates and peak and fledging mass, but not fledging age, were affected by differences in provisioning rate...|$|R

50|$|The Grove MZ 90 CR {{elevated}} work <b>platform</b> <b>weighed</b> 20 tonnes. Equipped with caterpillar tracks, {{it had a}} {{top speed}} of approximately 1 km/h. The platform had been parked {{on the south side of}} the railway line, and was to be driven to a point north of the railway where it was to be loaded onto a lorry. The operator waited until a train had passed before he started to cross, believing he had sufficient time to do so. Unknown to the operator, the next train was due in six minutes; the operator assumed he had approximately ten minutes. Unlike those in the United Kingdom, level crossings in the Netherlands provide no guidance for operators of large and/or slow vehicles, nor was a telephone link to a signalman provided. Thus the platform operator had no way of ascertaining that it was safe to cross.|$|R
5000|$|A 1913 Royal Navy Torpedo School report {{described}} a device intended for countermining, a [...] "dropping mine". At Admiral John Jellicoe's request, the standard Mark II mine was {{fitted with a}} hydrostatic pistol (developed in 1914 by Thomas Firth and Sons of Sheffield) preset for 45 ft firing, to be launched from a stern <b>platform.</b> <b>Weighing</b> 1150 lb, and effective at 100 ft, the [...] "cruiser mine" [...] was a potential hazard to the dropping ship. The design work {{was carried out by}} Herbert Taylor at the RN Torpedo and Mine School, HMS Vernon. The first effective depth charge, the Type D, became available in January 1916. It was a barrel-like casing containing a high explosive (usually TNT, but amatol was also used when TNT became scarce). There were initially two sizes—Type D, with a 300 lb charge for fast ships, and Type D* with a 120 lb charge for ships too slow to leave the danger area before the more powerful charge detonated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{structure}} {{needs to}} be lifted-off from the ground during the weighing progress. For that the weighing fulcrum and the building fulcrum are different and the building fulcrum is fewer usually and the weighing system has some asynchronism during the lifting process of the structure, {{it is very important}} to measure the stress of the key points of the structure during the weighing progress. The paper uses finite element analysis to get the stress sensitive of the weighing device while weighing and uses the optical fiber sensor technology to measure the dynamic stress. Through the experiment with the weighing test bench show that the optical fiber sensor technology has a clear advantage to the traditional resistance strain gauge technique. Instruction The marine structures need to be weighed after finish building on the site to get the accurately barycentric coordinates and the weight parameter. The method is using the hydraulic jack to lift-off the structure from the ground. Then get the mechanical parameters of each point through the sensor. There is too much risk in local stress when weighing because the weighing fulcrum and the building fulcrum are different and the building fulcrum is fewer usually and the weighing system has some asynchronism during the lifting process of the structure. To research the stress measurement techniques for the large structure during the weighing process has important theoretical significance and practical value. The traditional resistance strain measurement technique is that fix the foil gauge on the structure with the glue. But the method is easy to be disturbed by the temperature, humidness and magnetic field and so on. So it is difficult to measure long. Optical fiber sensor is a new type sensor which developed in recent years. It can maintain high accuracy continuous measurement when many factors, such as temperature, humidness and magnetic field and so on, are strong.

40|$|Abstract. According to Chinese {{traditional}} classification, large-sized jackets weight over 10, 000 {{tons and}} stand in over 100 -meter water. Large-sized jackets {{are different from the}} normal in construction tonnage, structural dimension and quality control requirements as well as construction difficulty. More complicated construction technology and programme, higher grade of materials, stricter control requirements on node weld and higher risks all need matched stricter, more meticulous and more comprehensive management in planning and scheduling. Combined with construction of LW 3 - 1 deep-water jacket, this paper describes the planning, tracking progress, process control and optimization. Foreword LW 3 - 1 jacket is the first 30, 000 -ton grade project in China constructed by COOEC(Qingdao). And this large-sized jacket weighing nearly 32, 000 tons has eight legs, sixteen skirt piles and is 201. 5 meters high. With the horizontal type construction method, the top point of jacket is 105 meters high from the ground. After the completion of land construction, LW 3 - 1 jacket will go to sea {{and stand in}} the South China Sea, 260 kilometers away from southeast of Hong Kong and will hold up the LW 3 - 1 CEP <b>platform</b> <b>weighing</b> nearly 28, 000 tons. It’s the largest in Asia, the fifth largest steel jacket i...|$|R
