5|$|Grimaldi and Engel, {{reviewing}} the phylogeny in 2005, commented that many cladistic studies {{had been made}} with no stability in Ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders; the traditional division into Schistonota and Pannota <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> because Pannota {{is derived from the}} Schistonota.|$|E
5000|$|The {{architectural}} historian Nikolaus Pevsner {{was very}} critical of the building's architecture, saying: [...] "The scale <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> the symmetry <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> The proximity to a classical façade put up by the same firm {{at the same time}} <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the goings-on of a store behind such a façade (and below those twisted Tudor chimneys) <b>are</b> <b>wrongest</b> of all".|$|R

5|$|Although {{one of the}} plaintiffs' witnesses, a {{chartered}} land surveyor, {{had suggested}} that the authorities could redevelop the land in a different manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> or indefensible. The court {{was not in a}} position to decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better. Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} that something <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio {{contact with the}} posts, {{and drove to the}} bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E

5|$|While {{reviewing}} the O'Dell case, Veronica notices that the TV station the dean {{was watching the}} night he was murdered had moved its programming back an hour, meaning their estimated time of death <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> The forensic results about the prints in O'Dell’s room come back, {{and they are the}} fingerprints of Steve Botando (Richard Grieco). Steve Botando is investigated by Sheriff Lamb.|$|E
5|$|Working with Edward W. Washburn {{from the}} Bureau of Standards, Urey {{subsequently}} discovered {{the reason for}} the anomalous sample. Brickwedde's hydrogen had been separated from water by electrolysis, resulting in depleted sample. Moreover, Francis William Aston now reported that his calculated value for the atomic weight of hydrogen <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> thereby invalidating Birge and Menzel's original reasoning. The discovery of deuterium stood, however.|$|E
5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> in communism was due to them.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} opening ceremony, United States {{broadcaster}} NBC was criticised for its coverage, as omitting performers less-known in the US. John Clarke, writing for Forbes, said it <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> not to air performances from Ray Davies and Muse, as well as delaying the performance from The Who by an hour to broadcast the pilot of the sitcom Animal Practice followed by the late local news. While in New Zealand, Prime TV were also criticised for delayed coverage, running 20 minutes behind Sky Sport. In the Philippines, TV5 was also criticised because it only aired the first hour of coverage of the ceremony and highlights were incorporated into its morning news programme, Good Morning Club.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, the CGI cutscenes were created by Digital Frontier. The staff numbers, including those working on the cutscenes, went from around one hundred for Path of Radiance to around 200 for Radiant Dawn: half the staff worked on the game itself, while the other half worked on the cutscenes. For the cutscenes, Digital Frontier were asked to show a more epic scope rather than just focusing on the characters, a trend from Path of Radiance the developers felt <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> All of the character movements in cutscenes were mapped using motion capture, with between 100 and 150 animations per character to implement.|$|E
5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E

5000|$|The Frege-Geach problem [...] - [...] {{named for}} Peter Geach, who {{developed}} {{it from the}} writings of Gottlob Frege [...] - [...] claims that by subscribing to Expressivism one necessarily accepts that the meaning of [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies" [...] {{is different from the}} meaning of the [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies" [...] part of the conditional [...] "If it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies, then it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to get your little brother to lie", and that therefore Expressivism is an inadequate explanation for moral language.|$|R
5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Bok was {{aided by}} people of diverse {{cultures}} and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum. Upon arriving in Khartoum, Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman {{and members of the}} Fur people, and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church. His first point of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Cobra {{was adapted}} into an anime series titled Space Cobra {{directed}} by Dezaki and Yoshio Takeuchi that aired on Fuji Television between October 7, 1982, and May 19, 1983. Terasawa himself participated on weekly meetings {{to discuss the}} screenplays, giving his suggestions to the writers to fix what he told <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> or rewriting himself the screenplay. The episodes were released in eight DVDs and a DVD box set on October 25, 2000 by Digital Site in Japan. The series was released in Northern America by Nozomi Entertainment in two parts; the first was released on March 4, 2014, and the second one is available since May 6, 2014. In November 2015, the series {{was added to the}} Crunchyroll streaming service to be broadcast in the United States and Canada with English substitles.|$|E

5|$|Davos Seaworth confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre {{admits to}} burning Shireen alive, but {{points out that}} she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was {{defeated}} anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her {{to admit that she}} <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Davos requests permission from Jon Snow to execute Melisandre, but she counters that she will be useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon exiles Melisandre from the North and threatens to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa Stark discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other.|$|E
5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with the Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of}} the most significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Compton {{moved to}} the University of Chicago as Professor of Physics, a {{position}} he would occupy for the next 22 years. In 1925, he demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized, a result predicted by J. J. Thomson. William Duane from Harvard University spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Duane carried {{out a series of}} experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E
