5|$|Some {{parts of}} the game require timed {{responses}} from players, often leading to significant decisions that impact the game's story. Some conversation trees require players to select a response within a limited time, otherwise Reza remains silent. The game also requires action choices, wherein players must {{decide what to do}} in specific circumstances; for example, one sequences tasks players with choosing <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> aggression during a protest, or to take photographs. Other characters will respond to the decisions accordingly, and a notification feature indicates that a character will remember the selected response. In action-based sequences, players follow on-screen prompts for quick time events in order to stay alive. Should players fail to follow the prompts in the allocated time, the game restarts from prior to the quick time event.|$|E

The northern units of the IRA largely supported the Free State side in the Civil War because of Collins's policies, and over 500 of them joined the new Free State's National Army.|$|E
25|$|The card {{allowed a}} {{two-dimensional}} pricing schedule, {{which consists of}} card price (a fixed cost), and ticket price (a variable cost). Once a passenger has bought a card, its price becomes a sunk cost and this makes the train more like the automobile, which is also characterised by high fixed costs. The decision <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a car or train for a particular journey depends mostly on the marginal price per kilometer, not on the total cost.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln {{was inaugurated}} as president. He was almost {{immediately}} {{confronted with the}} surprise information that Major Anderson was reporting that only six weeks of rations remained at Fort Sumter. A crisis {{similar to the one}} at Fort Sumter had emerged at Pensacola, Florida, where Confederates threatened another U.S. fortificationFort Pickens. Lincoln and his new cabinet struggled with the decisions of whether to reinforce the forts, and how. They were also concerned about <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> actions that might start open hostilities and which side would be perceived as the aggressor as a result. Similar discussions and concerns were occurring in the Confederacy.|$|E

25|$|Admiral of the Fleet Sir (George) Rodney Mundy, GCB (19 April 1805 – 23 December 1884) was a Royal Navy officer. As a commander, {{he persuaded}} the Dutch to {{surrender}} Antwerp during the Belgian Revolution and then {{acted as a}} mediator during negotiations between the Dutch and the Belgians to end hostilities. As a captain, he was deployed to the East Indies Station and was asked to keep the Sultan of Brunei in line until the British Government made a final decision on <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the island of Labuan: he took the Sultan's son-in-law, Pengiran Mumin, to witness the island's accession to the British Crown in December 1846. He was then deployed to the seas of Finland, where he secured Björkö Sound in operations against Russia during the Crimean War.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to captain on 10 January 1837, {{he became}} {{commanding}} officer of the sixth-rate HMS Iris in the West Africa Squadron in October 1842. He was then re-deployed with HMS Iris to the East Indies Station and was involved in operations under Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane. Mundy was asked to keep the Sultan of Brunei in line until the British Government made a final decision on <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the island of Labuan: he took the Sultan's son-in-law, Pengiran Mumin, to witness the island's accession to the British Crown on 24 December 1846. Some sources state that during {{the signing of the}} treaty, the Sultan had been threatened by a British navy warship ready to fire on the Sultan's palace if he refused to sign the treaty while another source says the island was ceded to Britain as a reward for assistance in combating pirates.|$|E
25|$|The Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia {{opened on}} {{schedule}} at 8:00 AM on December 28. The $286 million extension added 2.88 miles (4.63km) {{to the rail}} system. Although Metro had estimated in September 1991 that 60,000 riders would board daily at the three stations, this number had fallen to just 30,700 riders a day by early December 1991 and to just 28,000 on December 28. Metro estimated 20,000 riders a day would board at Anacostia station alone by late June 1992. Fearing a boycott of the station due to ongoing disputes over bus service in Anacostia (see below), Metro sent large numbers of extra station managers and supervisors into the Anacostia station on the first workday it was open to help commuters decide <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> rail or bus, and which bus routes to take. Metro said 1,854 people boarded at Anacostia, 459 boarded at Waterfront, and 127 boarded at Navy Yard on the first workday.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of agreement, Congress was {{enthusiastic}} about a canal, and was inclined to move forward, {{with or without a}} treaty. [...] Authorizing legislation was slowed by discussion on <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Nicaraguan or Panamanian route. Much of the negotiation of a revised treaty, allowing the U.S. to fortify the canal, took place between Hay's replacement in London, Joseph H. Choate, and the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne, and the second Hay-Pauncefote Treaty was ratified by the Senate by a large margin on December 6, 1901.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Hay took office, {{the war was}} {{effectively}} over {{and it had been}} decided to strip Spain of her overseas empire and transfer at least part of it to the United States.

[...] Spain yielded, and the result was the Treaty of Paris, narrowly ratified by the Senate in February 1899 over the objections of anti-imperialists.|$|E
50|$|The {{rules of}} 600 are {{much the same}} as in Blackjack., with players being {{initially}} dealt two cards and choosing <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> hit (<b>take</b> another card) or stay (receive no more cards). The notable difference between the two games is that in 600, an Ace counts as either 100 points or can multiply the value of the total value of all other cards in a hand by 10. The Ace's multiplier stacks additively, i.e. two aces result in a multiplier of 20.|$|R
40|$|Medication {{adherence}} usually refers <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> patients <b>take</b> their medications as prescribed, {{as well as}} <b>whether</b> {{they continue}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a prescribed medication.

To date, measurement of patient medication adherence and use of interventions to improve adherence are rare in routine clinical practice. The goals of this article are to address (1) the reasons for non-adherence, (2) the prevalence of medication non-adherence, (3) the consequences of non-adherence, (4) patient behaviour with respect to taking medications and finally, (5) interventions to improve medication adherence. peer-reviewe...|$|R

500|$|The {{alternate}} approach taken is the [...] "beneficiary election" [...] approach. This is {{that where}} trust funds are wrongly mixed with the trustee's personal funds, used for an investment, and the money is thus not recoverable, the beneficiaries are allowed to [...] "elect" [...] whether the investment is to be held as a security for the amounts owed to them, or <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the unauthorised investment {{as part of the}} trust fund. This is considered the exception, rather than the rule; in Foskett v McKeown, Millett said that [...] "The primary rule in regard to a mixed fund, therefore, is that gains and losses are borne by the contributors rateably. The beneficiary's right to elect instead to enforce a lien to obtain repayment is an exception to the primary rule, exercisable where the fund is deficient and the claim is made against the wrongdoer and those claiming through him".|$|E
500|$|Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost {{literally}} {{walked into}} his role. He was doing play-by-play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear's partner, Jerry Perenchio. [...] "Lear casually asked if I'd {{be interested in the}} part. I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> that as a compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production.
