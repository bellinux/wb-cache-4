5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{testimony}} of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified {{that they had}} heard Waller declare he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In {{an analysis of the}} transcript, Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors, but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.|$|E
5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E

25|$|Lords {{was born}} Nora Louise Kuzma on May 7, 1968, in Steubenville, Ohio, to Louis and Patricia Kuzma (née Briceland). Her father's parents were {{immigrants}} from Ukraine, {{while her mother}} was of Irish ancestry. Louis was employed as a steelworker. Lords has one elder sister, Lorraine, and two younger sisters, Rachel and Grace. Her father was an alcoholic who would abuse her mother on a regular basis. According to her, he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> drunk and accuse her of having boyfriends in the house. During that time, Lords would often spend time with her grandmother who lived nearby. Her parents divorced when she {{was seven years old}} and Lords moved with her mother and three sisters to her great-grandmother's house. Following their divorce, her father got partial custody. Around that same time, her mother enrolled at the Ohio University and landed only a part-time job.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, the Brunt {{family moved}} to Paddock Wood in Kent and, in his school holidays, [...] "Young John" [...] (as he was known in the village) <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home.</b> Although {{he was still a}} {{reckless}} individual, he was thought of very highly, and helped train the Paddock Wood Home Guard between 1940 and 1943, assisted by his father. He spent his last days in Paddock Wood helping with the hop harvest.|$|E
500|$|Uribe {{was born}} in Baní, Dominican Republic. Growing up, he became {{interested}} in baseball partly due to José Uribe. José was Juan's second cousin, although Juan calls him his [...] "uncle" [...] because of their age difference. When Major League Baseball (MLB) was not in season, José <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> to the Dominican Republic and tell Juan about {{his time in the}} majors playing shortstop for the San Francisco Giants. Juan proved to have baseball ability too. In 1997, Colorado Rockies scout Jorge Posada, Sr., spotted Uribe while he was scouting pitcher Enemencio Pacheco. Posada offered him a $5,000 contract, but Uribe and his father tried to get a higher amount from agent Bob Michelin. Eventually, Uribe settled for $5,000.|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Kamo {{liked to}} get into fights with his peers and <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> beaten. When he was 7, his parents hired a {{personal}} tutor who tried to {{teach him how to}} read and write Russian.|$|E
2500|$|Madhubala had {{ventricular}} septal defect (a hole in her heart) {{which was}} detected {{while she was}} shooting for Bahut Din Huwe in Madras in 1954. By 1960, her condition had aggravated, and her sister explains that [...] "Due to her ailment, her body would produce extra blood, so it would spill out from the nose and mouth. The doctor <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> and extract bottles of blood. She also suffered from pulmonary pressure of the lungs. She coughed all the time. Every four to five hours {{she had to be}} given oxygen or else would get breathless. She was confined to bed for nine years and was reduced to just bones and skin".|$|E
2500|$|Living in {{such close}} {{proximity}} caused numerous frictions between soldiers and residents. In 1679, a magistrate complained that citizens {{had to give}} over [...] "three, four, five or six beds, along with linen and blankets" [...] to [...] "soldiers who were most often violent, drunk, and difficult, who mistreated them [...] stole their linen and furniture, and chased them from their own homes". Ruffian soldiers <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> at night drunk, leaving the house doors open being noisy. The Spanish troops were apparently particularly undisciplined. When lodging in barracks was introduced, discipline improved considerably, though conflicts with residents did not disappear entirely. In the 18th century, there were still examples of Austrian officers who moved into rooms more spacious than the ones they had been assigned; others would bring girls of low repute to their house at night, to the alarm of their civilian landlords.|$|E
6000|$|To the imaginations of Lord Fitzjocelyn and Mr. Frost, {{this was}} fatal delay.

2500|$|It {{was taught}} in a Baraita that Rabbi taught that {{the laws of the}} nazirite in [...] follow {{immediately}} those of the woman accused of being unfaithful in [...] to teach that anyone who sees an unfaithful wife in her ruination should (take a lesson from her ways and) completely abstain from wine (for wine brought her to her end). Similarly, a Midrash taught that when they made the suspected wife drink, they told her that much might have been due to wine. And all the Israelites who had seen it <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> and bemoan the person who had drunk wine, got intoxicated, committed sin, and died. And so they would swear never to taste wine, so that they might not meet the same fate. And the Midrash provided another explanation: Just as the nazirite was separated from wine, so God separated the faithless wife from other women. Similarly, another Midrash taught that wine leads to whoredom. And thus God wrote the section about the nazirite after the section about the suspected wife to indicate that one should not copy the deeds of the adulterer and adulteress who drank wine and disgraced themselves, but that one who is afraid of sin should separate from wine.|$|E

60|$|Where she went, and how {{she managed}} to procure the drink, we never discovered; but the same {{programme}} was repeated every day.
