5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. <b>With</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> a promise that he would issue {{a call to the}} Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E

25|$|In March 2015, Lara criticised the ICC for fining Pakistani cricket player Wahab Riaz {{after his}} 'shocking spell', {{as it was}} dubbed, when he managed to puzzle Australian player Shane Watson by giving him sarcastic claps, {{throwing}} the ball at him and sending him flying kisses. Watson was unable to cope <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> Riaz's high-quality bowling in the 2015 ICC World Cup. The team lost but Riaz was fined 50% of his match fee for his behaviour. Lara criticised this decision by the ICC {{and said it was}} 'uncalled for'. He said it was the only highlights of the game and said he would pay the fine himself. He said he wanted to meet Riaz himself.|$|E
25|$|The next day, General Boris Ivanov who {{was behind}} the mission in Kabul along with General Lev Gorelov and Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Pavlovsky visited Amin to congratulate him on his {{election}} to power. On {{the same day the}} KGB decided to imprison Sayed Gulabzoy as well as Muhammad Watanjar and Asadullah Sarwari but while in captivity and under an investigation all three denied the allegation that the current Minister of Defense was an American secret agent. The denial of claims was passed on to Yuri Andropov and Leonid Brezhnev, who as the main chiefs of the KGB proposed operation Raduga {{to save the life of}} Gulabzoy and Watanjar and send them to Tashkent from Bagram airbase by giving them fake passports. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> a sealed container in which an almost breathless Sarwari was laying, they came to Tashkent on 19 September.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s {{proved to}} be a fallow decade for Brando. He {{directed}} and starred in the cult western film One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of box-office failures, beginning with the 1962 film adaptation of the novel Mutiny on the Bounty. After 10 years, during which he did not appear in a successful film, he won his second Academy Award for playing Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, a role critics consider among his greatest. The Godfather was then one of the most commercially successful films of all time. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris, Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars, placing sixth and tenth in the Money Making Stars poll in 1972 and 1973, respectively. Brando took a four-year hiatus before appearing in The Missouri Breaks (1976). After this, he was content with being a highly paid character actor in cameo roles, such as in Superman (1978) and The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from motion pictures. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7million ($ million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days' work on Superman. He finished out the 1970s with his controversial performance as Colonel Kurtz in another Coppola film, Apocalypse Now, a box-office hit for which he was highly paid and which helped finance his career layoff during the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E

Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. [...] "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that.

[...] Olson was not aware that the producers and writers were working on a Marceline-centric miniseries until the series' head writer, Kent Osborne, casually mentioned it {{to her in a}} conversation; when she learned of this, she reportedly cried because she was so excited. Due to the Marceline-centric nature of the miniseries, a new opening was created that features Olson singing the theme song over a bass guitar.

500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> that's the beautiful thing.

[...] The well-publicized incident (and others like it) increased polarization over the issue of slavery and made Stevens a prominent face of Northern abolitionism.|$|E
