However, diffusion of this technology has been uneven, with countries such as Germany and Sweden taking the lead, but limited diffusion in other countries such as the UK. In this context, this study explores the financial viability of AD in the UK to offer reasons why it has not been more widely used. This paper presents a model that calculates the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on a twenty year investment in a 30, 000 tonnes per annum wet mesophilic AD plant in the UK for the treatment of source separated organic waste, which is judged to be a suitable technology for the UK climate. The model evaluates the financial significance of the different alternative energy outputs from this AD plant and the resulting economic subsidies paid for renewable energy. Results show that renewable electricity and renewable heat sales supported by renewable electricity and renewable heat tariffs generates the greatest IRR (31. 26 %). All other uses of biogas generate an IRR in excess of 15 %, and are judged to be a financially viable investment.

Waste tyres fall under the general solid waste category give rise to land filling, health and environmental challenges. As a result, majority of these waste tyres accumulate in large quantities at landfill sites or end up being illegally disposed in open fields. Thus, sustainable remedial technologies such as pyrolysis which are environmentally friendly must be developed. Pyrolysis offers a number of attractive advantages as a treatment option such as the production of primary and secondary economic valuable products, namely pyrolysis gas, oil, char and steel wires. The objective of this work was {{the development of a}} business model which includes costing, procurement, installation, commissioning and operating a batch pyrolysis plant in Gauteng, South Africa. In addition this work assesses the environmental, socio-economic aspects for waste tyre derived products. The study objectives were achieved through literature research, site visits, telephonic and personal interviews as well as questionnaires. An order of magnitude costing method was used for the construction of the pyrolysis business model. The model showed {{that it is possible to}} operate and sustain a batch pyrolysis plant with a constant supply of waste tyres in the Gauteng region.

40|$|The {{greatest}} threat that the biodegradable waste causes {{on the environment}} is the methane produced in landfills by the decomposition of this waste. The Landfill Directive (1999 / 31 /EC) aims to reduce the landfilling of biodegradable waste. In Finland, 31 % of biodegradable municipal waste ended up into landfills in 2012. The pressure of reducing disposing into landfills is greatly increased by the forthcoming landfill ban on biodegradable waste in Finland. There {{is a need to}} discuss the need for increasing the utilization of biodegradable waste in regional renewable energy production to utilize the waste in a way that allows the best possibilities to reduce GHG emissions. The objectives of the thesis are: (1) to find important factors affecting renewable energy recovery possibilities from biodegradable waste, (2) to determine the main factors affecting the GHG balance of biogas production system and how to improve it and (3) to find ways to define energy performance of biogas production systems and what affects it. According to the thesis, the most important factors affecting the regional renewable energy possibilities from biodegradable waste are: the amount of available feedstock, properties of feedstock, selected utilization technologies, demand of energy and material products and the economic situation of utilizing the feedstocks. The biogas production by anaerobic digestion was seen as the main technology for utilizing biodegradable waste in agriculturally dense areas. The main {{reason for this is that}} manure was seen as the main feedstock, and it can be best utilized with anaerobic digestion, which can produce renewable energy while maintaining the spreading of nutrients on arable land. Biogas plants should be located close to the heat demand that would be enough to receive the produced heat also in the summer months and located close to the agricultural area where the digestate could be utilized. Another option for biogas use is to upgrade it to biomethane, which would require a location close to the natural gas grid. The most attractive masses for biogas production are municipal and industrial biodegradable <b>waste</b> because of <b>gate</b> fees the plant receives from them can provide over 80 % of the income. On the other hand, directing gate fee masses for small-scale biogas plants could make dispersed biogas production more economical. In addition, the combustion of dry agricultural waste such as straw would provide a greater energy amount than utilizing them by anaerobic digestion. The complete energy performance assessment of biogas production system requires the use of more than one system boundary. These can then be used in calculating output–input ratios of biogas production, biogas plant, biogas utilization and biogas production system, which can be used to analyze different parts of the biogas production chain. At the moment, it is difficult to compare different biogas plants since there is a wide variation of definitions for energy performance of biogas production. A more consistent way of analyzing energy performance would allow comparing biogas plants with each other and other recovery systems and finding possible locations for further improvement. Both from the GHG emission balance and energy performance point of view, the energy consumption at the biogas plant was the most significant factor. Renewable energy use to fulfil the parasitic energy demand at the plant would be the most efficient way to reduce the GHG emissions at the plant. The GHG emission reductions could be increased by upgrading biogas to biomethane and displacing natural gas or petrol use in cars when compared to biogas CHP production. The emission reductions from displacing mineral fertilizers with digestate were seen less significant, and the greater N 2 O emissions from spreading digestate might surpass the emission reductions from displacing mineral fertilizers...|$|R

5000|$|Charging {{pressure}} regulation utilises a two coiled three way {{solenoid valve}} pneumatically connected with hoses to the turbo charger’s <b>waste</b> <b>gate,</b> the turbo chargers outlet and the compressor’s inlet. The solenoid valve is electrically supplied from +54 via fuse 13 and {{is controlled by}} the ECU via its pin 26 and pin 2. The control voltage is pulse width modulated (PWM) at 90 Hz below 2500 RPM and 70 Hz above 2500 RPM. The rationale for this change is to avoid resonance phenomena in the pneumatic hoses. By grounding pin2 longer than pin 26 the charging pressure is decreased and vice verse, when pin 26 is grounded longer than pin 2 the charging pressure is increased. To be able to regulate the charging pressure the ECU must at first calculate a requested pressure, a pressure value that the system must strive for. This is done by taking a pre programmed value (matrix of values established in respect of RPM and throttle opening). At WOT the pressure values for each RPM are selected {{to make sure that the}} engine gets the requested torque.|$|E

30|$|Selective {{catalytic}} reduction (SCR) {{is one of}} the most effective ways to reduce NOx emissions and all OEMs have reported activities with this technology since it is the most straight forward way to reach IMO Tier III NOx compliance (see for example Briggs & McCarney 2013; Hanamoto et al. 2013; Hiraoka & Imanaka 2013; Izumi et al. 2013; Murayama et al. 2013; Soikkeli et al. 2013; Steffe et al. 2013). Injected urea in the exhaust pipe vaporizes and decomposes to form ammonia (NH 3), which reacts on the catalytic substrate thereby reducing the NOx to N 2 by as much as 95  %. However, due to cost and layout constraints, it is typically in the region of 80 … 85  %. The total hydrocarbon (THC) and particulate matter emissions are also positively affected. The biggest challenge seen with SCR operation is that exhaust gas temperatures of at least 330 … 350  °C are needed with residual fuels having high sulphur content in order to avoid clogging by the formation of ammonium sulphate. Alternatively, if the exhaust gas temperature is too high, oxidizing of the SO 2 to SO 3 starts to happen in the SCR reactor, forming a so-called “blue haze”, which is visible as a blue exhaust gas plume. As a result, some means of control, such as a <b>waste</b> <b>gate</b> or by-pass arrangement, is needed with an SCR unit to keep the exhaust gas temperatures within a certain range. All engine concepts developed for SCR applications would allow the best possible specific fuel consumption, and in the case of utilising 2 -stage TC systems, would give fuel consumption savings of 4 … 8  % over the entire engine operating range.|$|E

Ziegel Gasser Mattoni GmbH S. r. l., in Natz-Schabs (Naz-Sciaves) {{in the north of}} Italy, is a relatively small manufacturer producing < 20, 000 metric tons of brick per year. In this thesis the economic, environmental and social advantages consequent to a complete review of the approach to the company’s manufacture of cored clay bricks are discussed, including energy saving measures and the use of novel fuel and clay body supplements. A number of wide ranging novel technical modifications to the production processes of the Gasser Brick company have been tested, evaluated, reviewed, compared, and critically evaluated. The approach includes the utilization of a substantial percentage of various wastes as part-substitution of, or as an addition to, quarried raw materials and also the use of renewable and alternative fuels as a substitute for fossil fuels. A number of these modifications have resulted in beneficial changes to the product and the efficiency of the production process and considerably reduced the environmental footprint of the operation.

40|$|International audienceTightening European {{standards}} on fuel consumption and pollutant emissions reduction {{lead to a}} sophistication of engine concepts and associated control. Since few years, downsizing (reduction of the engine displacement) appears as a major way to achieve those requirements for spark ignition engines. Efficient performance and drivability can be then achieved with a direct injection downsized engine with turbocharging and Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT). One of the major issues of the torque-oriented control is in-cylinder mass observation and control. To have an efficient torque response, the in-cylinder trapped mass, adjusted by the throttle and the <b>waste</b> <b>gate,</b> must be controlled with accuracy according to performance and drivability requirements. Depending on admission and exhaust pressures, the twin VCT will allow to control in-cylinder burned gases rate {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and pollutant emissions, and air scavenging to improve transient speed response. Another major issue is in-cylinder trapped mass and air scavenging prediction for AFR control. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to achieve those engine control issues. The first challenge is to design accurate observers for non-measurable variables (in-cylinder burned gases and trapped air mass). The method is based on a complex high frequency 0 D engine model, which has been validated on a large range of engine operating points and transient operations based on test bed results. Then, this model permits to design and learn open-loop nonlinear static observers of in-cylinder masses (based on neural network). The static and dynamic behavior of high frequency 0 D engine model allows to achieve design of dynamic and closed-loop in-cylinder mass observation and prediction, multivariable and non-linear control of air path according to in-cylinder mass trajectory (trapped air mass & recirculated gases rate). Then, the complete engine control can be developed and validated on simulation and on a real time Software-In-the-Loop platform based on high frequency 0 D engine model, before a complete validation and calibration on test bed. Finally, the complete torque-oriented engine control has been integrated on vehicle. From 0 D engine model, a complete vehicle model has been set on real-time platform in order to validate engine control integration and design vehicle layout. The major issue is then supervision of engine control set points (torque, AFR, efficiency) according to engine states (start, idle, driver request, cut-off) and warm-up strategies...|$|E
40|$|The diesel engine, {{because of}} its {{superior}} fuel economy compared with spark ignition engines, has attracted considerable attention. Significant improvement in their performance and engine emissions has been achieved. The use of various advanced internal measures has resulted in significant reduction of pollutant emissions inside the combustion chamber. Nevertheless, considering the increasingly restrictive 'engine-out' emission standards to be adopted, {{it appears that the}} use of air throttling systems is possibly inevitable {{in order to meet the}} future limits. This is because NOx and soot emissions are usually affected in the opposite way from the various internal measures. However, the use of conventional air throttling systems in DI diesel engines is not possible owing to the lean nature of diesel combustion, which does not permit the use of catalysts for controlling NOx emissions. Currently, alternative solutions are proposed focusing on the use of a selective catalytic reduction system, requiring a carefully controlled injection of urea or NOx traps (adsorbers) When the storage capacity of the trap is reached, during normal lean operation, the engine must switch to rich operation in order to produce the necessary reducing agents, that is, CO and H 2, which release the stored NO, to react with CO in a catalyst to finally form N,. In this work, an extended computational investigation has been conducted to examine various strategies for achieving rich combustion in diesel engines. Rich diesel combustion has recently attracted attention for the regeneration of NOx traps. Rich combustion can be achieved using either internal or external measures, (fuel injection at the exhaust manifold). Rich operation is expected to have a negative impact on engine performance and emissions resulting in an increase of brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc), soot and exhaust gas temperature. For this reason, in this work, various strategies are examined for achieving rich combustion using internal measures, namely intake air throttling or/and <b>waste</b> <b>gate</b> operation, EGR and late post injection. The investigation was conducted on a heavy-duty DI diesel engine, using a phenomenological simulation code that is based on a multizone combustion model. Information is provided concerning the impact of the various rich strategies examined on engine performance and emissions. This enables us to estimate the most appropriate one. Using this information, we established a combination of strategies to achieve the lowest possible A value with acceptable overall fuel and soot penalties.
