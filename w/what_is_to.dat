5|$|Player One: <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>to</b> Become of Us {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Douglas Coupland for the 2010 Massey Lectures. Each of the book's five {{chapters}} was delivered as a one-hour lecture in a different Canadian city: Vancouver on October 12, Regina on October 14, Charlottetown on October 19, Ottawa on October 25 and ending in Toronto on October 29. The lectures were broadcast on CBC Radio One's Ideas, November 8–12. The book was published by House of Anansi Press.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>to</b> Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{that are}} {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves. Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs. However, shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is {{severely}} wounded during an RAF air raid in Tunisia, losing his right hand, {{the ring and}} little finger on his left hand, and his left eye, and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the Führers personal airplane. The bomb, however, is a dud and fails to detonate, and Tresckow flies to Berlin in order to safely retrieve it. After learning that the Gestapo has arrested Major General Hans Oster, he orders General Olbricht to find a replacement. After recruiting Stauffenberg into the German Resistance, Olbricht presents Stauffenberg {{at a meeting of}} the secret committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler's life. The members include General Ludwig Beck, Dr. Carl Goerdeler, and Erwin von Witzleben. Stauffenberg is stunned to learn that no plans exist on the subject of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be done after Hitler's assassination.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>to</b> Be Done? (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained {{a source of inspiration}} throughout her life.|$|E

5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar), but much of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} {{to this group}} of works, the Commission express the opinion that an enemy {{will not attempt to}} enter Washington from this direction, and that we cannot (as a general rule) expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{feminism}} {{originated in}} the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and the prominent role of women as a symbol for democracy and freedom in the French Revolution. Notable Russian intellectual figures like Alexander Pushkin and Alexander Herzen wrote positively about the increased power and independence of women in their society and supported the growing concern for gender equality. In his influential novel <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be Done?, the writer Nikolai Chernyshevski embodied the new feminist ideas in the novel's heroine, Vera Pavlovna, who dreams of a future utopian society with perfect equality among the sexes.|$|E
50|$|The LSWR D15 class 4-4-0 was {{the last}} steam {{locomotive}} design by Dugald Drummond for the London and South Western Railway in 1912. By 1912, Dugald Drummond had built several classes of unsuccessful 4-6-0 express passenger locomotives. The result of these failures was that when he designed <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his last class in 1911, a new 4-4-0 design emerged from Eastleigh Works in February 1912, with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the first of his}} D15 class.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the flawed}} plot, the film did give signs of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> come from Jet Li's {{appearances}} in films with modern settings.

5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>to</b> Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
5|$|There are six main plot {{lines that}} the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Each scenario is divided into eight episodes, one interlude episode and an epilogue. At the end of an episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> consist in the next episode. Each episode takes place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one through the epilogue. The interlude episode is placed between the second and third episodes.|$|E
5|$|Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was {{the head}} of {{government}} and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet {{was the head}} of state. The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World, whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World. In the Soviet Union's seventy-year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In the ideology of Vladimir Lenin the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the vanguard party (see <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>to</b> Be Done?).|$|E

5|$|When he is 43, during <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be {{his last}} year of life, Henry time travels to a Chicago parking garage on a frigid winter night where {{he is unable to}} find shelter. As a result of the {{hypothermia}} and frostbite he suffers, his feet are amputated when he returns to the present. Henry and Clare both know that without the ability to escape when he time travels, Henry will certainly die within his next few jumps. On New Year's Eve 2006 Henry time travels {{into the middle of the}} Michigan woods in 1984 and is accidentally shot by Clare's brother, a scene foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Henry returns to the present and dies in Clare's arms.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together to think about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia {{following the end of}} the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

25|$|His {{most salient}} characteristics– a disrespect of conventions, both social and literary, an {{attitude}} of permanent revolt, playfulness with language, {{and the use of}} parody and black humor– are used to form a body of incisive depictions of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be Portuguese and his relation with the country.|$|E
25|$|A {{converse}} of a theorem is {{a statement}} formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be proved. For example, the isosceles triangle theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.|$|E
