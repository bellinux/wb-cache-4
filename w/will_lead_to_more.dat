2500|$|There {{are several}} reasons to expect that climate changes, from {{whatever}} cause, may be enhanced in the Arctic, relative to the mid-latitudes and tropics. First, is the ice-albedo feedback, whereby an initial warming causes snow and ice to melt, exposing darker surfaces that absorb more sunlight, leading to more warming. Second, because colder air holds less water vapour than warmer air, in the Arctic, a greater fraction of any increase in radiation absorbed by the surface goes directly into warming the atmosphere, whereas in the tropics, a greater fraction goes into evaporation. Third, because the Arctic temperature structure inhibits vertical air motions, {{the depth of the}} atmospheric layer that has to warm in order to cause warming of near-surface air is much shallower in the Arctic than in the tropics. Fourth, a reduction in sea-ice extent <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> energy being transferred from the warm ocean to the atmosphere, enhancing the warming. Finally, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns caused by a global temperature change may cause more heat to be transferred to the Arctic, enhancing Arctic warming ( [...] 2004).|$|E

2500|$|This vision {{produces}} a core proposition in textbook neoclassical economics, i.e., that the income earned by each [...] "factor of production" [...] (essentially, labor and [...] "capital") {{is equal to}} its marginal product. Thus, with perfect product and input markets, the wage (divided by {{the price of the}} product) is alleged to equal the marginal physical product of labor. More importantly for the discussion here, the rate of profit (sometimes confused with the rate of interest, i.e., the cost of borrowing funds) is supposed to equal the marginal physical product of capital. (For simplicity, abbreviate [...] "capital goods" [...] as [...] "capital.") A second core proposition is that a change in the price of a factor of production will lead to a change in the use of that factor [...] an increase in the rate of profit (associated with falling wages) <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> of that factor being used in production. The law of diminishing marginal returns implies that greater use of this input will imply a lower marginal product, all else equal: since a firm is getting less from adding a unit of capital goods than is received from the previous one, the rate of profit must increase to encourage the employment of that extra unit, assuming profit maximization.|$|E
