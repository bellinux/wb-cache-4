40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Merrimack College in Massachusetts to compare the grades of students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> the recommended course as determined by their mathematics placement exam score {{and those who did}} not follow this recommendation. The goal was to decide whether the mathematics placement exam used at Merrimack College was effective in placing students in the appropriate mathematics class. During five years, first-year students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> a mathematics course in the fall semester were categorized into four groups: those <b>who</b> <b>took</b> the recommended course, those <b>who</b> <b>took</b> an easier course than recommended, those <b>who</b> <b>took</b> a course more difficult than recommended, and those <b>who</b> did not <b>take</b> the placement test. Chi-square tests showed a statistically significant relationship between course grade (getting a C – or higher grade) and placement advice. The results indicate that students <b>who</b> <b>take</b> the recommended course or an easier one do much better than those <b>who</b> <b>take</b> a higher-level course or do not take the placement exam. With achievement in coursework as the measure of success, we concluded that the placement test is an effective tool for making recommendations to students about which courses they should take. There is a widespread recognition of the need for appropriate placement in the mathematics courses for undergraduate freshmen. Many colleges an...|$|R
