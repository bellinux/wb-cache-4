500|$|Over {{the second}} middle eight, Harrison adapted Taylor's {{suggestion}} to read [...] "You know that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat</b> you are". In the same section, a subsequent line names the track [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", a Paul McCartney composition {{that would also}} appear on The Beatles. In this way, [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] continued a tradition initiated by John Lennon in 1967, particularly in his lyrics to [...] "I Am the Walrus", whereby the Beatles deliberately quoted from their previous songs.|$|E
500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] as {{a tribute}} to Clapton's {{chocolate}} addiction. He derived the title and much of the lyrics from a box of Mackintosh's Good News chocolates, which Clapton began eating during one of his visits to Harrison's home. Many of the confectionery names used in the song are authentic; others, such as cherry cream, coconut fudge and pineapple heart, were Harrison's invention, based on the flavours listed inside the lid of the box. For the lyrics to the second of the song's middle eight sections, Harrison received assistance from Derek Taylor, the press officer for the Beatles' new record label, Apple Records. In keeping with the theme of Harrison's composition, Taylor drew inspiration from the title of the American counterculture film You Are <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Eat,</b> which was itself titled after a fashionable macrobiotic slogan.|$|E
500|$|The {{last bit}} of news {{yesterday}} morning is the King's anger against Eliza Wednesday (yesterday) night for being impudent to him. He threw a chair at her head and a spitoon also, which made a great cut {{on the side of}} her head. The nearest Doctor was sent for [...] both McGrew and McKibbin arrived. It seems the King told her to come to bed — she replied what right has a dog or a bitch there, which instantly gave vent to his ill temper that he had been brooding some days, and used a word of four letters belonging only to Waterclosets. She retorted, [...] "Oh, I suppose that is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat</b> to exist on." [...] This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [...] threw the articles at her head. I had intended to call yesterday to see how he continues to improve, but this domestic fracas of the Royal household puts it out of the question, till a few days more when the King will be settled and not so upset.|$|E

2500|$|Rodney Stark {{argues that}} [...] "the {{fundamental}} problem facing Muslim theologians vis-à-vis {{the morality of}} slavery is that Muhammad bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves", though he states that Muhammad did advise that slaves be treated well: [...] "Feed them <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat</b> yourself and clothe them with what you wear...They are God's people like unto you and be kind unto them". In addition, Stark contrasts Islam with Christianity, implying that Christian theologians wouldn't {{have been able to}} [...] "work their way around the biblical acceptance of slavery" [...] if Jesus had owned slaves like Muhammad did.|$|E

He ended AAB and began a new solo project; the year saw the release of a cassette-only single {{entitled}} Room to Breathe on Hanson Records. A follow-up release entitled You Are <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Eat</b> was scrapped when the master recordings went missing. W.K. also recorded the soundtrack for an independent film named Poltergeist made by Aaron Dilloway and himself, one track of which appeared on the Hanson Records compilation Labyrinths & Jokes.

2500|$|The {{supposed}} [...] "story" [...] behind Iron Chef is recounted at {{the beginning}} of every episode. A title card, with a quote from famed French food author Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin first appears: [...] "Tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat,</b> and I'll tell you what you are." [...] Then, it is said that Kaga [...] "realized his dream in a form never seen before" [...] and specially constructed a cooking arena called [...] "Kitchen Stadium" [...] in his castle. There, visiting chefs from [...] "around the world" [...] would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself is a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men's formal attire. The English name Iron Chef comes from the show itself: Kaga would use this translation of the Japanese title when summoning his chefs {{at the beginning}} of the battle.|$|E

6000|$|But {{this is not}} {{the true}} meaning of the term; it should stand for the idea of a {{positive}} and thorough appreciation of the content of anything; for feeling the substance and not merely the surface of experience. [...] "Content" [...] ought to mean in English, as it does in French, being pleased; placidly, perhaps, but still positively pleased. Being contented with bread and cheese ought not to mean not caring <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat.</b> It ought to mean caring for bread and cheese; handling and enjoying the cubic content of the bread and cheese and adding it to your own. Being content with an attic ought not to mean being unable to move from it and resigned to living in it. It ought to mean appreciating what there is to appreciate in such a position; such as the quaint and elvish slope of the ceiling or the sublime aerial view of the opposite chimney-pots. And in this sense contentment is a real and even an active virtue; it is not only affirmative, but creative. The poet in the attic does not forget the attic in poetic musings; he remembers whatever the attic has of poetry; he realises how high, how starry, how cool, how unadorned and simple&mdash;in short, how Attic is the attic.|$|E

Then to-morrow I'll give you just one hour after you've finished your breakfast {{to get out of this}} camp altogether, entirely out of my sight. I tried to have you sent away before, but other people took you up, and so I said no more; but now things are different.

No need to shake your head, for that's not your way; you are no hound to bite the hand that feeds you, like these street-bred dogs. Would that I could keep you nearer to me, where hour by hour you might help me with your counsel and your quiet strength. But it may not be--as yet. I raise you as high as I dare, but it must be done step by step, for even now some grow jealous. Take heed to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>eat,</b> Olaf.
