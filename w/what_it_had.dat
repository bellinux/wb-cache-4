He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there. On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been called unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon {{after taking the}} leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national campaign committee, something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E

There he noticed a huge drydock standing empty, and after querying <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been used for, he learnt that it was where Yamato had been built. Spurr had been isolated in Burma for several years and had never heard of Yamato, but he became interested in her story and started collecting information about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Growth came rapidly {{over the}} next few years as the town saw the {{construction}} of a bank, a public school, a city hall, several sizable industries and a series of amusement parks at present-day Treaty Oak Park. In 1910 Atlantic Boulevard opened between South Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches, further cementing South Jacksonville's place as a hub for car and ferry traffic. By 1917 the town's population was ten times <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been when it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E

5|$|Before {{leaving for}} Italy, Skanderbeg needed to {{accumulate}} the appropriate finances. Pius ordered the Diocese of Dalmatia {{to give a}} third of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> raised for the forthcoming crusade to Skanderbeg. The pope also ordered 1,000 florins {{to be given to}} Skanderbeg from the Vatican's funds. The Ragusan banks held this amount, but due to the threat of an Ottoman invasion, they refused to continue funding the crusade; Stefan Vukčić of Zeta warned that the Ottomans would soon move into Dalmatia and Albania. They were thus reluctant to fund Skanderbeg's expedition to Italy. Due to issues of finance and the lack of large ships (he had, however, received several smaller ships to transport his troops), Skanderbeg's arrival was delayed while Ferdinand was under siege in Barletta. Before the siege began, however, Ferndinand sent four galleys to the Albanian shores where Skanderbeg and his men were waiting. Skanderbeg had meanwhile sent an unnamed captain to his eastern frontiers to guard against an Ottoman attack and left his wife, Donika, in charge of his affairs.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose's {{finances}} {{entered the}} second half of the century in poor shape, and considerably worse than the period between 1930 and 1931, slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th. But they were improved during Last's tenure, along with undergraduate admissions; the college showed a surplus in 1952–53, and income in 1957 (£104,000) was double <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in 1938. Pay for fellows was still poor, and they were small in number compared to other colleges. There was a sizeable entertainment budget, however, something which, combined with the long hours, have contributed to short lifespans. Only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age. Last resigned as Principal in 1956, dying shortly after. Turnover was considerable, although some fellows stayed on: Maurice Platnauer became Principal in 1956, and retired in 1960; he was replaced by Sir Noel Hall. Hall's tenure was troubled, not externally, but rather from Hall's patchy knowledge of the college and staff; his selection, faute de mieux, was sometimes questioned, although he remained well-liked. However, the college, which had thus far stayed assured, found itself in a changing environment. Herbert Hart, however, Principal between 1973 and 1978, was the first to be elected from outside Brasenose. Lord Windlesham, made principal in 1989, was the first to hold Cabinet Office.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties felt she should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{eighteen}} years that Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half; three-quarters of this growth came in the 1960s and early 1970s. During {{the second half of}} Brezhnev's reign, average income per head grew by one-quarter. In {{the first half of the}} Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5% per annum; slightly less growth than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been the previous years. This can be explained by Brezhnev's reversal of most of Khrushchev's policies. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, but with three-quarters of this growth happening before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his rule. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Division was {{assigned}} responsibility for completing {{the destruction of}} the Japanese Eighteenth Army, which was the last large Japanese force remaining in the Australian portion of New Guinea. The division was reinforced by CMF and armoured units and began arriving at Aitape in October 1944. The 6th Division was also supported by several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships. In late 1944 the Australians launched a two-pronged offensive to the east towards Wewak. The 17th Brigade advanced through the inland Torricelli Mountains while the remainder of the division moved along the coast. Although the Eighteenth Army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease, it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties. The 6th Division's advance was also hampered by supply difficulties and bad weather. The Australians secured the coastal area by early May, with Wewak being captured on 10 May after a small force was landed to the east of the town. By {{the end of the war}} the Eighteenth Army had been forced into <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> designated its 'last stand' area which was under attack from the 6th Division. The Aitape-Wewak campaign cost Australia 442 lives while about 9,000Japanese died and another 269 were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} this decline was the club's ongoing {{financial}} problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then {{on the outskirts of}} urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. To stay afloat, Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By {{the end of the decade}} the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris, who was also the chairman of Fulham.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} Transoxiana (Arabic: Ma wara' al-nahr) had been conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in {{the reign of}} al-Walid I (r. 705–715), {{following}} the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid-7th century. The loyalties of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable, however, as demonstrated in 719, when the Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese and their Turgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate's governors. The Turgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana, beginning in 720. These incursions were coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Sogdians. The Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi, harshly suppressed the unrest and restored the Muslim position almost to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been {{during the time of}} Qutayba, except for the Ferghana Valley, control over which was lost.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 14th century, French kings {{sought to}} expand their {{influence}} {{at the expense of}} the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327–77) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376), won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France. The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346.|$|E
