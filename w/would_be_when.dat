Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the figures}} used in the {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

5|$|Proposed {{transportation}} {{management strategies}} {{are aimed at}} keeping traffic into Aspen at the baseline 1993 level through 2015. There are three levels or strategic response: The first <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> that baseline is equaled or slightly exceeded. It would consist of promoting ride sharing and more extensive transit use, among other informational measures. At Level 2, when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level, more transit service would be added, and parking rates raised slightly to fund the additional buses required to reduce headways. Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded the baseline by 5–10%, and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in parking fees, deliberately {{limiting the number of}} spaces available, and making some parts of downtown Aspen car-free zones.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E

[...] He also set the NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 43carries (for 159yards) on November 20, 1983. Woolfolk gained 115yards on 26carries {{in the first half}} alone and said after the game: [...] "I'm not as tired as I thought I <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> somebody told me how many carries I had."

500|$|It was {{revealed}} that cast members filmed {{on a number of}} location settings. One of these included an army barracks. They also filmed scenes at Tatenhill Airfield.

500|$|A {{few months}} later, the Junta of Seville {{appointed}} a new Viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. Some patriots proposed a self-coup to keep Liniers {{in power and}} resist the new viceroy, but Saavedra and Liniers himself did not accept it and the transition was performed without problems. Although Saavedra supported the plans of the criollos to seize power, he warned about taking rushed measures, considering that the ideal time to do so <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> the Napoleonic forces achieved a decisive advantage in the Spanish conflict. Until then, he forced the other revolutionaries to stay quiet by denying {{the help of his}} regiment. His usual quote was [...] "Peasants and gentlemen, it is not yet time – let the figs ripen, and then we'll eat them." [...] Although he was sometimes suspected of sympathy for Cisneros for his reluctance to take action against him, he maintained his strategy. Saavedra's political moderation may have been influenced by his previous career in the Cabildo.|$|E
500|$|... "No Future" [...] {{was nearly}} {{cut from the}} record.

[...] An example of acceptance <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> people feel angry and then choose to focus on the anger and accept that they are angry, rather than trying to unleash their anger to get rid of it. [...] Cognitive defusion teaches people to not take their thoughts as literal in order to decrease the believability of negative thoughts and increase flexibility to behave as they want. [...] An example of cognitive defusion <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> someone thinks “I am the worst,” and then defuses the thought by thinking of things in which he or she excels.|$|E

2500|$|Fischer {{takes the}} short line 12 {{to be the}} {{beginning}} of the text, reasoning {{that it would have been}} easier to indent the first line than to estimate how long the last line <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> fitting it in, and that the large glyphs in line 13 past the end of line 12 were written that way to fill in the gap. However, he does note that there are remnants of pre-inscription tracings that would have enabled such an estimate. Horley (2011) makes a case that 12 was the last line: That the text starts at line 11, wraps around (in descending order) to 13, and that 12 was fit into the gap between the slightly skew lines 11 and 13. The way lines 12 and 13 squeeze together (the glyphs are 12–14mm high at the thick end of the staff, but only 8–10mm high at the end of line 12 where 13 takes over) is consistent with these being the last lines engraved.|$|E
