5|$|The {{attack on}} the Pindaris was carried out as planned. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were {{surrounded}} and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris {{from the south and}} drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army. Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur. The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered {{in the course of a}} single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris. The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed <b>with</b> <b>vigor.</b> All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison. Setu, a Jat by caste, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger.|$|E

25|$|Secretary of the Navy Welles {{was dismayed}} by the failure.

As Rodgers saw it, and as Welles had to agree, Charleston could not be taken by a purely naval assault. It would require a combined operation, with full cooperation of both services, to achieve that.|$|E

Habert's division was left to defend the place while Suchet consolidated his gains. Of the 7,179 defenders, 1,400 were killed or wounded and 3,974 were captured. French losses were about 400.

From there, the Grand Marshal sent inquiries to the Order's allies throughout Europe for aid. On 27 February, the Poles and their allies from the Danzig established a perimeter, complete with siege equipment, artillery, and several thousand troops. To prevent the town from being cut off from communication, the knights made constant sorties and at least once broke {{the lines of the}} besiegers, capturing the guns, supply trains and about 300 prisoners. Despite initial problems, the Poles, who had received orders to follow up on the siege <b>with</b> <b>vigor,</b> continued in their efforts, effectively regrouping outside the city walls, and repulsing the small number of knights who made regular forays against them.|$|E
25|$|After a gap during World War I, {{the club}} was refounded in 1919 as Unione Sportiva Palermo, by a {{committee}} of young university students and sportsmen. During the early 1920s, the club mainly competed in the Campionato Lega Sud, a football league in Southern Italy, reaching the semi-finals in 1924 before being knocked out by Audace Taranto, Alba Roma and Internaples. The club was dissolved in 1927 due to financial problems, but was reformed one year later following a merger <b>with</b> <b>Vigor</b> Palermo under the name Palermo FootBall Club. Originally admitted to Prima Divisione (First Division), the equivalent of today's Serie C1, the team was promoted into Serie B in 1930 and finally reached Serie A in 1932. From its debut season in Italy's top division, Palermo relocated to a new home, the Stadio Littorio (Lictorian Stadium) in the Favorita neighbourhood, today known as Stadio Renzo Barbera. The club played Serie A until 1936, when they were relegated to Serie B and first played Catania in the Sicilian derby.|$|E
25|$|In 1672, however, he {{was forced}} to take action. He entered into an {{alliance}} for the defence of the United Provinces during the Franco-Dutch War; then, after this league had collapsed owing to the defection of the elector of Brandenburg, the more durable Quadruple Alliance was formed for the same purpose, including, besides the emperor, the king of Spain and several German princes, and the war was renewed. At this time, twenty-five years after the Peace of Westphalia, the Empire was virtually a confederation of independent princes, and {{it was very difficult for}} its head to conduct any war <b>with</b> <b>vigor</b> and success, some of its members being in alliance with the enemy and others being only lukewarm in their support of the imperial interests. Thus this struggle, which lasted until the end of 1678, was on the whole unfavourable to Germany, and the advantages of the Treaty of Nijmegen were mostly with France. It can however be argued that the imperial intervention saved the Netherlands from a complete French invasion.|$|E

500|$|Pei took to {{the project}} <b>with</b> <b>vigor,</b> and set to work with two young architects he had {{recently}} recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and Yann Weymouth. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a trapezoid of land {{at the intersection of}} Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: [...] "No compromises." ...|$|E
500|$|Neal Dow (March 20, 1804 – October 2, 1897) was an American Prohibition {{advocate}} and politician. Nicknamed the [...] "Napoleon of Temperance" [...] and the [...] "Father of Prohibition", Dow {{was born to}} a Quaker family in Portland, Maine. From a young age, he believed alcohol to {{be the cause of}} many of society's problems and sought to ban it through legislation. In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union, and the next year he was elected mayor of Portland. Soon after, largely due to Dow's efforts, the state legislature banned the sale and production of alcohol in {{what became known as the}} Maine law. Serving twice as mayor of Portland, Dow enforced the law <b>with</b> <b>vigor</b> and called for increasingly harsh penalties for violators. In 1855, his opponents rioted and he ordered the state militia to fire on the crowd. One man was killed and several wounded, and when public reaction to the violence turned against Dow, he chose not to seek reelection.|$|E

With all my soul I regret this necessity and shrink from it, but you have brought it upon yourself." [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Long called Roosevelt [...] "cowardly" [...] and the article [...] "venomous", but his main criticism stemmed from the President's status as a [...] "gamekiller"; Roosevelt, Long claimed, [...] "has no sympathy with any brand of nature study except his own." [...] While a number of scientists wrote in support of Roosevelt and his position, Long produced several witnesses to prove his claims; to combat one of Roosevelt's specific complaints, Long provided a statement from [...] "a full-blooded Sioux Indian" [...] who declared that wolves {{in the area where}} Wayeeses was said to live were known to attack prey in the chest.

500|$|Reviewer James Berardinelli {{found the}} {{production}} of Doomsday to be a mess, complaining, [...] "The action sequences might be more tense if they weren't obfuscated by rapid-fire editing, and the backstory is muddled and not all that interesting." [...] Berardinelli also believed the attempted development of parallel storylines {{to be too much}} for the film, weakening the eventual payoff. Dennis Harvey of Variety said Neil Marshall's [...] "flair for visceral action" [...] made up for Doomsdays lack of originality and that the film barely had a dull moment. He added, [...] "There's no question that Doomsday does what it does <b>with</b> <b>vigor,</b> high technical prowess and just enough humor to avoid turning ridiculous." [...] Harvey considered the conclusion relatively weak, and found the quality of the acting satisfactory for the genre, while reserving praise for the [...] "stellar" [...] work of the stunt personnel. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised the film's stunts, noting that it was reminiscent of [...] "the beauty of the exploitation film era".

[...] Jim Harrington from San Jose Mercury News felt that the show {{would have been better}} technically if around thirty minutes were lessened from it. James Montogomery from MTV reviewed the concert at San Diego and said that [...] " [...] powered through and turned the San Diego Sports Arena into a raucous, delightfully raw discotheque." [...] Writing for the Las Vegas Sun, Joe Brown observed that [...] "Lady Gaga out-Cher-ed Cher, made Cirque du Soleil and Britney's 'Circus Tour' look like county fair carnivals, and made New Year's Eve in Las Vegas anticlimactic." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers avouched that the tour was [...] "an invigoratingly ambitious show, executed <b>with</b> <b>vigor</b> by its star and her expressive dancers."

500|$|Progress {{was further}} {{complicated}} in early 1963, {{as a group}} in the US Congress called for the Soviet proposal to be discarded {{in favor of the}} Geneva System. On 27 May 1963, 34 US Senators, led by Humphrey and Thomas J.

Absent Soviet agreement, the resolution called for Kennedy to continue to [...] "pursue it <b>with</b> <b>vigor,</b> seeking the widest possible international support" [...] while suspending all atmospheric and underwater tests. The effect of the resolution was to bolster the general push for a test ban, though Kennedy initially was concerned that it would damage attempts to secure a comprehensive ban, and had administration figures (including the Joint Chiefs of Staff) reiterate a call for a comprehensive ban. That same spring of 1963, however, Kennedy had sent antinuclear activist Norman Cousins to Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, where he explained that the political situation in the US made it very difficult for Kennedy agree to a comprehensive ban with Khrushchev's required terms. Cousins also assured Khrushchev that though Kennedy had rejected Khrushchev's offer of three yearly inspections, he still was set on achieving a test ban. In March 1963, Kennedy had also held a press conference in which he re-committed to negotiations with the Soviet Union as a means of preventing rapid nuclear proliferation, which he characterized as [...] "the greatest possible danger and hazard." ...|$|E
