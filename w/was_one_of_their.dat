5|$|On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own {{until he}} desired {{to control the}} yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing {{that the way to}} fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro {{requests}} that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrenes were pagans and worshiped {{a number}} of Semitic gods, with Bel {{at the head of}} their pantheon. Zenobia {{accommodated}} Christians and Jews, and ancient sources made many claims about the queen's beliefs; Manichaeist sources alleged that Zenobia <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own. It is more likely, however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.|$|E

5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This {{was to make sure}} that the portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
5|$|The First French Republic {{had long}} planned an {{invasion}} of the British Isles, but their ambitions had been repeatedly thwarted by other factors, including other fronts of the Revolutionary Wars, the War in the Vendée and the parlous state of the French Navy. This latter problem was a major cause for concern: the Navy had suffered heavily from the removal of its officer corps during the Revolution and then endured a series of military setbacks, culminating in the tactical defeat at the Glorious First of June in 1794 and the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver in 1795. After securing peace on several fronts in 1795, the new French Directory decided that Britain <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> most dangerous remaining opponents, and they determined to defeat it through invasion.|$|E
