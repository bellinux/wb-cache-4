5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it {{quite apart from}} the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony {{with the}} {{perpetual}} cession of Hong Kong Island from the Qing Empire after the First Opium War (1839–1842). The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were the}} religiously diverse {{part of the}} British Empire, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a {{favorite}} destination for that group as well as German Lutherans, German Reformed and numerous small sects such as Mennonites, Amish and Moravians, not to mention Scotch Irish Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed were strong in upstate New York and New Jersey, and Congregationalists were important in Long Island. The First Great Awakening invigorated religiosity and helped stimulate the growth of Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches. Non-British colonists included Dutch Calvinist, Swedish Lutherans, Palatine Mennonites, and the Amish.|$|E

5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of angularity, make {{some types of}} volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E

5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E

5|$|This {{was not an}} {{encouraging}} start for the operation but despite this, the LCS decided {{to continue with the}} deception. Colonel Thornton's trip was approved and he travelled to Stockholm toward the end of April. Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences were treated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of secrecy in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's conversations were recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite siding with the Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, but he kept this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} {{comprehensive test ban}} treaty (CTBT). Following a series of international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT. The technology for detecting underground tests has significantly improved since the 1950s and 1960s, with monitors detecting tests down to 1 kiloton <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of confidence.|$|E
5|$|Wellington faced armies {{formed from}} the disbanded French Grande Armée, once an overpowering force, which having conquered Europe and {{expanded}} the French Empire had been led by Napoleon and his marshals since 1804. It had been reformed into multiple {{smaller and more}} mobile armies from October 1808. In the Peninsula the French were grouped into multiple armies, each operating chiefly in its own area, {{in order to secure}} Portugal and Spain. These forces were commanded by French marshals, senior generals chosen for elevation by Napoleon himself. Though these armies were under the nomiminal command of Napoleon's brother, King Joseph Bonaparte, the marshals commanded their armies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of independence. Wellington arrived in Lisbon in 1809 with an army composed mostly of volunteers. British troops were better trained than their French counterparts and were required to repeatedly practice firing with live rounds before encountering combat. Napoleon only personally campaigned in Spain once, between October 1808 and January 1809, taking most of his Guard and many élite troops with him when he left. After the disastrous failure of the invasion of Russia, Napoleon weakened his forces in Spain in early 1813 by redeploying many veteran troops from the Peninsula to Germany to shore up his losses. Subsequently, many of the remaining troops became a second line in quality, experience and equipment– some new recruits were often not French.|$|E
