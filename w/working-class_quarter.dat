In The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Engels described Salford as [...] "really one large <b>working-class</b> <b>quarter...</b> very unhealthy, dirty and dilapidated district which, while other industries were almost always textile related is situated opposite the 'Old Church' of Manchester".|$|E
2500|$|Circus Sideshow {{is a large}} oil {{painting}} on canvas measuring [...] Painted in the Divisionist style, the work employs pointillist dots of color (primarily violet-gray, blue-gray, orange, and green) and a play of lines governed by rules whose laws Seurat had studied. It depicts immobile figures outdoors under artificial lighting at the sideshow of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, a <b>working-class</b> <b>quarter</b> in eastern Paris. A row of cornet and trombone players in solemn formation are seen under the unreal evening lights of a parade. The work is dominated by a monotony of horizontal and vertical lines, suggesting the rhythms of Egyptian reliefs and frescoes. Though rather than indicating distance as Egyptian art (by changing scale), or classically (by foreshortening), Seurat establishes the position of his subjects through lighting. Those in the foreground are unlit, painted in dark blue, while those behind the gas jets are brilliantly lit.|$|E

Once vast Slavonian oak forests were mostly replaced with farmland, and a section of the <b>working-class</b> <b>quarters</b> of Salamon H. Gutmann from 1884 became part of the present-day Belišće.|$|R
25|$|Concerning social housing, {{there are}} several organisations which are the Public Housing Office of Valence (OPH) and Housing Development of Drôme (DAH) who construct, {{maintain}} and manage social housing throughout the city and in the Valence agglomeration, most are located in so-called <b>working-class</b> <b>quarters.</b> As for the grants of the OPH, {{they come from the}} city of Valence, the Drôme department, the region and the State.

50|$|Indigenous {{organized}} crime based {{in some of}} The Netherlands' major cities, mainly Amsterdam and The Hague, mostly has origins in the traditional <b>working-class</b> <b>quarters.</b> These small groups mainly consist of local career criminals that band together for their involvement in organized criminal activities such as extortion, loan sharking, prostitution and narcotics. Often these local criminals groups are strongly connected with, {{or in some cases}} even have an official membership to, outlaw motorcycle gangs such as the Hells Angels MC.|$|R
60|$|So that a {{universal}} social collapse followed, {{as it were}} a logical consequence, upon world-wide war. Wherever there were great populations, great masses of people found themselves without work, without money, and unable to get food. Famine was in every <b>working-class</b> <b>quarter</b> in the world within three weeks {{of the beginning of}} the war. Within a month there was not a city anywhere in which the ordinary law and social procedure had not been replaced by some form of emergency control, in which firearms and military executions were not being used to keep order and prevent violence. And still in the poorer quarters, and in the populous districts, and even here and there already among those who had been wealthy, famine spread.|$|E
60|$|But her {{sparkling}} eyes {{gave the}} lie to her words. Like {{the rest of}} us, she was enjoying it hugely. Quite an adventure it was, getting those candles. It was not until we went across the city and down into the <b>working-class</b> <b>quarter</b> south of Market Street that we found small corner groceries {{that had not yet}} sold out. Miss Chickering thought one box was sufficient, but I persuaded her into taking four. My car was large, and I laid in a dozen boxes. There was no telling what delays might arise in the settlement of the strike. Also, I filled the car with sacks of flour, baking-powder, tinned goods, and all the ordinary necessaries of life suggested by Harmmed, who fussed around and clucked over the purchases like an anxious old hen.|$|E

40|$|Workers’ Housing in Modern Milan: Giovanni Broglio and the Società Umanitaria in the First Decade of the 20 th Century Ornella Selvafolta Few architects in Milan {{have linked}} {{their names and}} their {{achievement}} to working-class housing as closely as Giovanni Broglio, ranging from the workers' housing built for the Società Umanitaria in Via Solari (1906) and Viale Lombardia (1909), to {{the direction of the}} technical department of the Istituto Autonomo Case Popolari di Milano (IACPM). From 1913 to 1934, Broglio designed or, at least, supervised the design of most of the housing quarters built {{in the early decades of}} the twentieth century. To his credit he had almost “ 100, 000 home units”, as was written in an article published in 1956 on the occasion of his death, pointing out the 40 housing estates built during his twenty years direction of the IACPM: estates that have marked whole parts of the city and determined the way of life of entire generations. Among them, the two <b>working-class</b> <b>quarters</b> designed and built for the Società Umanitaria were intended as examples for the city of Milan, other institutions and society at large, showing new practical and efficient ways to improve low-cost housing. Broglio and the Società Umanitaria were guided by the powerful idea that environmental quality affects behaviour and that homes not only satisfy basic needs but also are essential tools for improving culture and education. The innovative features of the neighbourhood in Via Solari were such as to constitute an important signal to modern Milan; in 1906 it was presented with a certain emphasis at the Esposizione Internazionale del Sempione, which celebrated the opening of the railway tunnel between France and Italy. The event gave international audience to the Società Umanitaria and to Broglio’s realizations, that since then began to be studied and also imitated. Both the quarters of Via Solari and Viale Lombardia introduced a more careful study of the space plan and organization, showed a new attention to hygienic devices, and, above all, featured a wide range of modern facilities and social services that brought real improvements to working-classes ways of life, providing valuable models for subsequent research and activities in the field until after World War 1...|$|R
50|$|Ruzafa, {{one of the}} old {{parts of}} the city, is located behind the North Station (Estación del Norte, Estació del Nord), and is {{particularly}} famous for being a meeting place for the most modern bohemian people. Many of the old houses and palaces have been rebuilt and adapted as bars or pubs, restaurants. Many of this music bars and pubs have the attraction of including live music performances (rock, jazz, blues...). Ruzafa has overtaken Carmen as the city's hippest area. It is a <b>working-class,</b> ethnically diverse <b>quarter</b> that is being colonised by young creatives - Valencia's version of Brixton and Candem in London. It is full of vintage clothes shops, bike shops, homeware stores which sells work by contemporary Valencian artist, art gallery/wine shop. Restaurants range from traditional tapas and bocadillos to oysters, South American restaurants, and fusion. The park on Plaza Manuel Granero is a green space in Ruzafa, where kids play in a Wendy house, on swings and slides, or kick a football around, while adults beef up their muscles on the machines in the open-air gym or take a beer in the dappled sunlight outside Bar el Parque.Valencia has a bit over 800,000 inhabitants, of which some 25,000 live in Russafa. Ruzafa district in its closest area to Reino de Valencia avenue, and offers many advantages: it is very centric, very easy to locate, it has a comfortable and very quick access to the old river Turia gardens and it has all kind of services, not only shops, bars and restaurants, but also schools, banks, medical centres, etc. An extra advantage is being so close to the Mercado de Ruzafa, specially for those fresh food lovers. The “mercat de Russafa” (Ruzafa's market) is more than a market. It is the center of the economical and cultural life of this neighborhood.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Urban Occupations Urbaines: Curating the Post-industrial Landscape Shauna Janssen, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2014 This {{thesis is}} a socio-historical and spatial study of Griffintown, Montreal. I use Griffintown, a rapidly gentrifying {{neighbourhood}} {{and one of}} Montreal’s formerly <b>working-class</b> and industrial <b>quarters,</b> {{as a case study}} for critiquing the ethics and politics of urban revitalization projects, and affirming the critical and creative role that indeterminacy and interstitial spaces play in the cultural life of post-industrial landscapes. In 2010, I initiated Urban Occupations Urbaines, a curatorial project and invited artists to critically and creatively engage with Griffintown’s spatial history and imminent transformation. Over the course of one year, Urban Occupations Urbaines became a catalyst for assembling diverse forms agency, as well as uncovering less visible and known forms of agency that have occupied and contributed to the culture of Griffintown’s then post-industrial landscape. In this thesis, I situate curatorial practice as a critical methodology for engaging particular communities, artists, and the public in a broader cultural discourse concerning the spatial politics of urban revitalization. I illuminate how site-specific art projects have the capacity to mobilize community activism, modes of participation, spatial interventions, the public role of artists, and engender collaborative forms of knowledge production. I identify what latent agencies are made visible and intelligible through the process of curating site-specific art projects in a post-industrial landscape, and under what urban conditions ideas about community, place, creativity, and public space are being reimagined. An interdisciplinary project, the thesis builds on critical discourses addressing the politics of curating site-specific, collaborative, participatory and socially-engaged art practices in relation to theories of the city, space, place, performance studies, posthumanist thought, and feminist epistemology. The goals of this dissertation are to broaden the discourse of interdisciplinary research, make an original contribution in its methodology and, more specifically, bring together a spatial, cultural and social analysis of urban revitalization politics through politically and socially-engaged site-specific art practices. In this aim, I foreground curatorial practice as a method for this kind of research, the many forms that site-specific art projects take, and show how, as social and spatial practices, they carry their own forms of critical urban discourse and cultural pedagogy...|$|R
