5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the <b>wandering</b> <b>albatross,</b> per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the <b>wandering</b> <b>albatross),</b> although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E
5|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that albatrosses were predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents, predators, or death. The deployment of capillary depth recorders, which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird, has shown that while some species, like the <b>wandering</b> <b>albatross,</b> do not dive deeper than a metre, some species, like the light-mantled albatross, have a mean diving depth of almost 5m and can dive as deep as 12.5m. In addition to surface feeding and diving, they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the <b>wandering</b> <b>albatross,</b> which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the <b>wandering</b> <b>albatross),</b> scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 547 {{sightings}} of 291 banded <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> Diomedea exulans and 21 sightings of 14 banded giant petrels Macronectes spp. {{were made from}} toothfish longliners operating on the southern Patagonian Shelf during 2001 – 2005. This included 25 % of the <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> with Darvic bands that bred at Bird Island (South Georgia) during this period. Thirteen of the northern Macronectes halli and southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus had been banded at South Georgia, {{and there was one}} sighting of a southern giant petrel from Argentina.

40|$|International audienceThe highly mobile <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> (Diomedea exulans) are {{adapted to}} {{navigate}} the extreme environment of the Southern Ocean and return to isolated islands to breed. Each year they cover several {{hundreds of thousands of}} kilometers during travels across the sea. Little is known about the dispersal flights and migration of young albatrosses. We tracked, by satellite telemetry, the departure dispersal of 13 juvenile <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> from the Crozet Islands and compared them with tracks of 7 unrelated adults during the interbreeding season. We used the satellite tracks to identify different behavioural steps of the inherited migration program used by juvenile <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> during their first solo-migration. Our results show that the juvenile <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> from Crozet Islands moved to sex-specific foraging zones of the ocean using at departures selectively the wind. The results suggest that the inherited migration program used by the juvenile <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> encode several distinct steps, based on inherited preferred departure routes, differences in migration distance between sexes, and selective use of winds. During long transportation flights the albatrosses were influenced by winds and both adult and juveniles followed approximate loxodrome (rhumbline) routes coinciding with the foraging zone and the specific latitudes of their destination areas. During the long segments of transportation flights across open seas the juveniles selected routes at more northerly latitudes than adults...|$|R

25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between predator sizes and prey sizes {{is well documented}} for terrestrial but rarely for marine ecosystems. We show that <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses,</b> the biggest albatross species, feed on larger cephalopod prey than those consumed by smaller albatrosses (grey-headed and black-browed albatrosses). This reflects differences in timing of breeding, foraging ecology and their feeding methods. <b>Wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> breed later in the year, during the austral winter, than smaller albatrosses (therefore catching older squid) and forage {{most of the year}} in Antarctic open waters, sub-Antarctic, subtropical and tropical waters, overlapping minimally with the smaller albatrosses' foraging range while breeding. Also, <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> mostly scavenge whereas smaller albatrosses feed more on live prey. Prey ecology may also play a key role because many squid species might experience post-spawning mortality during the austral winter, becoming easily available to <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses.</b> Spawning in winter can be linked to predator avoidance (i. e. reduction in mortality in winter by avoiding pelagic predators) and would allow squid larvae to develop and take advantage of the high productivity (i. e. Antarctic phytoplankton bloom) in spring and at the beginning of summer. Thus, aspects of prey and predator ecology may combine to generate observed differences in prey size...|$|R

40|$|Animals are {{primarily}} limited by {{their capacity to}} acquire food, yet digestive performance also conditions energy acquisition, and ultimately fitness. Optimal foraging theory predicts that organisms feeding on patchy resources should maximize their food loads within each patch, and should digest these loads quickly to minimize travelling costs between food patches. We tested the prediction of high digestive performance in <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses,</b> which can ingest prey of up to 3 kg, and feed on highly dispersed food resources across the southern ocean. GPS-tracking of 40 <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> from the Crozet archipelago during the incubation phase confirmed foraging movements of between 475 - 4705 km, which give birds access {{to a variety of}} prey, including fishery wastes. Moreover, using miniaturized, autonomous data recorders placed in the stomach of three birds, we performed the first-ever measurements of gastric pH and temperature in procellariformes. These revealed surprisingly low pH levels (average 1. 50 ± 0. 13), markedly lower than in other seabirds, and comparable to those of vultures feeding on carrion. Such low stomach pH gives <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> a strategic advantage since it allows them a rapid chemical breakdown of ingested food and therefore a rapid digestion. This is useful for feeding on patchy, natural prey, but also on fishery wastes, which might be an important additional food resource for <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlbatrosses {{are known}} for their extreme {{navigation}} performance enabling them to locate isolated breeding islands after long-distance migrations across open seas. Little is known about the migration of young albatrosses and how they reach the adults' navigation and foraging skills during the period of immaturity lasting several years and spent permanently flying across the open ocean. We tracked by satellite telemetry the dispersal and migration of 13 juvenile <b>wandering</b> <b>albatrosses</b> from the Crozet Islands during their first year at sea. The young albatrosses covered an average distance of 184, 000 km during the first year, restricting their dispersal movement to the unproductive and low wind subtropical Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea.
