2500|$|In 2008, a {{longitudinal}} study conducted in Japan assessed possible long-term effects of video game playing in children. The final analysis consisted of 591 fifth graders aged 10–11 across eight public elementary schools, and was conducted {{over the course of}} a year. [...] Initially, children <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a survey which assessed presence or absence of violence in the children's favorite video games, as well as video game context variables that may affect the results and the aggression levels of the children. [...] Children were assessed again for these variables a year later. [...] Results reveal that there is a significant difference in gender, with boys showing significantly more aggressive behavior and anger than girls, which was attributed by the authors to boys elevated interest in violent video games. [...] However the interaction between time spent gaming and preference for violent games was associated with reduced aggression in boys but not girls. [...] The researchers also found that eight context variables they assessed increased aggression, including unjustified violence, availability of weapons, and rewards. Three context variables, role-playing, extent of violence, and humor, were associated with decreased aggression. [...] It is unknown if the observed changes from the two surveys are actually contextual effects. [...] The researchers found that the context and quality of the violence in video games affects children more than simply presence and amount of violence, and these effects are different from child to child.|$|E

All test-retest correlations were extremely high with values above 0.93 which was the lowest value for the correlation between heterosexual identity in the test and pretest. This strongly indicates the reliability of the Sell Assessment.|$|E

The results showed that for most attitudes the touristic experience did not change the attitudes and opinions of Israelis towards Egypt and the Egyptian people.
