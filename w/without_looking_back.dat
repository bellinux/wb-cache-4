25|$|In the Argonautica, a 3rd-century BCE Alexandrian epic {{based on}} early material, Jason placates Hecate in a ritual {{prescribed}} by Medea, her priestess: bathed at midnight {{in a stream}} of flowing water, and dressed in dark robes, Jason is to dig a round pit and over it cut the throat of an ewe, sacrificing it and then burning it whole on a pyre next to the pit as a holocaust. He is told to sweeten the offering with a libation of honey, then to retreat from the site <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back,</b> even if he hears the sound of footsteps or barking dogs. All these elements betoken the rites owed to a chthonic deity.|$|E
25|$|According to the texts, a {{merchant}} 500 yearsa ago named Manga Oswal from Nagarparkar {{had gone to}} Pattan to purchase some items. He was informed in a dream that an image was buried under {{the house of a}} local Muslim that Oswal was instructed to acquire. Oswal bought the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka), and was instructed in another dream to place the image on a cart and to move forward <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back.</b> The cart is said to have broken down near Nagarparkar, where Oswal then fell asleep. In his next dream, he was informed that underneath him lay marble and treasure, and instructed him to recruit craftsmen to build a fine temple in which to worship the idol, which was bestowed with the name Gori. The temple's construction was supervised by an architect from Sirohi, while the shikhar of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The image was formally reconsecrated by Acharya Merutunga Suri of Anchala Gachchha, thus establishing the Gori Parshvanth Tirth, and the temple as a place of pilgrimage for Jains from afar.|$|E

2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back,</b> {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though they}} lost the Second Test the {{reputation}} of the MCC rose again as they fought Australia to a thrilling 28 run finish. They returned to Sydney and played their second game against the strong New South Wales team in preparation for the Third Test. For the third time in a row the New South Wales captain Arthur Morris won the toss and batted on the flat Sydney wicket. On the two previous occasions his team amassed 509/3 and 526/9, but this time they were bowled out for 333 despite a third century from Morris (105), who hit two sixes and 9 fours regardless of his poor form as Bedser's Bunny in the Tests. Keith Miller hit 3 sixes and 7 fours in his 98, but [...] "puzzled the crowd by frequent periods when he would not be tempted into hitting anything, while on other occasions he burst out into hitting spells". Doug Wright (3/98) removed both these giants in his own inimitable way and John Warr (4/74) cleaned up the tail with only Jim de Courcy making any headway with 72 not out. In response Ray Lindwall (1/76) and Alan Walker (1/98) removed Cyril Washbrook and David Sheppard and the MCC were 17/2, but this brought together Len Hutton and Reg Simpson. Hutton, usually so defensive, began to cream the spinners through the covers, making 150 of the first 253 runs in little over three hours when he tired of the sport, walked down the pitch to the pavilion and was stumped off Fred Johnston (2/166) <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back.</b> Simpson continued the bat for over nine hours compiling his highest ever first-class score of 259, adding 236 runs with Hutton and 228 with Gilbert Parkhouse (92). Leg-spinner Reg Madden (3/93) removed Parkhouse, Brown (0) and Evans (2) and when Simpson fell to the part-time off-spin of Jim Burke (1/32) the innings was declared at 553/5, 220 runs ahead. There was little time to finish the match, but New South Wales collapsed 31/5 to Warr (2/25) and Brown (3/24). Burke (40) and Jack Moroney (51 not out) added 90 runs for the sixth wicket and saved the day, stumps being drawn at 130/6. For the first time on the tour the English batsmen had held clear dominance over the Australians and it boded well for the upcoming Test.|$|E
