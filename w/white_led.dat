50|$|There {{are several}} types of multi-color white LEDs: di-, tri-, and tetrachromatic <b>white</b> <b>LEDs.</b> Several key factors that play among these {{different}} methods include color stability, color rendering capability, and luminous efficacy. Often, higher efficiency means lower color rendering, presenting a trade-off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering. For example, the dichromatic <b>white</b> <b>LEDs</b> have the best luminous efficacy (120 lm/W), but the lowest color rendering capability. However, although tetrachromatic <b>white</b> <b>LEDs</b> have excellent color rendering capability, they often have poor luminous efficacy. Trichromatic <b>white</b> <b>LEDs</b> are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (>70 lm/W) and fair color rendering capability.|$|R

The Fourth Army was tasked with clearing these positions. On 18 September, the Battle of Épehy was fought. The division attacked at 05:40 with the 113th and 114th Brigades. For his role during the assault, William Allison White earned the VC. Alone, he assaulted a machine gun post that was hindering the advance, killing the defenders and capturing the gun. He then launched a second attack, accompanied by two others who were killed, to seize another German machine gun position killing a further five and again capturing the gun. In a third action, <b>White</b> <b>led</b> a small group to overwhelm a German defensive position that was also holding up the advance. He proceeded to organise the defence of the position, and fought off a German counterattack with heavy losses using captured machine guns. Both brigades were able to reach their objectives despite flanking fire, and fought off numerous counter-attacks. Despite this, the Germans were able to cling on to Gouzeaucourt.

25|$|Incandescent bulbs {{are much}} less {{efficient}} than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150lm/W for some <b>white</b> <b>LED</b> lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb (such as heat lamps) deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared {{with other types of}} lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.|$|E
