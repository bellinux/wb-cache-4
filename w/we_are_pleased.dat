Standard Oil (later Esso) was also a sponsor, owing to the efforts of James [...] "Billboard" [...] Jackson, a pioneering African-American Esso sales representative. Esso's [...] "race group", part of its marketing division, promoted the Green Book as enabling Esso's black customers to [...] "go further with less anxiety".
