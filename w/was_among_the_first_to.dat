5|$|Critic Vivian Mercier <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{recognise}} Samuel Beckett's debt to Synge. Beckett was {{a regular}} member of the audience at the Abbey in his youth and particularly admired the plays of Yeats, Synge and O'Casey. Mercier points out parallels between Synge's casts of tramps, beggars and peasants {{and many of the}} figures in Beckett's novels and dramatic works.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{be studied}} {{over a long}} term by the Chinese government. More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending {{as much as a}} year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.|$|E
5|$|The unit <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{occupy the}} {{territory}} of a Confederate state when it captured Alexandria, Virginia on May 24, 1861, less than 24hours after the Commonwealth seceded from the Union. The regiment suffered extensive casualties during the First Battle of Bull Run during the fighting on Henry House Hill and while serving as the rear guard for the retreating Union Army.|$|E
5|$|Young's wife, Roba, whom he {{had known}} since childhood, died in 1933. After she died, Young tried several jobs, and {{eventually}} moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them. Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement. In 1937, 26 years after he retired from baseball, Young {{was inducted into the}} Baseball Hall of Fame. He <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> donate mementos to the Hall.|$|E

5|$|Fermi <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> warn {{military}} leaders {{about the potential}} impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher's {{efforts to}} match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas {{previously}} neglected by the NHL. The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of US college players, including Joel Otto, Gary Suter, and Colin Patterson. Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring Hakan Loob and other key players. He <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> draft players from the Soviet Union, including HC CSKA Moscow star Sergei Makarov in 1983, but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989. Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their 1984 Stanley Cup Championship.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993 provincial election, Stelmach {{was elected}} as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vegreville-Viking (later Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville). A Progressive Conservative, {{he served in}} the {{cabinets}} of Ralph Klein—at various times holding the portfolios of Intergovernmental Relations, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development—where he developed a reputation as a low-key politician who avoided the limelight. When Klein resigned the party's leadership in 2006, Stelmach <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> present his candidature to replace him. After a third-place finish on the first ballot of the leadership race, he won an upset second ballot victory over former provincial treasurer Jim Dinning.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document. It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the document {{was transferred to the}} Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the document was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State's campus <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{serve as}} a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and {{is the site of}} what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably Verbascum blattaria (moth mullein), after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off the New England coast.|$|E

5|$|Robert rewarded Ranulf for {{his advice}} during the {{invasion}} by entrusting {{him with the}} administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from political life. Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the middle}} {{or the end}} of the 1700s, much of the Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} was on the frontier. During this time, there were many forts, such as Fort Titzell in the watershed. In 1769, the northern side of Buffalo Creek was surveyed. In the same year, the area {{in the vicinity of the}} creek was opened to settlers. John Sierer <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> arrive, settling on the creek in 1769. The prominent Revolutionary War veteran Colonel John Kelly built an estate on the northern bank of Buffalo Creek. In 1780, there was an Indian attack near the mouth of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{invented the}} single and double wing formations, the three-point stance, {{and the modern}} body block technique. He {{introduced}} several plays, such as the trap run, the bootleg, the naked reverse, and the screen pass. He <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> use the huddle, to number plays, and to teach the spiral pass and spiral punt. He improved shoulder and thigh pads; {{and was the first}} to utilize adjustable fiber, rather than cotton. He also had his own helmet color-coding: red for backs and white for ends.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, Japan {{was one of}} the world's {{two largest}} {{producers}} of motion pictures, along with the United States. Though the country's film industry <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> produce both sound and talking features, the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, Reimai (Dawn), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: Taii no musume (The Captain's Daughter) and Furusato (Hometown), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. Two of the country's leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujirō Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. As late as 1938, over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Pat O'Connor, a {{champion}} amateur wrestler who had competed at the Pan American and the British Empire Games, {{was discovered by}} visiting American wrestlers Joe Pazandak and Butch Levy and taken back to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he eventually became a major star in the National Wrestling Alliance and the American Wrestling Association. On 9 January 1959, O'Connor defeated Dick Hutton in St. Louis, Missouri {{to become the first}} wrestler from New Zealand to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Over the next 20 years, many other wrestlers from New Zealand became big name stars in the United States. Abe Jacobs <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> follow O'Connor to the US and later challenged him for the NWA World title in New York. This was the first time two New Zealanders fought for a world heavyweight championship, and on foreign soil.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as {{executive producer of}} Napoleon Dynamite. Anderson said he intended to select interviewees {{with a variety of}} perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E
