Pavesi {{went on to}} win the stage by close to six minutes over the second-place finisher Luigi Ganna. The race's tenth and final stage was marred by rain. Race leader Carlo Galetti crashed into a hay wagon early on in the stage and sustained some heavy wounds, he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on his bike and finish the stage in fifth place. Despite the rain in Milan, many spectators still came to watch the riders arrive.

Carlo Galetti won the Giro d'Italia by a margin of eighteen points over Pavesi. Galetti and his team, Atala-Continental, won the team classification.|$|E

25|$|The sixth {{match of}} the night and Raw's main event was Randy Orton {{defending}} the WWE Championship against Chris Jericho. Jericho controlled the match by beating Orton and performing many moves. Jericho would then knock Orton onto the outside with a clothesline, which made Orton lay in front of SmackDown's announcer's table. Jericho would then launch into Orton, but Orton would move, which made Jericho run into JBL. Then Jericho and Orton <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the ring. Jericho would then apply the Walls of Jericho on Orton. He tried to reach the ropes but he failed to do so. JBL then interfered and then kicked Jericho, which disqualified Orton. A title cannot change hands by disqualification, therefore Orton retained the WWE Championship.|$|E

Despite getting three poles, he only scored two Top 5's, missed the Daytona 500, and was plagued with 12 DNFs, causing him to finish 29th in points. He also won the exhibition No-Bull Sprint, which put him into the Winston at Lowe's Motor Speedway. He also ran half the schedule in the Busch Series, winning two {{of the first three}} races of the season with Buckshot Racing, before ending the season driving for Fitz Motorsports.

25|$|In 2004, Bhutan {{became the}} first country to {{completely}} outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco products. Penalties for violating the ban increased under the 'Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010'. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted {{as long as the}} possessor can prove that they have paid import duties. In January 2016, Turkmenistan president Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov reportedly banned all tobacco sales in the country. The Pitcairn Islands had previously banned the sale of cigarettes; however, it now permits sales from a government-run store. The Pacific island of Niue hopes to become the next country to prohibit the sale of tobacco. A proposal in Iceland would ban tobacco sales from shops, making it prescription-only and therefore dispensable only in pharmacies on doctor's orders. New Zealand hopes to achieve being tobacco-free by 2025 and Finland by 2040. In 2012, anti-smoking groups proposed a 'smoking licence' – if a smoker managed to quit and hand back their licence, they <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> any money they paid for it. Medical students in Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start {{at the rear of}} the field due to unapproved body modifications, but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an {{untimely}} caution while Harvick was on pit road, because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. He never got back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick's third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to go. Next week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken trackbar and would have to go to the garage but he was already locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings, and would be in a must win situation to make the round of 8, but that was no problem for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth, until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami.|$|E

Norris convinced them to stay by persuading them {{that the only way}} they <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to safety was to stay with the team. They cautiously searched the river shore for two more hours without success and reluctantly returned to their forward operating base to rest and hope they would be more successful the next night.

Smart was only used {{for some of}} [...] Erikson's parts, as {{he was the only}} bandmember still in Wisconsin. The working process was also different; while {{the previous}} records had the band gathering for an entire year at Smart Studios, the band would instead work two weeks per month in Los Angeles, with Erikson and Marker flying in from Wisconsin and Colorado, respectively, then spend another two weeks in their home studios while e-mailing ideas back and forth to develop songs.

One day, Swift's friend informed Swift that her high school boyfriend would soon wed.

[...] Swift's friend found this to be humorous, laughing at the idea.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Nina's mother, Trixie (Wendy Stapleton), {{arrived in}} Erinsborough after Nina's father, Nick, ended their relationship. Nina was upset {{to learn about}} her parents split and went into denial. She {{believed}} that they <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together. Trixie was a professional singer and, during a set at Lou's Place, started to lose confidence, so Nina helped her out and saved the night. Stapleton stated that Nina and Trixie's relationship was complicated, and there were issues between them. Nina saw Trixie as an embarrassment, but she helped her out because she saw how sad her mother was. Stapleton explained more about Nina's early life saying, [...] "Nina's life has been almost a gypsy one – living out of a suitcase while her parents toured. She's learned to be independent from an early age, though Trixie idolises her." [...] Nina retreated into books and her imagination instead of being worldly from the travelling she has done. Stapleton and Goodrem {{did not get a}} chance to explore their respective character's relationship much further, as Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma three weeks into the storyline. Scripts were changed so Nina was not directly involved and she was only mentioned by other characters.|$|E

In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, [...] "Take It Easy" [...] and [...] "Hotel California."

He alleged that the director had loved the script and said that he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Dwivedi in a few weeks time. Dwivedi claimed that Bhansali never reverted and was unreachable for Dwivedi. Salman Khan, a close associate of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, in an award ceremony Super Idols, for felicitating specially abled people, by television channel IBN-7, took potshots at Guzaarish, hinting at its poor box office collection and said that [...] "Recently a movie released, Guzaarish, oops sorry! and I made a movie on HIV/ AIDS, not even a dog came to watch the movie."

[...] Her father tried to persuade him to reconsider after assessing Regine's desperate condition, claiming that [...] "It will be the death of her; she is in total despair" [...] Kierkegaard returned the next day and spoke with Regine. To her query as to whether he would ever marry, Kierkegaard icily responded: [...] "Well, yes, in ten years, when I have begun to simmer down and I need a lusty young miss to rejuvenate me." [...] In reality, Kierkegaard had no such plans, and would remain a celibate bachelor for the rest of his life.|$|E
