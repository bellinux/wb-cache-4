5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and is barely visible today. It consisted of a central two pillared room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E
5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of shrub that grows in southwest Western Australia. An attractive plant <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7ft) high, but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E

Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{clothing}} in Parthian inspired sculptures {{have been found}} in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (qamis), combined with trousers and made <b>with</b> <b>fine,</b> ornamented materials. The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court. The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins. The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in Palmyra, Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.|$|E

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are purple-brown to brown. Viewed with a microscopic, the spores appear purple, angular with lobes, and warted, <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> spines {{measuring}} 0.5–1.5µm long; the overall {{dimensions of the}} elliptic spores are 8–12 by 7–9µm. They contain one or two oil drops. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 70–100 by 9–12µm, and have sterigmata that are 2–4µm thick by 7–12µm long. The flesh stains deep blue when a drop of potassium hydroxide solution is applied. The fungus contains the pigment thelephoric acid.|$|E
5|$|The core of {{the pyramid}} is made of roughly hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main pyramid.

5|$|The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 {{were painted}} {{in a special}} version of the {{standard}} crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> red lines. Serif lettering and numerals in gold leaf and vermillion shading were applied. Handrails and sundry small external fittings were chrome-plated, as were the nameplates, which had a black background.|$|E
5|$|The spores are thin-walled, {{elliptical}} with narrowed ends, {{and covered}} <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> warts; they have dimensions of 10–22 by 8–10μm. Both the spores and the asci (spore-bearing cells) are nonamyloid. The asci are narrow and typically 275–300μm long. The paraphyses (sterile cells interspersed among the asci in the hymenium) are slender threadlike. Ultrastructural {{studies have demonstrated}} that the development of the spore wall in G.rufa is similar to the genus Discina (in the Helvellaceae family) and to the other Sarcosomataceae, especially Plectania nannfeldtii; both of these species have fine secondary wall spore ornaments.|$|E
5|$|This was but {{one point}} of {{difference}} between Oak Ridge residents {{and the rest of}} Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and many had college degrees, the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years. Oak Ridge residents demanded, and Groves insisted on, schools <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> teachers and first-rate facilities. To achieve this, the Manhattan District paid teachers nearly twice as much as Anderson County. The consequent drain of qualified teachers from surrounding areas aroused considerable resentment.|$|E

5|$|Tourism has {{now become}} the town's main industry. Initially {{attracted}} by its associations with the Skagen Painters, well-to-do visitors sought to benefit from its special light, colour and its fishermen. Their interest led to new hotels, summer houses and expensive villas. The old fishing village {{was transformed into a}} miniature city <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> streets lined with boutiques. From the 1960s, it became increasingly fashionable for the upper-classes to spend their summers in Skagen.|$|E
5|$|Variety frustosus is morphologically {{similar to}} the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out into small areas by cracks and crevices) in maturity. Its spores are {{slightly}} smaller too, measuring 11–15 by 4–5.5µm. In the European form ereticulatus, the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> reddish granules, while the variety ruforubraporus has pinkish-red pores.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E

5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> reticulations on its upper half.|$|E
5|$|Council House is {{constructed}} from concrete-encased steel frame, with lifts and service rooms located at its eastern end and a fire escape stairwell at its western end. Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber, which features wood panelling {{and has been}} restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment (by contrast {{to most of the}} other levels of the building). The building is almost completely clad with glass, which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the {{undrained}} liquefaction behaviour of sand with finds is more complicated than clean sand, and their interpretation under Critical State Soil Mechanics (CSSM) is a challenge. It is also reported that void ratio is not a good state variable for sand <b>with</b> <b>fines.</b> The inactive contribution of fines to sand microstructure is responsible for the anomaly. To resolve this problem, it is proposed to use equivalent granular void ratio instead of void ratio. It is found that a unique Steady State Line (SSL) called equivalent granular SSL can be achieved for sand <b>with</b> <b>fines</b> by using of the equivalent granular void ratio. This equivalent granular SSL was used as the reference line to calculate state parameters.
