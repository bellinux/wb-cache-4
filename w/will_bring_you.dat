Having spent the intervening years dissecting any scripts {{he could get his}} hands on, and comparing them to the television output, Roddenberry advised the head of the studio's story department that he could write scripts as good as the ones they were using. He submitted his first script on October 22, 1953, under his pseudonym [...] "Robert Wesley". It went into production as episode 9b, [...] "Defense Plant Gambling". On December 1, he made a further request to the LAPD for a second job as a free-lance writer and adviser. This time it was approved.
