40|$|Whilst the {{emphasis}} of European Union rail legislation to date has been on freight, measures such as separation of infrastructure from operations, infrastructure charging regimes and regulation have major implications for the passenger sector. But implementation of these measures in many countries has been inadequate. Crucial to overcoming these problems is the establishment of strong independent regulators in all member states. There is currently no requirement for competition in the passenger sector except for international services, but there is experience both of open access for commercial services and of competitive franchising. However, even where permitted open access competition has been very limited and {{there is evidence that}} undesirable cream skimming may be a problem. Experience of franchising has generally been positive, but in some cases it has failed to drive down costs.

40|$|Globalisation is more an {{opportunity}} than a menace and the European social model is not doomed. Globalisation {{is not a}} zero-sum game but there are undeniably adverse consequences. As a phenomenon of the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries, {{there can be little}} doubt that globalisation is something that resonates widely. But it is not easy to pin down conceptually or empirically. In fact, many of the fears surrounding globalisation are greatly exaggerated and even <b>where</b> <b>justified</b> tend to rest on an incomplete analysis of the process. It follows that to view globalisation as an inexorable and threatening force is simply unwarranted. The policy challenges of globalisation can be grouped under three main headings: equipping the economy to compete in the globalising age; smoothing adjustment; and improving socio-economic governance. Globalisation will increase uncertainties but policy measures should favour the capacity to adjust. Finally, globalisation is not the only rationale for reinventing the welfare state and the challenge for policy-makers is to respond to new paradigms and associated risks by reconfiguring it in ways consistent with the values espoused by the European social model...|$|E

40|$|In the ODELIA {{study for}} the European Commission an {{assessment}} of the outdoor equipment noise directive 2000 / 14 /EC and its amendment 2005 / 88 /EC has been performed.

40|$|In England, {{the problem}} of {{excessive}} delay in court proceedings about children is long-standing, {{and there have been}} numerous initiatives over the years to tackle it. Under the Children and Families Act 2014 there is now a statutory limit of 26 weeks for care proceedings (with provision for longer <b>where</b> <b>justified).</b> If this is to be achieved, the quality of the work that local authorities undertake with children and families before proceedings are started will be more important than ever, and the courts will have to take due account of it. This paper draws on research into the formal ‘pre-proceedings process’ in England and Wales, to assess the prospects for the new approach. The research was undertaken in 2010 - 12, and involved a file survey, observation of pre-proceedings meetings, interviews with key participants (including social workers, lawyers and parents) and a group discussion with judges. The paper considers the implications of the new approach for relationships between the courts and local authorities, in particular how pre-proceedings work should be conducted. The danger is that pre-court practice may become less about family support, more about evidence and timescales, less about prevention of proceedings and more about preparation for court...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Permanent grasslands – {{according}} to the Water Framework Directive – are typical water related ecosystems so they largely affect water quality, its cycling and balance and therefore deserve protection. They are an element of landscape structure (ecosystem function or service) commonly considered a factor stabilising environmental changes. Most threats posed to waters in Poland originate from present cropland structure with its definite predominance of arable lands over grasslands. Agriculture should therefore focus on the improvement of land use structure in order to minimise environmental hazards and to guarantee {{at the same time}} optimum economic effects. This could be achieved by turning arable lands into grasslands (<b>where</b> <b>justified</b> e. g. on light soils) or at least by maintaining present grassland area (condition in negotiations with the EU) and management that would consider environmental protection. Increasing the contribution of grasslands to cropland structure or at least maintaining their pre-sent status quo would help to achieve compromise between the goals of farmers and environmental protection. Purposeful utilisation of ecosystem services, particularly those of grasslands, allows to maintain more intensive farming without environmental hazard. Limited should be only such activi-ties whose intensity exceeds regenerative or buffering environmental capacity e. g. on grounds par-ticularly subjected to water pollution or those included into Natura 2000 network.
