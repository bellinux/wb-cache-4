5|$|After 13 and the {{subsequent}} tours in 1999–2000, band members pursued other projects. Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to Gorillaz, the animated band he had created with Jamie Hewlett. Alex James worked <b>with</b> <b>Fat</b> Les and co-wrote several songs with Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Marianne Faithfull.|$|E
5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes <b>with</b> <b>fat</b> tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|After signing <b>with</b> <b>Fat</b> Wreck Chords, Tintari and White {{left the}} band. The {{remaining}} members then {{spent the next}} few months looking for another drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band Good Riddance found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' phone number to Principe, and after listening to Transistor Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E

5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were <b>with</b> <b>Fat</b> Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were <b>with</b> <b>Fat</b> Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off <b>with</b> <b>Fat</b> Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

25|$|The swimbladders of {{deep sea}} fish are either absent or {{scarcely}} operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs.

25|$|The {{production}} of foie gras (the liver of a duck or a goose {{that has been}} specially fattened) involves the controversial force-feeding of birds with more food than they would eat in the wild, and more than they would voluntarily eat domestically.

25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well <b>with</b> <b>fat</b> taking away excess heaviness.

25|$|Inflammation of the {{pancreas}} {{is known as}} pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent gallstones or chronic alcohol use, although {{a variety of other}} causes, including measles, mumps, some medications, the congenital condition alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and even some scorpion stings, may cause pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central abdomen, that often radiates to the back, and may be associated with jaundice. In addition, due to causing problems <b>with</b> <b>fat</b> digestion and bilirubin excretion, pancreatitis often presents with pale stools and dark urine.|$|E
25|$|Kashrut: As {{indicated}} in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a young goat {{may not be}} boiled in its mother's milk.

25|$|The {{development}} of secondary sex characteristics in women {{is driven by}} estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated {{at the time of}} puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after menopause. Thus, estradiol produces breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, estradiol induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (<b>with</b> <b>fat</b> deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks), and maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and epiphyseal closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Mammographic density {{refers to}} the {{relative}} proportions of radiodense area compared to the radiolucent area on a mammogram, which is basically an x-ray of the breast. The radiodense area on a mammogram is white and is associated with ductal and lobular epithelium, connective tissue and fluid in the breast. The radiolucent area is dark gray or black and is associated <b>with</b> <b>fat</b> in the breast. High mammographic density {{is associated with a}} higher risk of developing breast cancer, but the reasons for this link are not certain and are being studied. Conversely, patients with very low mammographic breast density were found to hold a poorer prognosis irrespective of age, BMI and menopausal status.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} {{of water and}} methanol (W/M) fractions {{on the performance of}} a compression ignition engine fuelled <b>with</b> animal <b>fat</b> (obtained from duck) emulsions is studied. A single cylinder air-cooled, direct injection diesel engine developing a rated brake power output of 2. 8 kW at 1500 r/min is tested using diesel neat animal fat, and animal <b>fat</b> emulsions <b>with</b> different fractions of W/M. Results show reduced peak pressure <b>with</b> neat animal <b>fat</b> when compared <b>with</b> diesel. Animal <b>fat</b> emulsions result in increased peak pressure with increased W/M fractions. Ignition delay is quite high <b>with</b> neat animal <b>fat.</b> Increase in W/M amounts in the emulsions further increase the ignition delay. Heat release pattern shows improved combustion rates <b>with</b> animal <b>fat</b> emulsions at all W/M fractions when compared <b>with</b> neat animal <b>fat.</b> Drastic reduction in smoke emission from 3. 6 m(- 1) <b>with</b> neat animal <b>fat</b> to a minimum of 0. 5 m(- 1) is achieved <b>with</b> the animal <b>fat</b> emulsion at the maximum W/M fraction. NO emission is found to be lower <b>with</b> neat animal <b>fat</b> than <b>with</b> neat diesel. Animal fat emulsions further reduce NO emission at all W/M fractions. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are also reduced significantly <b>with</b> animal <b>fat</b> emulsions at all W/M ratios when compared <b>with</b> neat animal <b>fat.</b> In general, animal <b>fat</b> emulsions <b>with</b> different W/M fractions show considerable reduction in all emissions and improvement in engine performance when compared <b>with</b> neat animal <b>fat.</b> Emulsion of 10 W 10 M 2 S 83 (i. e. 10 per cent of water, 10 per cent of methanol, and 2 per cent of span 83 by volume) is found to be the best among the three tested emulsions for optimum performance and emissions...|$|R
