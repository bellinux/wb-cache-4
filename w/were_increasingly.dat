5|$|During that period, the Byzantines were {{generally}} on the defensive, and suffered some catastrophic defeats {{such as the}} razing of Amorium, the home city of the reigning Byzantine dynasty, in 838. Nevertheless, with the waning of the Abbasid Caliphate's power after 842 {{and the rise of}} semi-independent emirates along the Byzantine eastern frontier, the Byzantines <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> able to assert their own power.|$|E

5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{denied access to}} their {{traditional}} hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E

5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1473 in Cracow (Kraków), the {{printing}} business kept growing. By {{the turn of}} the 16th/17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth, 8 in Cracow, the rest mostly in Danzig (Gdańsk), Thorn (Toruń) and Zamość. The Academy of Kraków and Sigismund II possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> common at noble courts, schools and townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as {{by the end of the}} 16th century almost every parish ran a school.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1580s, {{a number}} of churches {{patterned}} after the Church of the Gesù in Rome had been built. Gothic and other older churches <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> being supplemented with Baroque style architectural additions, sculptures, wall paintings and other ornaments, which is conspicuous in many Polish churches today. The Royal Castle in Warsaw, after 1596 the main residence of the monarchs, was enlarged and rebuilt around 1611. The Ujazdów Castle (1620s) of the Polish kings {{turned out to be}} architecturally more influential, its design having been followed by {{a number of}} Baroque magnate residencies.|$|E

5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several {{variants}} of the Panzer I were designed, {{especially during the}} later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the PanzerI chassis <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> adapted as tank destroyers and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{production}} in the East Texas Oil Field and oil prices stabilized. Though the major urban areas continued to grow, the extreme growth patterns {{of the first three}} decades began to slow. As western Texas and the panhandle region began to be more fully explored, the Permian Basin gradually became the top producing area of the state. Though independent oil companies were still {{an important part of the}} industry for some time, the major new strikes <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> made by established companies. World War II helped complete the state's transition to an industrialized and urbanized state with oil facilitating the transition.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums {{of his own money}} in doing so.|$|E

5|$|Capital {{and energy}} of urban enterprisers {{affected}} {{the development of}} mining and metallurgy during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. Great ironworks furnaces were built in the first half of that century. Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Charles Buller Heberden became {{principal}} in 1889. He saw sporting {{as a means}} to the institution of civility than an end in itself; together with Richard Lodge, it was this spirit that dominated his tenure as principal. Academic rigour was reintroduced to the college, and the staff of Brasenose <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> successful in maintaining discipline. Until the end of the century, however, the number of students achieving blues outnumbered those attaining firsts. Author John Buchan joined in 1895, a man of this new era– although his work continued to portray Brasenose as its previous muscular stereotype. Heberden was also the first lay principal, although he was personally committed to the church– purchasing an organ for the chapel out of his own personal funds. Brasenose was frequently represented as boasting no academic prowess at all. Three of the ten fellows were set aside for non-classicists; a Junior Common Room (JCR) was created in 1887; in 1897 the library was opened up to undergraduates; in 1899, Fellows were granted a right to sabbatical leave. The fellows themselves <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> secular; only four of fourteen fellows were clergy.|$|E
5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Union {{released}} its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940. This was followed by a series of films penned by Saeroen which <b>were</b> <b>increasingly</b> oriented towards the Indies' growing intelligentsia and attempted to distance themselves from the theatrical conventions which were common in the contemporary film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism. Following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s.|$|E
