Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 {{percent of their}} normal earnings.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{through the}} 86th Amendment Act, Article 21(A) was incorporated.

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 1904 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Boletus rugosiceps. The type collection <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods of Port Jefferson, New York. Rolf Singer transferred it to Leccinum in 1945. Synonyms include Krombholzia rugosiceps, published by Rolf Singer in 1942, and Krombholziella rugosiceps, published by Josef Šutara in 1982. Krombholzia and Krombholziella are now obsolete genera that {{have since been}} subsumed into Leccinum.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E

The next day, {{an agreement}} to evacuate the JNA from Šibenik <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village of Žitnić near Drniš.

5|$|Following the 2005 ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk to reporters {{following}} the loss. Vick, who picked up a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in that game, also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the 2006Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' defensive end Elvis Dumervil. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology <b>was</b> <b>made.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> wake of the incident, Virginia Tech officials announced {{that they would be}} conducting a review of Vick's conduct on and off the field.|$|E
5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in {{the ceiling of the}} gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E
5|$|On-farm {{factories}} in the Deloraine area made cheese, mostly cheddar, during the early 20th century. Cheese <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Meander area from at least 1908 when a factory opened on the Cheshunt estate. The last of the area's factories closed prior to World War II. Meander had a resident blacksmith from c.1876, though blacksmithing had been done on private properties before this. Blacksmithing as a separate industry continued into the early 20th century. Prompted by new legislation in the 1980s, that enforced hygiene standards in animal slaughtering, a slaughter-house was opened in Meander. It was registered in 1986. Before this butchering was a more informal or back-yard industry.|$|E
5|$|Springbok colours is {{the name}} given to green and gold blazers awarded {{to members of the}} South Africa {{national}} rugby union team. They were historically awarded to all South African teams and individuals representing the country in international competition following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name 'Springbok' was abandoned by the various control boards since they felt that the term had been abused by the previous apartheid governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement. An exception <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the national rugby union team where they have retained the practice of awarding colours.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{advance in}} this region {{developed}} into three drives. In the west, forces advanced north from Sattelberg following its capture, while in the east, an advance was made from North Hill on the coast, north of Scarlet Beach, where the Australians had landed earlier in the campaign. A smaller drive <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre from Nongora, which lay in between the two, although this was limited and subsequently linked up with the coastal drive. Although possessing significant forces, the Australian advance proved slow. Heavy rain and harsh terrain slowed the Australian resupply efforts and reduced the mobility of their manoeuvre elements. Disease and fatigue also heavily depleted their infantry, with more casualties being suffered from illnesses than combat.|$|E
5|$|The Library of Gray's Inn {{has existed}} {{since at least}} 1555, when the first mention of it <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> will of Robert Chaloner, who left some money to buy law books for the Library. The Library was neither a big {{collection}} nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a room that was also used for mooting and to store the deed chest. The collection grew larger {{over the years as}} individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.|$|E
5|$|The Mahavira's teachings were {{gradually}} lost after around 300BC, {{according to}} the Jain tradition, when a severe famine in the Magadha region of ancient India caused a scattering of the Jain monks. Thereafter, attempts were made by Jain monks to gather again, co-recite the canon, and re-establish it in its entirety. These efforts identified differences between recitations of the Mahavira's teachings, and an attempt <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5thcentury AD to reconcile the differences. However, the reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions continuing with their own incomplete, somewhat {{different versions of the}} Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written down in palm leaf manuscripts.|$|E
