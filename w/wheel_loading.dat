50|$|Wheel bearing torque losses can be {{measured}} as a rolling resistance at the wheel rim, Crr. Railroads normally use roller bearings which are either cylindrical (Russia) or tapered (United States). The specific rolling resistance in Russian bearings varies with both <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> and speed. Wheel bearing rolling resistance is lowest with high axle loads and intermediate speeds of 60-80 km/h with a Crr of 0.00013 (axle load of 21 tonnes). For empty freight cars with axle loads of 5.5 tonnes, Crr goes up to 0.00020 at 60 km/h but at a low speed of 20 km/h it increases to 0.00024 and at a high speed (for freight trains) of 120 km/h it is 0.00028.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a novel method for dynamic alignment control using infrared light depth imagery to enable automated <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> operation for the trim and final automotive assembly line. A key requirement for automated <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> is {{to track the}} motion of the wheel hub and simultaneously identify the spatial positions and angular orientations of its alignment features in real-time on a moving vehicle body. This requirement is met in this work, where low-cost infrared depth-imaging devices like Microsoft Kinect™ and Asus Xtion™, vastly popular in the gaming industry, are used to track a moving wheel hub and recognise alignment features on both the wheel hub and the wheel in real time in a laboratory environment. Accurate control instructions are then computed to instruct the automation system to rotate the wheel to achieve precise alignment with the wheel hub and load the wheel at the right time. Experimental results demonstrate that the reproducibility error in alignment control satisfies the assembly tolerance of 2 mm for the <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> operation, and thus the proposed method can be applied to automate wheel assembly on the trim and final automotive assembly line. The novelty of this work lies in its use of depth imaging for dynamic alignment control, which provides real-time spatial data in all 3 axes simultaneously as against the popularly reported RGB imaging techniques that are computationally more demanding, sensitive to ambient lighting and require the use of additional force sensors to obtain depth axis control data.

40|$|Conventional {{construction}} of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements (JPCP) in Canada consists of placing a round steel epoxy-coated dowel at the mid {{height of the}} pavement. Steel dowels reduce stepping at the joint to improve comfort and reduce the stress concentration on the support layer beneath the pavement. Most importantly they transfer load and are {{commonly referred to as}} load transfer devices. Problems with dowel bar deterioration, including corrosion causes the slab joint to lock and cause stress concentrations as the slab expands and or contracts and curls due to thermal and shrinkage straining occurring in the concrete. In this research, alternative joint load transfer devices are presented and compared to conventional steel dowels. Four device alternatives are developed and evaluated: a Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) I-beam placed directly on the base material; GFRP tapered plates; a continuous horizontal V device; and a continuous horizontal pipe device both placed directly on the support layer. The two devices that are continuous run the length of the joint similar to a shear key. The GFRP tapered plate and I-beam, as well as conventional steel dowels, were analyzed in a wheel path sized three dimensional finite element model for <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> and static loading applied to either side of the joint. An experimental testing program was developed to test joint load transfer capabilities of each device when subjected to a static wheel load applied to either side of the joint. The GFRP tapered plates and I-beams were shown to transfer load based on the results from the wheel path finite element model and experimental testing program. The differential joint deflection, stress concentrations and plastic straining occurring in the concrete is not reduced with either the tapered plate or I-beam compared to a dowel under <b>wheel</b> <b>loading.</b> In addition, a similar plastic straining area identified in the finite element models were noticed as an area of damage in the experimental testing program. All of the devices developed are analyzed in a quarter slab three dimensional finite element model with shrinkage and thermal strains as well as <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> applied to the slab to simulate service loading. A detailed investigation into the stress distribution around the devices and the differential deflection at the joint through the service loading applied is presented in this paper. Similarly to the wheel path investigation the stress concentration in the tapered plate and I-beams are greater than conventional dowels and also have greater differential deflection occurring at the joint. Both the continuous Horizontal V and Horizontal Pipe device reduce stress and plastic straining in the concrete during the service load analysis compared to dowels. During daytime <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> the differential deflection in the joint is the lowest with no noticeable stepping occurring at the joint with the Horizontal V device; however is greater than conventional steel dowels under nighttime wheel load application.

To this end, the current study focuses on <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> management with the aim to establish <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> monitoring and mitigation actions (in terms of limits on allowable wheel defects) that minimize traffic disruptions. As a first step, the relation between <b>wheel</b> impact <b>load</b> magnitudes (resulting from the out-of-round wheels) and critical rail crack sizes {{that would result in}} rail breaks is established. Variations in parameters such as track stiffness, rail temperature, impact load characteristics and hanging sleepers etc. are investigated and a “bad case scenario” that implies severe, but realistic operational conditions is established. In this manner allowable <b>wheel</b> impact <b>load</b> magnitudes can be linked to pertinent critical crack sizes that must be identified during inspections. An interesting finding is that thermal stresses have such a major effect that a seasonal variation in allowable <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> limit seems justified.

We were inspired to launch an investigation for {{soil compaction}} determination at three levels of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> (1, 2 and 3 kN), three levels of velocity (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 m/s) and at 1, 2 and 3 passages of wheel with three replications on clay-loam soil. Experiments were conducted utilizing a single wheel-tester inside a soil bin. Penetration resistance and soil sinkage were determined as soil compaction indices. Data were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at. % 1 significance level. Results indicated that the highest penetration resistance of 260 kPa occurred at a depth of 210 mm, third pass, <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> of 3 kN and velocity of 0. 5 m/s. The lowest penetration resistance of 121 kPa was at 1 kN <b>wheel</b> <b>load,</b> first pass and at a velocity of 1 m/s.

40|$|Subsoil {{compaction}} affects {{all aspects}} of soil quality, and contrary to topsoil compaction it is persistent. Natural alleviation processes such as wetting/drying, freezing/thawing and biological activity including root growth decrease rapidly with depth. In compacted soil, these alleviation processes are moreover diminished because root growth and biological activity are reduced and soil water contents remain higher in compacted than in well-structured soil. <b>Wheel</b> <b>loads</b> are still increasing and, in consequence, the extent and severity of subsoil compaction. Sustainable soil management requires the uncompromising criterion that no subsoil compaction can be accepted. Consequently, only field traffic with <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> lower than the carrying capacity of the subsoil is allowed. This implies that subsoil stress caused by <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> should not exceed {{the strength of the}} subsoil. Therefore, this chapter emphasises the importance of soil strength and the calculation of soil stresses in the subsoil. One of the main constraints in using the carrying capacity concept proves to be the lack of data on soil strength. Existing recommended limits for <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> and inflation pressures are not adequate and can result in over or underestimating of allowable <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> and subsequent uneconomical solutions or subsoil compaction. Adequate drainage of soils is a prerequisite for reduced subsoil compaction. Mouldboard ploughing with all tractor wheels on the non-ploughed ‘land’ and umbilical systems for applying manure slurry are realistic options to reduce compaction. Controlled traffic systems that limit the wheeled area may be implemented by the use of wide span vehicles and by steering tractors along traffic lanes. Although we support such provisions, our chapter will advocate and focus primarily on adjusting <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> to the carrying capacity of the subsoils. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{developments}} in grinding {{have opened up}} new avenues for finishing of hard and brittle materials with nano-surface finish, high tolerance and accuracy. Grinding with superabrasive wheels is {{an excellent way to}} produce ultra-precision surface finish. However, superabrasive diamond grits need higher bond-ing strength while grinding, which metal-bonded grinding wheels can offer. Truing and dressing of the wheels are major problems and they tend to glaze because of <b>wheel</b> <b>loading.</b> When grinding with superabrasive wheels, <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> can be avoided by dressing periodically to obtain continuous grinding. Electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) is the most suitable process for dressing metal-bonded grinding wheels during the grinding process. Nano-surface finish can be achieved only when chip removal is done at the atomic level. Recent developments of ductile mode machining of hard and brittle materials show that plastically deformed chip removal minimizes the subsurface damage of the workpiece. When chip deforma-tion takes place in the ductile regime, a defect-free nano-surface is possible and it completely eliminates the polishing process. ELID is one of the processes used for atomic level metal removal and nano-surface finish. However, no proper and detailed studies have been carried out to clarify the fundamental characteristics for making this process a robust one. Consequently, an attempt has been made in this study to understand the fundamental characteristics of ELID grinding and their influence on surface finish...|$|E

40|$|The {{engineering}} design process consists of many stages. In the conceptual phase, potential designs are generated and evaluated without considering specifics. Winning concepts then {{advance to the}} detail design and high fidelity simulation stages. At {{this point in the}} process, very accurate representations are made for each design and are then subjected to rigorous analysis. With the advancement of computer technology, these last two phases have been very well served by the software community. Engineering software such as computer-aided design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have become an inseparable part of the design process for many engineered products and processes. Conceptual design tools, on the other hand, have not undergone this type of advancement, where much of the work is still done with little to no digital technology. Detail oriented tools require a significant amount of time and training to use effectively. This investment is considered worthwhile when high fidelity models are needed. However, conceptual design has no need for this level of detail. Instead, rapid concept generation and evaluation are the primary goals. Considering the lack of adequate tools to suit these needs, new software was created. This thesis discusses the development of that conceptual design application. Traditional design tools rely on a two dimensional mouse to perform three dimensional actions. While many designers have become familiar with this approach, it is not intuitive to an inexperienced user. In order to enhance the usability of the developed application, a new interaction method was applied. Augmented reality (AR) is a developing research area that combines virtual elements with the real world. This capability was used to create a three dimensional interface for the {{engineering design}} application. Using specially tracked interface objects, the user 2 ̆ 7 s hands become the primary method of interaction. Within this AR environment, users are able perform many of the basic actions available within a CAD system such as object manipulation, editing, and assembly. The same design environment also provides real time assessment data. Calculations for center of gravity and <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> can be done with the click of a few buttons. Results are displayed to the user in the AR scene. In order to support the quantitative analysis tools necessary for conceptual design, additional research was done in the area of metamodeling. Metamodels are capable of providing approximations for more complex analyses. In the case of the <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> calculation, the approximation takes the place of a time consuming FEA simulation. Two different metamodeling techniques were studied in this thesis: polynomial response surface (PRS) and polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). While only the <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> case study was included in the developed application, an additional design problem was analyzed to assess the capabilities of both methods for conceptual design. In the second study, the maximum stresses and displacements within the support frame of a bucket truck were modeled. The source data for building the approximations was generated via an FEA simulation of digital mockups, since no legacy data was available. With this information, experimental models were constructed by varying several factors, including: the distribution of source and test data, the number of input trials, the inclusion of interaction effects, and the addition of third order terms. Comparisons were also drawn between the two metamodeling techniques. For the <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> models, third order models with interaction effects provided a good fit of the data (root mean square error of less than 10...|$|E
