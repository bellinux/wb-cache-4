40|$|This paper {{considers}} the important requirement for <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> necessary for its immaculate operation, since any failure can endanger {{the ship and}} render it useless.

A modular model has been developed in Simulink/Matlab for the simulation {{of the dynamics of}} <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion.</b> The developed model considers the <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> system as a set of three main modules: the engine, the propeller and the ship hull. The developed <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> dynamics model has been validated {{with a wide range of}} experimental data from a 500 kW test engine (MAN B&W 5 L 16 / 24), coupled to a four quadrant electric brake (AEG), installed at the test-bed of the Laboratory of Marine Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA/LME). The model was then used for the investigation of marine diesel engine behavior during load changing including some extreme maneuvering case scenarios such as Crash Stop, Full Astern and Full Ahead maneuvers. The resulting <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> model is a reduced order model, which can easily be used for detailed studies such as engine control during fast transient loadings, with accuracy and small computational cost.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown how model {{predictive}} control (MPC) can adapt to faults in certain circumstances. This paper describes how MPC was successfully implemented as a fault-tolerant controller for a single engine/propeller model of a <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> system. It is shown that the MPC controller can be tuned to be robust to internal faults that develop in the <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> system, {{even in the absence of}} any fault detection and isolation (FDI) information for the internal faults. For the case of sensor faults, it is assumed that FDI information is available and it is shown how the MPC controller, in combination with a Kalman estimator, can drastically improve the tracking response of the system in the presence of sensor faults. The paper concludes that MPC is a very good candidate for a fault-tolerant controller for the <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> system, requiring re-configuration only at the supervisory level, without the need for additional re-configuration in the lower-level control systems...|$|R

The design philosophy for future surface combatants stresses survivability, efficiency, and modularity {{through the use of a}} modern open architecture consisting of commercial off the shelf and dual use systems. An integrated propulsion and electrical power generation system which utilizes advanced, commercially viable power electronics and state of the art control and monitoring systems is viewed as the appropriate system for the future surface combatant. This study provides the designing naval engineer with technical background information and design considerations for the application of a cycloconverter drive for <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> in an integrated power system. The cycloconverter is a power electronic circuit which performs a single stage conversion of an ac input voltage at one frequency to an ac output voltage of variable frequency and amplitude.

40|$|One aspect in <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> system {{development}} is reliability and maintainability analysis. It {{is concerned with}} the level of confidence one has in the reliable operation of the plant. Reliability analysis deals with the configuration of the system, testing of components, extending component lifetime and component maintenance. [...] This research models a <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> system's reliability and maintainability in order to predict and to optimize the effectiveness of the <b>ship</b> <b>propulsion</b> system. A propulsion system of a shuttle tanker, M/T Mattea, is used as a model.

The objectives of this research is to review the process of evaluating a shuttle tanker propulsion system's reliability, maintainability, availability, and to investigate the computerised simulation statistical approach to help manage the information that is required in making intelligent maintenance and repair decisions...|$|R
