Charles Williams has described several reports on the subject which were submitted to MCC by its Amateur Status Standing Committee (ASSC) and, on 31 January 1963, the MCC committee unanimously agreed to abolish amateurism. <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> a substitute fixture was sought but it was decided not to pursue this as the new Gillette Cup limited overs competition was beginning in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Danny Williams, the Progressive Conservative premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, {{launched}} a campaign called Anything But Conservative, primarily targeted at Harper and the federal Conservatives.

Accordingly, all but one member of the provincial PC caucus supported not voting Conservative in this election.|$|E

He compares this to [...] "the great tradition" [...] for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as Roy Rogers and The Lone Ranger. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a [...] "youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive".|$|E

500|$|Szwarc {{said that}} the sequel's music should be [...] "more complex {{because it was a}} more complex film". <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> that this score is broader, {{allowing}} him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and [...] "fill the space" [...] created by the director. Williams used a larger ensemble than for the first film, and [...] "the orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes". Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions. Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams [...] "to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print." ...|$|E
500|$|The Life of Edward the Confessor, {{commissioned}} by his widow Edith, who was Harold's sister, is silent on her family's origin. In a section designed to eulogise her family, Godwin {{is described as}} [...] "blessed in his ancestral stock", but nothing further is said of this stock. In {{the view of the}} historian Frank Barlow: [...] "There is massive evasion here." [...] Historians generally discount a later medieval tradition that {{he was the son of}} a churl or a farmer. In her Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) article on Godwin's son, King Harold Godwinson, Robin Fleming says of Godwin: [...] "The origins of this parvenu are extremely obscure." [...] He was [...] "the quintessential new man". However, <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles reference to [...] "Wulfnoth cild the South Saxon" [...] implies a man of rank (cild means child, young man, warrior); his ability to detach twenty ships from the royal fleet suggests a man of at least local importance. Frank Barlow goes further, arguing that Godwin must have been of aristocratic origin, and that the family's massive land holdings in Sussex are indisputable evidence that the Wulfnoth who was Godwin's father was the Saxon thegn.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Basil <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> that {{although}} the plots continued year after year, [...] "there was never any serious danger to the dynasty."

2500|$|Theatre {{historian}} Gary Jay <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> {{the production}} was so influential {{that it became}} [...] "the reference point for Shakespearean performance practice in general over the next decade".

So innovative and distinctive was the production that it almost became a problem for directors, because [...] "the burden of reinventing the play now fell on every director." [...] However, it opened the door to much greater experimentation, so that [...] "twenty-five years after Brook's staging, the diversity of approaches is staggering to review".|$|E

In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a rock music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the 1970s, Williams helped lead its [...] "comedy renaissance," [...] writes critic Gerald Nachman.

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album originally began in 2005, with the songs being mostly mid-tempo contemporary R and soul songs, however, after playing the [...] "first sketch" [...] {{of the album}} to her mother, <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> she was [...] "challenged" [...] {{to go back and}} record songs that [...] "people could dance to" [...] and so in 2007 Williams began working extensively with producer, songwriter and arranger Rico Love to create an entirely new album â€“ which Williams would later sum up simply as [...] "unexpected". Unexpected fuses dance-pop, R and electronic music to form a wide selection of up-tempo, beat-driven, club-oriented songs which gradually calm into slower material more R in sound and style.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have also}} said it is {{detrimental}} to the presumption of innocence. [...] "It's {{a way for the}} police to try their case in the press and to get the intimation of guilt by virtue of an arrest," [...] says New York Civil Liberties Union director Donna Lieberman. [...] "The question is, does it poison the right to a fair trial? And that depends on each case." [...] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice observed that [...] "nder such circumstances, even Mother Teresa would look extremely suspicious, especially if her hands were cuffed behind her back." [...] Acknowledging a common response to such criticisms, that no arrested defendant is spared the perp walk, law professor Patricia <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> [...] "the perp walk is a social equalizer all right, but not in a good way" [...] since the United States leads the world in incarceration rates. [...] " [...] is hardly the greatest icon of equal rights".|$|E

6000|$|It was {{in truth}} {{his first public}} speech. At Silverbridge he had {{attempted}} to repeat a few words, and in his failure had been covered by the Sprugeons and the Sprouts. But now {{he was on his}} legs in a great room, in an unknown town, with all the aristocracy of the place before him! His eyes at first swam a little, and there was a moment in which he thought he would run away. But, on that morning, as he was dressing, there had come to his mind the idea of the possibility of such a moment as this, and a few words had occurred to him. [...] "My friend Frank Tregear," [...] he began, rushing at once at his subject, [...] "is a very good fellow, and I hope you'll elect him." [...] Then he paused, not remembering what was to come next; but the sentiment which he had uttered appeared to his auditors to be so good in itself and so well-delivered, that they filled up a long pause with continued clappings and exclamations. [...] "Yes," [...] continued the young member of Parliament, encouraged by the kindness of the crowd, [...] "I have known Frank Tregear ever so long, and I don't think you could find a better member of Parliament anywhere." [...] There were many ladies present and they thought that the Duke's son was just the person who ought to come electioneering among them. His voice was much pleasanter to their ears than that of old Mr. Williams. The women waved their handkerchiefs and the men stamped their feet. Here was an orator come among them! [...] "You all know all about it just as well as I do," [...] continued the orator, [...] "and I am sure you feel that he ought to be member for Polpenno." [...] There could be no doubt about that as far as the opinion of the audience went. [...] "There can't be a better fellow than Frank Tregear, and I ask you all to give three cheers for the new member." [...] Ten times three cheers were given, and the Carbottleites outside the door who had come to report what was going on at the Tregear meeting were quite of opinion that this eldest son of the former Prime Minister was a tower of strength. [...] "I don't know anything about Mr. Carbottle," [...] continued Silverbridge, who was almost growing to like the sound of his own voice. [...] "Perhaps he's a good fellow too." [...] "No; no, no. A very bad fellow indeed," [...] was heard from different parts of the room. [...] "I don't know anything about him. I wasn't at school with Carbottle." [...] This was taken as a stroke of the keenest wit, and was received with infinite cheering. Silverbridge was in the pride of his youth, and Carbottle was sixty at the least. Nothing could have been funnier. [...] "He seems to be a stout old party, but I don't think he's the man for Polpenno. I think you'll return Frank Tregear. I was at school with him;--and I tell you, that you can't find a better fellow anywhere than Frank Tregear." [...] Then he sat down, and I am afraid he felt that he had made the speech of the evening. [...] "We are so much obliged to you, Lord Silverbridge," [...] Miss Tregear said as they were walking home together. [...] "That's just {{the sort of thing that}} the people like. So reassuring, you know. What Mr. <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> about the dissenters is of course true; but it isn't reassuring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (I {{have also}} made {{considerable}} use of the geological part of Berghaus' [...] "Physical Atlas." [...] Beginning at {{the eastern side of}} the Pacific, I have added to the number of the volcanoes in the southern part of the Cordillera, and have coloured Juan Fernandez according to observations collected during the voyage of the [...] "Beagle" [...] ("Geological Transactions," [...] volume v., page 601.) I have added a volcano to Albemarle Island, one of the Galapagos Archipelago (the author's [...] "Journal of Researches," [...] page 457). In the Sandwich group there are no active volcanoes, except at Hawaii; but the Rev. W. Ellis informs me, there are streams of lava apparently modern on Maui, having a very recent appearance, which can be traced to the craters whence they flowed. The same gentleman informs me, that there is no reason to believe that any active volcano exists in the Society Archipelago; nor are there any known in the Samoa or Navigator group, although some of the streams of lava and craters there appear recent. In the Friendly group, the Rev. J. <b>Williams</b> <b>says</b> ("Narrative of Missionary Enterprise," [...] page 29) that Toofoa and Proby Islands are active volcanoes. I infer from Hamilton's [...] "Voyage in the 'Pandora'" [...] (Page 95), that Proby Island is synonymous with Onouafou, but I have not ventured to colour it. There can be no doubt respecting Toofoa, and Captain Edwards (Von Buch, page 386) found the lava of recent eruption at Amargura still smoking. Berghaus marks four active volcanoes actually within the Friendly group; but I do not know on what authority: I may mention that Maurelle describes Latte as having a burnt-up appearance: I have marked only Toofoa and Amargura. South of the New Hebrides lies Matthews Rock, which is drawn and described as an active crater in the [...] "Voyage of the 'Astrolabe'." [...] Between it and the volcano on the eastern side of New Zealand, lies Brimstone Island, which from the high temperature of the water in the crater, may be ranked as active (Berghaus [...] "Vorbemerk," [...] II Lief. S. 56). Malte Brun, volume xii., page 231, says that there is a volcano near port St. Vincent in New Caledonia. I believe this to be an error, arising from a smoke seen on the OPPOSITE coast by Cook ("Second Voyage," [...] volume ii., page 23) which smoke went out at night. The Mariana Islands, especially the northern ones, contain many craters (see Freycinet's [...] "Hydrog. Descript.") which are not active. Von Buch, however, states (page 462) on the authority of La Peyrouse, that there are no less than seven volcanoes between these islands and Japan. Gemelli Creri (Churchill's [...] "Collect." [...] volume iv., page 458), says there are two active volcanoes in latitude 23 deg 30', and in latitude 24 deg: but I have not coloured them. From the statements in Beechey's [...] "Voyage" [...] (page 518, 4to edition) I have coloured one in the northern part of the Bonin group. M. S. Julien has clearly made out from Chinese manuscripts not very ancient ("Comptes Rendus," [...] 1840, page 832), that there are two active volcanoes on the eastern side of Formosa. In Torres Straits, on Cap Island (9 deg 48' S., 142 deg 39' E.) a volcano was seen burning with great violence in 1793 by Captain Bampton (see Introduction to Flinders' [...] "Voyage," [...] page 41). Mr. M'Clelland (Report of Committee for investigating Coal in India, page 39) has shown that the volcanic band passing through Barren Island must be extended northwards. It appears by an old chart, that Cheduba was once an active volcano (see also [...] "Silliman's North American Journal", volume xxxviii., page 385). In Berghaus' [...] "Physical Atlas," [...] 1840, No. 7 of Geological Part, a volcano on the coast of Pondicherry is said to have burst forth in 1757. Ordinaire ("Hist. Nat. des Volcans," [...] page 218) says that there is one at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, but I have not coloured it, as he gives no particulars. A volcano in Amsterdam, or St. Paul's, in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, has been seen ("Naut. Mag." [...] 1838, page 842) in action. Dr. J. Allan, of Forres, informs me in a letter, that when he was at Joanna, he saw at night flames apparently volcanic, issuing from the chief Comoro Island, and that the Arabs assured him that they were volcanic, adding that the volcano burned more during the wet season. I have marked this as a volcano, though with some hesitation, on account of the possibility of the flame arising from gaseous sources.) ...|$|E
