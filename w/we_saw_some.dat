25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E

60|$|Near {{our camp}} (of which the {{elevation}} was 13,500 feet), radishes, barley, wheat, potatos, and turnips, were cultivated as summer crops, and <b>we</b> even <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> {{on the top}} of the terrace, 400 feet above our camp, or nearly 14,000 feet above the sea; these were grown in small fields cleared of stones, and protected by dykes.|$|R

6000|$|We passed but two crossing-places: at one {{the river}} is divided by an island, covered with the rude chaits and flags of the Boodhists. <b>We</b> also <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> Cooch fishermen, who throw the net much as we do: a fine [...] "Mahaser" [...] (a very large carp) was the best fish they had. Of {{cultivation}} there was very little, and the only habitations were a few grass-huts of the boatmen or buffalo herdsmen, a rare Cooch village of Catechu and Sal cutters, or the shelter of timber-floaters, who seem to pass the night in nests of long dry grass.|$|R
60|$|Here we {{travelled}} up {{into the}} country in search of our men, and made our signals, but had no answer to them, nor heard any intelligence of them. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> people here at a distance, scattering about; but they were but few, nor would they be brought by any means to converse with us, or come near us.|$|E
60|$|Lop-Ear and I did not linger long. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> of the part-grown boys {{shooting}} with bow and arrow, and we sneaked {{back into}} the thicker forest and made {{our way to the}} river. And there we found a catamaran, a real catamaran, one evidently made by some Fire-Man. The two logs were small and straight, and were lashed together by means of tough roots and crosspieces of wood.|$|E
60|$|In this chapel <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> painted {{windows of}} the time of James I., a period much subsequent, to the age when painted glass was in its glory; but the {{pictures}} of Scriptural people in these windows were certainly very fine,--the figures being as large as life, and the faces having much expression. The sunshine came in through some of them, and produced a beautiful effect, almost as if the painted forms were the glorified spirits of those holy personages.|$|E
60|$|Having {{tried to}} cheer {{them up to}} the best of my ability, which I fear I did without conviction, for in my heart I agreed with their view of the case, we {{returned}} to the guest-house and mounted the stair which led to the flat roof. Hence <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> curious ceremony was in progress in the centre of the market-place. At that distance we could not make out the details, for I forgot to say that my glasses had been stolen with the pistol and knife, probably because they were supposed to be lethal weapons or instruments of magic.|$|R

The rocks overlap each other, {{and there is a}} narrow channel some fifty yards long between them. Apparently this makes a sharp turn at the other end and opens out. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> nothing of the vessels we were chasing yesterday, but on high ground facing the channel there is a battery of six guns planted so as to rake {{anything}} coming in. There are some chains across the end. While we were lying on our oars there we were hailed." [...] And he then repeated the warning that had been given.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{our eyes}} became {{accustomed}} to the dazzling glare of the flaming pillars, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> great rite was in progress in the temple, for {{in front of the}} divine statue of Motherhood, white-robed and arranged in serried ranks, stood the company of the priests to the number of over two hundred, and behind these the company of the priestesses. Facing this congregation and a little in advance of the two pillars of fire that flared {{on either side of the}} shrine, Ayesha herself was seated in a raised chair so that she could be seen of all, while to her right stood a similar chair of which I could guess the purpose.|$|R
60|$|Take {{the house}} with the green blinds for instance. We know it is a quadrille party, because <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> men taking up the front drawing-room carpet while we sat at breakfast this morning, and if further {{evidence}} be required, and we must tell the truth, we just now saw one of the young ladies ‘doing’ another of the young ladies’ hair, near one of the bedroom windows, in an unusual style of splendour, which nothing else but a quadrille party could possibly justify.|$|E

60|$|January 7.--The sea still {{remained}} pretty well open, {{so that we}} had no difficulty in holding on our course. To the westward <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one whose summit {{could not have been}} less than four hundred fathoms {{from the surface of the}} ocean. Its girth was probably, at the base, three-quarters of a league, and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides. We remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it in a fog.|$|E

In 2009 <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> the global economical crisis rise to its peak with rippling effects to all sectors of life.

Wars and occupations continued despite the changes of heads of states and parties. On the other hand, at the end of 2009 everybody wished to think that perhaps the worst is behind us and we could start to look to a better future. In 2009 UNESCO’s list of World Heritage increased with 16 new sites varying from South-American archaeological sites to an Italian mountain range, English aqueducts and Chinese Buddhist temples. We continued to work all around the world in multiple projects – sometimes with frustrating but mostly with satisfying results...|$|R
25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her fore part was sunk very deep, and we watched her with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> at <b>some</b> distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|R
50|$|Stillman {{has said}} that the film was cut between its festival and {{theatrical}} runs:I felt the MPAA helped us out there. I'd hoped to get a PG-13 even with the Venice cut, but in the first viewing they thought it was R. So we looked at it, the editor Hafitz and I, and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> immediately <b>some</b> things that would make it pretty clearly PG-13, and we felt would help the movie. There could've been a little heaviness of talking a little too much about what was going on, and it would delay the laugh until later - which I think is always good. We were really happy with the small changes we made. We made tiny changes in two scenes: we took out the text for what the ALA stood for... I think it gave it a Lubitschean vagueness and delayed the laugh.|$|R

This is all {{the more}} strange, because, as <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> time back, the {{ruggedness}} of the stone is more pleasing to the modern than the mediæval, and he rarely completes any picture satisfactorily to himself unless large spaces of it are filled with irregular masonry, rocky banks, or shingly shores: whereas the mediæval could conceive no desirableness in the loose and unhewn masses; associated them generally in his mind with wicked men, and the Martyrdom of St. Stephen; and always threw them out of his road, or garden, to the best of his power.|$|E
60|$|In Limekilns {{we entered}} a small change-house, which we only {{knew to be}} a public by the wand over the door, and bought some bread and cheese from a good-looking lass that was the servant. This we carried with us in a bundle, meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore, that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> third part of a mile in front. As we went, I kept looking across the water and sighing to myself; and though I took no heed of it, Alan had fallen into a muse. At last he stopped in the way.|$|E

A road has been made from our country to this council fire, that we might treat about friendship; and as we came down the road, <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> that, by <b>some</b> misfortune or other, blood has lately been spilt on it.

25|$|At 7 in {{the evening}} of November 28 {{occurred}} a new paroxysm, during which the volcano vomited forth such masses of fire and ejecta that in my opinion, all the material ejected during so many months, if taken together, would not equal the quantity which issued at the time. The columns of fire and smoke ascended higher than ever before, increasing every moment in volume, and setting fire to the whole island, there being not the smallest portion of the latter which was {{not covered by the}} smoke and the glowing rocks and ashes. All this was accompanied by terrific lightning and thunder above, and violent shocks of earthquakes underneath. The cloud of ejecta, carried on by the wind, extended itself toward west and south with the result that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> already <b>some</b> stones fall close to our shore. I, therefore, shouted to all those who were still in the town to take to flight and we all ran off in a hurry; otherwise we would have been engulfed on the spot; as the waves of the angry lake began already to flood the houses nearest to the beach.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{emphasis}} on reflection {{is not very}} often applied in most professional preparation programs in the former Soviet Union area. University programs are mainly aimed at developing competencies and skills. Yet recently reflective processes have been conceived of as highly effective and indispensable for pre- and in-service professional training, usually through non- formal programs. This study investigates how students develop motivation to study theories by learning to connect them to professional practices {{with the help of}} written reflections. The data were collected from a sample of 80 students during the spring and fall semesters in 2011 - 2012 in the form of written papers. The content analysis of students’ papers is employed in this research work to reveal if there is any impact on student thinking as reflected in their written papers. In this research work we claim that reflective writing can make it visible how students find meaning in studying a theoretical course. From our gathered data <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> students have difficulty in seeing theoretical studies as meaningful and useful to them, that is why they need effective support in focusing on positive side of their learning and written reflections may be quite effective in this process...|$|R
60|$|There {{were none}} {{to meet us}} at the gates, and none stood by {{the doors of the}} huts within them, but beyond, from the cattle kraal that was in the centre of the huts, rose a dust and a din as of men {{gathering}} for war. Now some of those with me were afraid, and would have turned back, fearing treachery, and they were yet more afraid when, on coming to the inner entrance of the cattle kraal, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> five hundred soldiers being mustered there company by company, by two great men, who ran up and down the ranks shouting.|$|E

60|$|May 29th.--This {{morning we}} visited the Church of the Dominicans, where <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> quaint {{pictures}} by Fra Angelico, with {{a good deal of}} religious sincerity in them; also a picture of St. Columba by Perugino, which unquestionably is very good. To confess the truth, I took more interest in a fair Gothic monument, in white marble, of Pope Benedict XII., representing him reclining under a canopy, while two angels draw aside the curtain, the canopy being supported by twisted columns, richly ornamented. I like this overflow and gratuity of device with which Gothic sculpture works out its designs, after seeing so much of the simplicity of classic art in marble.|$|E
6000|$|After we {{had been}} walking many hours, the {{mackerel}} fleet still hovered in the northern horizon nearly in the same direction, but farther off, hull down. Though their sails were set they never sailed away, nor yet came to anchor, but stood on various tacks as close together as vessels in a haven, and we in our ignorance {{thought that they were}} contending patiently with adverse winds, beating eastward; but we learned afterward that they were even then on their fishing-ground, and that they caught mackerel without taking in their mainsails or coming to anchor, [...] "a smart breeze" [...] (thence called a mackerel breeze) [...] "being," [...] as one says, [...] "considered most favorable" [...] for this purpose. We counted about two hundred sail of mackerel fishers within one small arc of the horizon, and a nearly equal number had disappeared southward. Thus they hovered about the extremity of the Cape, like moths round a candle; the lights at Race Point and Long Point being bright candles for them at night,--and at this distance they looked fair and white, as if they had not yet flown into the light, but nearer at hand afterward, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> how <b>some</b> had formerly singed their wings and bodies.|$|R

I <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> men who had died crouched; other people told us that blood had been taken from them.|$|R
40|$|Clustering {{analysis}} is often applied to data, {{which can be}} measured in ratio scale. But in this work clustering methods are applied to binary data, and the research is made to compare hierarchical and partitive clustering methods and their efficiency. Monte-Carlo simulation method is used for getting binary data. Data is being created using binomial distribution with given parameters for creating well separated cluster, average separated clusters and poorly separated clusters. Binary data can only be measured in nominal scale and there are used specific distance measures to transform data to distance matrices. When data transformation is finished, clustering methods can be used. In this work we investigate hierarchical and partitive clustering methods. There are used 10 hierarchical methods with 10 different distance measures. We investigate how the error of certain method depends on these methods and distance measures, on cluster numbers, on different data distributions, on data property vector amount. Partitive clustering methods investigations include popular partitive k-means method. Investigation is about determining the number of clusters and computing how the error of method depends on cluster numbers and different data distributions. For analysis of clustering methods there were created algorithms with statistical analysis system SAS. Also program interface was created for easier way to analyse results. After investigation <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>some</b> methods perform well with binary data, but some are not very suitable...|$|R
