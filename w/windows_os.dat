Program FOX for {{ab initio}} crystal {{structure}} determination from powder diffraction uses global optimization algorithms {{to find the}} correct structure by making trials in the direct space. It is a modular program, capable of using several criteria for evaluating each trial configuration, e. g. combining neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns. The program describes the structural building blocks (polyhedrons, molecules etc.) with their internal coordinates (Z-matrices), thus allowing natural constraints on interatomic distances and angles. Identical atoms shared between neighboring building blocks, and special positions are handled with an automatic, adaptive method (Dynamical Occupancy Correction). Several algorithms (Simulated Annealing, Parallel Tempering) are currently available. The program {{is based on an}} object-oriented crystallographic library ObjCryst++ (programming language c++).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study characterizes and {{evaluates the}} effects of a {{thermoplastic}} polyester preform binder on a thermosetting vinyl ester resin. It was observed that the binder material is soluble in the resin and that the dissolution of the binder drastically affects the viscosity of the resin. It was determined that the binder can significantly delay the gel time, and influence the reaction kinetics of the resin. Additionally, results show that the binder concentration and extent of dissolution affect the mechanical and thermophysical properties of the resin. Higher binder concentrations and larger dissolution times resulted in increased tensile strengths, elongations, and glass transition temperatures of the matrix resin. In order to characterize binder dissolution times, an experimental technique was introduced in which the binder dissolution is correlated to increases in the resin viscosity. The results from this study quantify the affects of thermoplastic polyester binders on vinyl ester resin and provide the basis for refining the processing <b>window</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R
40|$|The major {{physiological}} function of milk is {{the transport of}} amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and minerals to mammalian offspring. Caseins, the major milk proteins, are secreted {{in the form of}} a micelle consisting of protein and calciumphosphate. We have analysed the role of the milk protein a-casein by inactivating the corresponding gene in mice. Absence of a-casein protein significantly curtails secretion of other milk proteins and calcium-phosphate, suggesting a role for a-casein in the establishment of casein micelles. In contrast, secretion of albumin, which is not synthesized in the mammary epithelium, into milk is not reduced. The absence of a-casein also significantly inhibits transcription of the other casein genes. a-Casein deficiency severely delays pup growth during lactation and results in a life-long body size reduction compared to control animals, but has only transient effects on physical and behavioural development of the pups. The data support a critical role for a-casein in casein micelle assembly. The results also confirm lactation as a critical <b>window</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Organizations that {{collect and}} use {{large volumes of}} {{personal}} inform-ation often use security audits to protect data subjects from inappropriate uses of this information by authorized insiders. In face of unknown incentives of em-ployees, a reasonable audit strategy for the organization is one that minimizes its regret. While regret minimization has been extensively studied in repeated games, the standard notion of regret for repeated games cannot capture {{the complexity of the}} interaction between the organization (defender) and an adversary, which arises from dependence of rewards and actions on history. To account for this generality, we introduce a richer class of games called bounded-memory games, which can provide a more accurate model of the audit process. We introduce the notion of k-adaptive regret, which compares the reward obtained by playing actions prescribed by the algorithm against a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary with the reward obtained by the best expert in hindsight against the same ad-versary. Roughly, a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary adapts her strategy to the defender’s actions exactly as the real adversary would within each <b>window</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R
40|$|The subventricular zone (SVZ) of many adult {{non-human}} mammals generates {{large numbers}} of new neurons destined for the olfactory bulb (OB) 1 – 6. Along {{the walls of the}} lateral ventricles, immature neuronal progeny migrate in tangentially-oriented chains that coalesce into a rostral migratory stream (RMS) connecting the SVZ to the OB. The adult human SVZ, in contrast, contains a hypocellular gap layer separating the ependymal lining from a periventricular ribbon of astrocytes 7. Some of these SVZ astrocytes can function as neural stem cells in vitro, but their function in vivo remains controversial. An initial report finds few SVZ proliferating cells and rare migrating immature neurons in the RMS of adult humans 7. In contrast, a subsequent study indicates robust proliferation and migration in the human SVZ and RMS 8, 9. Here, we find that the infant human SVZ and RMS contain an extensive corridor of migrating immature neurons before 18 months of age, but, contrary to previous reports 8, this germinal activity subsides in older children and is nearly extinct by adulthood.

We describe {{an extension of the}} deterministic metabolic control analysis (MCA) to the stochastic regime.

The summation theorems for flux variances and the control distribution of the flux variances is shown to depend {{on the size of the}} measurement time <b>window</b> (<b>ǫ)</b> within which reaction events are counted for measuring a single flux. It is found that the degree of the ǫ-dependency can become significant for processes involving multi-time-scale dynamics and is estimated by introducing a new measure of time scale separation. This ǫ-dependency is shown to be closely related to the power-law scaling observed in flux fluctuations in various complex networks. We also propose a systematic way to control fluctuations of reactant concentrations while minimizing changes in mean concentration levels by applying the stochastic sensitivities.

The game is an episodic followup set around the holiday season and {{takes place in a}} separate universe from the first game, in which the events of Bad Boys Love do not occur. The sequel, developed largely alongside the first game, makes reference to and explores several unresolved plot elements brought up in the first game's Bad Boys Love scenario that could not be fully addressed in its main narrative. Unlike the first game, Holiday Star is a mostly linear visual novel rather than an otome game, with more standalone scenarios and fewer branching plotlines.

40|$|Neuronal {{oscillations}} {{in various}} frequency bands {{have been reported}} in numerous studies in both humans and animals. While it is obvious that these oscillations {{play an important role in}} cognitive processing, it remains unclear how oscillations in various frequency bands interact. In this study we have investigated phase to power locking in MEG activity of healthy human subjects at rest with their eyes closed. To examine cross-frequency coupling, we have computed coherence between the time course of the power in a given frequency band and the signal itself within every channel. The time-course of the power was calculated using a sliding tapered time window followed by a Fourier transform. Our findings show that high-frequency gamma power (30 – 70 Hz) is phase-locked to alpha oscillations (8 – 13 Hz) in the ongoing MEG signals. The topography of the coupling was similar to the topography of the alpha power and was strongest over occipital areas. Interestingly, gamma activity per se was not evident in the power spectra and only became detectable when studied in relation to the alpha phase. Intracranial data from an epileptic subject confirmed these findings albeit there was slowing in both the alpha and gamma band. A tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system is inhibited during most of the alpha cycle whereas a burst of gamma activity at a specific alpha phase (e. g. at troughs) reflects a <b>window</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R
