Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E

5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W.

David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
