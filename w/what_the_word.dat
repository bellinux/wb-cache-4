I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> meant.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded use of {{the word}} [...] "cootie" [...] appears in Albert N. Depew's [...] World War I memoir, Gunner Depew (1918): [...] "Of course you know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'cooties' means....When you get near the trenches you get a course in the natural history of bugs, lice, rats and every kind of pest that had ever been invented." [...] The word may be derived from Malaysian kutu, a head louse. In North American English, children use the word to refer to a fictitious disease or condition, often infecting members of the opposite sex. Among children, the word [...] effectively serves as a device for enforcing separation of the sexes.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to one of}} these incidents, a friend of Lead Belly's, variously identified as either Lomax or Mary Elizabeth Barnicle joked that Washington was a [...] "bourgeois town." [...] Though Lead Belly did not know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "bourgeois" [...] meant, he was fascinated by the sound of it, and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip. The song came together quickly; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead Belly to write it. Lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment.|$|E
500|$|Tired {{of being}} the only boy in his class to have never kissed a girl, Butters {{purchases}} his first kiss from Sally, who sells kisses for $5. Having won the respect of his classmates, he devises a plan to advertise Sally's services to other unpopular boys at the school. Sally gives Butters a 40 percent cut for his advertising and managing services, and Butters soon turns the venture into a full-fledged [...] "kissing company" [...] by recruiting more girls to fill in during times in which Sally is busy. Upon learning about Butters' business, Kyle tells him that he is [...] "nothing but a common pimp". Oblivious to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> means, Butters attends a pimp convention where he seeks advice from more-experienced pimps, including one called Keyshawn. Afterward, he starts to mimic the pimp jargon, such as referring to Sally as his [...] "bottom bitch", and incorporating [...] "Do you know what I am saying?" [...] into his conversations.|$|E

500|$|The role of Mopsa was {{originally}} {{performed by a}} soprano; however, a later revision by Purcell stated that {{it was to be}} performed by [...] "Mr. Pate in woman's habit", presumably to have a grotesque effect and highlight the refrain [...] "No, no, no, no, no; no kissing at all" [...] in the dialogue between Corydon and Mopsa. Also, it is not entirely clear <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "countertenor" [...] means in this context. The record is ambivalent as to whether Purcell (himself a countertenor) used a tenor with a particularly high range (though lighter at the top) and tessitura (known sometimes as a haute-contre, the descendants of the contratenors alti of medieval polyphony) or a falsettist. It seems that throughout his career he used both. [...] However, purely for reasons of dramatic verisimilitude, it is more likely than not that the travesty role of Mopsa was taken by a falsettist, and the presence of a duet for two male altos ("Let the fifes and the clarions") makes it seem more probable that for this work falsettists were employed.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Reading is Fundamental", Castiel is awakened {{when the}} Word of God – a tablet with {{information}} inscribed by an angel as dictated by God – is found by Sam and Dean. Although his torment has driven him insane, {{he explains that}} taking on Sam's pain has helped relieve some of his past burdens. He then explains <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of God is, but is unable to read it. Two angels from his former garrison arrive in pursuit of Kevin, a prophet who was awakened by the Word of God and drawn to it. The angel Hester tries to kill Castiel out of anger for his past actions, but she is instead killed by Meg. The other angel offers Castiel the chance to return to Heaven with him, but Castiel declines, explaining that he feels he no longer belongs there. The other angel then leaves, taking Kevin away to safety. Castiel comments to the Winchesters that he finds it amazing {{that he does not}} know what he is going to do next, and teleports away after giving them his blood.|$|E
500|$|Chains of Olympus {{has been}} praised for [...] "fantastic" [...] {{graphics}} and [...] "tight and responsive" [...] controls. In 2008, IGN awarded Chains of Olympus the [...] "Best PSP Action Game", and in September 2010, it {{was listed as}} the best PSP game by GamePro. God of War III received praise for its graphics, in particular of Kratos; IGN stated that Kratos is [...] "perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in videogames." [...] IGN also said that God of War III [...] "redefines <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'scale' means with regards to videogames, as it throws you into scenes with Titans that are larger than entire levels in some other games." [...] God of War III received awards for [...] "Most Anticipated Game of 2010" [...] and [...] "Best PS3 Game" [...] at the 2009 and 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, respectively. The game also won the [...] "Artistic Achievement" [...] award at the 2011 BAFTA awards.

500|$|Also at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson {{noted that}} there were still [...] "a couple pickup shoots" [...] {{to do for the}} film to [...] "clarify the logic". Further content for the film's {{training}} sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences [...] "loved [...] and wanted more". Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August. Dan Harmon wrote material for these additional scenes, which Derrickson described as [...] "script analysis and dialogue work", not enough to receive credit in the film. Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to [...] "give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts." [...] Before the film's sets were demolished, [...] director Taika Waititi took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting Chris Hemsworth's Thor. The scene was for Ragnarok and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was [...] "kind of perfect" [...] to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to Doctor Strange as a mid-credits scene. A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential Doctor Strange sequel. Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective Doctor Strange scene, and [...] "kept throwing lines at" [...] Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film. Additional options Gunn filmed included: Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> excelsior meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being [...] "totally crazy"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, noting how the character [...] "HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!". Gunn felt the Garfield option was originally meant to appear in {{the final version of the}} film, but ended up being too long for the scene. By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.|$|E
