50|$|Circuit {{diagrams}} {{are pictures}} with symbols that have differed {{from country to}} country and have changed over time, but are now to a large extent internationally standardized. Simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device.

These <b>wirewound</b> resistors are now used only in high-power applications, smaller resistors being cast from carbon composition (a mixture of carbon and filler) or fabricated as an insulating tube or chip coated with a metal film. The internationally standardized symbol for a resistor is therefore now simplified to an oblong, sometimes with the value in ohms written inside, instead of the zig-zag symbol. A less common symbol is simply a series of peaks {{on one side of the}} line representing the conductor, rather than back-and-forth as shown here.|$|E

The key performance properties of each group are discussed and some recent improvements to manufacturing techniques and materials are presented, together with potential future developments. Some of the specific areas discussed include; tailoring of <b>wirewound</b> and metal oxide resistor designs and materials for pulse and fusing applications and modifications to thick film resistor patterns and trimming rules to increase power rating and pulse performance.

The small signal measurements show a relatively flat inductance profile, with a 10 % drop in inductance at 30 MHz. Inductance vs. dc bias current measurements show less than 15 % decrease in inductance at 500 mA current. The performance of the micro-inductors have also been compared to a conventional wire-wound inductor in a 20 MHz dc-dc converter.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a packaged silicon carbide (SiC) based MEMS pressure sensor system designed specifically for a conventional turbofan engine. The electronic circuit is based on a Clapp-type oscillator that incorporates a 6 H-SiC MESFET, a SiCN MEMS capacitive pressure sensor, titanate MIM capacitors, <b>wirewound</b> inductors, and thick film resistors. The pressure sensor serves as the capacitor in the LC tank circuit, thereby linking pressure to the resonant frequency of the oscillator. The oscillator and DC bias circuitry were fabricated on an alumina substrate and secured inside a metal housing. The packaged sensing system reliably operates at 0 to 350 psi and 25 to 540 C. The system has a pressure sensitivity of 6. 8 x 10 E- 2 MHzpsi. The packaged system shows negligible difference in frequency response between 25 and 400 C.

40|$|The {{promise of}} single Cooper pair quantum {{circuits}} based on tunnel junctions for metrology and quantum information applications is severely {{limited by the}} influence of “offset ” charges – random, slowly drifting microscopic charges inherent to many solid-state systems. A remedy is to shunt the junction with a sufficiently large inductance. However, the small value of the fine structure constant imposes a fundamental incompatibility between shunting with a <b>wirewound</b> inductor and providing correct electromagnetic environment for single Cooper pair effects. By employing the Josephson kinetic inductance of a series array of large capacitance tunnel junctions, we have solved this conundrum and realized a new superconducting artificial atom. Its energy spectrum manifests the anharmonicity associated with single Cooper pair effects combined with total insensitivity to offset charges. Quantum electrodynamics, the theory of interacting quanta of charge and quanta of electromagnetic radiation, imposes a fundamental asymmetry between electric charge and magnetic flux, expressed by the small value of the fine structure constant α = e...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{sensors and}} {{circuits}} are often exposed to extreme temperatures {{in many of}} NASA deep space and planetary surface exploration missions. Electronics capable of operation in harsh environments would be beneficial as they simplify overall system design, relax thermal management constraints, and meet operational requirements. For example, cryogenic operation of electronic parts will improve reliability, increase energy density, and extend the operational lifetimes of space-based electronic systems. Similarly, electronic parts {{that are able to}} withstand and operate efficiently in high temperature environments will negate the need for thermal control elements and their associated structures, thereby reducing system size and weight, enhancing its reliability, improving its efficiency, and reducing cost. Passive devices {{play a critical role in}} the design of almost all electronic circuitry. To address the needs of systems for extreme temperature operation, some of the advanced and most recently introduced commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) passive devices, which included resistors and capacitors, were examined for operation under a wide temperature regime.

The S. epidermidis RB 02 used was an isolate from a clinical specimen previously used in similar assays by our team [25]. Briefly, sterile 23 F Bio-Medicus femoral (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) <b>wirewound</b> polyurethane venous cannulas were cut into 5 -cm lengths, and each length was aseptically inserted {{at an angle}} approximately 30 ° into an agar plate containing the pH indicator bromocresol purple [30]. The cannula plates were separated into three groups, each group comprising of six replicate plates (n[*]=[*] 6). Group 1 had transparent dressing (Opsite, 7  cm[*]×[*] 7  cm) covering the insertion point; group 2 had TA (Histoacryl, 0.5  mL) applied at the insertion point and allowed to dry; group 3 was treated with both TA and transparent dressing. TA and transparent dressings were applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Unsecured cannulas lacking transparent dressing or TA were used as controls (n[*]=[*] 3).|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} very compact {{switched}} mode power supplies (SMPS) requires compact, high reliability transformers for operation at high frequencies (1 - 10 MHz) which possess excellent electrical isolation between {{primary and secondary}} windings. For conventional <b>wirewound</b> transformers, operation at high frequencies can present problems due to parasitic reactances, variable performance and complex manufacturing procedures. Thick-film techniques can seem to offer a possible solution to these problems. A programme of work was carried out at Kingston University in cooperation with ERA Technology Ltd. and Custom Interconnect Ltd. aimed at developing transformers for this application. A variety of thick-film planar transformer structures were fabricated and their use within high speed switching supplies was investigated. The effect of winding and ferrite core geometries on the power efficiency of the planar transformer was investigated {{and the results are}} presented. It was concluded that transformer power efficiency could be significantly improved by increasing the thickness of the winding conductors. A programme of work to investigate methods for achieving this is described.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{temperature}} sensors {{have been developed}} for wide-range temperature applications. The two sensors measure temperature in the range of - 190 to + 200 C and utilize a thin-film platinum RTD (resistance temperature detector) as the temperature-sensing element. Other parts used in the fabrication of these sensors include NPO (negative-positive- zero) type ceramic capacitors for timing, thermally-stable film or <b>wirewound</b> resistors, and high-temperature circuit boards and solder. The first type of temperature sensor is a relaxation oscillator circuit using an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) operational amplifier as a comparator. The output is a pulse train with a period that is roughly proportional to the temperature being measured. The voltage level of the pulse train is high-level, for example 10 V. The high-level output makes the sensor less sensitive to noise or electromagnetic interference. The output can be read by a frequency or period meter and then converted into a temperature reading. The second type of temperature sensor is made up of various types of multivibrator circuits using an SOI type 555 timer and the passive components mentioned above. Three configurations have been developed that were based on the technique of charging and discharging a capacitor through a resistive element to create a train of pulses governed by the capacitor-resistor time constant. Both types of sensors, which operated successfully over the wide temperature range, have potential use in extreme temperature environments including jet engines and space exploration missions...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{experimentally}} {{the effects}} of hydrogen addition in the intake manifold of a diesel generator operating with a 7 % biodiesel-diesel oil blend (B 7). An experimental apparatus setup was used to conduct performance and emissions tests in a single cylinder, air cooled diesel engine. This setup consisted of a generator set connected to a <b>wirewound</b> resistor load bank {{that was used to}} vary engine load. In addition, a flowmeter was used to determine hydrogen volumetric flowrate and a digital anemometer coupled with an air box to measure air flowrate. Furthermore, a digital precision electronic scale was used to measure engine fuel consumption and a gas analyzer was used to determine exhaust gas composition and exhaust gas temperature. A thermopar was installed near the exhaust collection to measure cylinder temperature. In-cylinder pressure was measured using an AVL Indumicro data acquisition system with a piezoelectric pressure sensor. An AVL optical encoder was installed in the crankshaft and synchronized with in-cylinder pressure in real time. The experimental procedure consisted of injecting hydrogen into the engine intake manifold at different mass concentrations of 2, 6, 8 and 10 % of total fuel mass (B 7 + hydrogen), which represented energy fractions of 5, 15, 20 and 24 % of total fuel energy respectively. Due to hydrogen addition, the total amount of fuel energy introduced increased and the generators fuel injection governor prevented any increases of engine speed. Several conclusions can be stated from the test results. A reduction in specific fuel consumption as a function of hydrogen concentration increase was noted. Likewise, carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) decreased as hydrogen concentration increased. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides emissions (NOx) increased due to average temperatures inside the cylinder being higher. There was also an increase in peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate inside the cylinder, since the fuel ignition delay was smaller due to hydrogen content increase. All this indicates that hydrogen promotes faster combustion and higher heat release rates and can be an important additive to all kind of fuels used in diesel generators...|$|E
