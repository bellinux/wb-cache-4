6000|$|Ours {{is a case}} of rebellion--so {{called by}} the resolutions before me--in fact, a clear, flagrant, and {{gigantic}} case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that [...] "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it," [...] is the provision which specially applies to our present case. This provision plainly attests the understanding of those who made the Constitution that ordinary courts of justice are inadequate to [...] "cases of rebellion"--attests their purpose that, in such cases, men may be held in custody whom the courts, acting on ordinary rules, would discharge. Habeas corpus does not discharge men who are proved to be guilty of defined crime, and its suspension is allowed by the Constitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> proved to be guilty of defined crime, [...] "when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nothing is {{clearer than}} that our pre-existence is a dream, having {{absolutely}} {{no basis in}} anything that we know or can hope to know. Of after-existence there {{is said to be}} evidence, or rather testimony, in assurances of those who are in present enjoyment of it--if it is enjoyable. Whether this testimony has actually been given--and it is the only testimony worth a moment's consideration--is a disputed point Many persons while living this life have professed to have received it. But nobody professes, or ever has professed, to have received a communication of any kind from one in actual experience of the fore-life. [...] "The souls as yet ungarmented," [...] if such there are, are dumb to question. The Land beyond the Grave has been, if not observed, yet often and variously described: if not explored and surveyed, yet carefully charted.

But of the Fatherland that spreads before the cradle--the great Heretofore, wherein we all dwelt if we are to dwell in the Hereafter, we have no account. Nobody professes knowledge of that. No testimony reaches our ears of flesh concerning its topographical or other features; no one has been so enterprising as to wrest from its actual inhabitants any particulars of their character and appearance, to refresh our memory withal. And among educated experts and professional proponents of worlds to be there is a general denial of its existence.|$|E
60|$|It may, perhaps, be said, that a {{constitution}} which gives equal influence, man for man, {{to the most}} and to the least instructed, is nevertheless conducive to progress, because the appeals constantly made to the less instructed classes, the exercise given to their mental powers, and the exertions which the more instructed are obliged to make for enlightening their judgment and ridding them of errors and prejudices, are powerful stimulants to their advance in intelligence. That this most desirable effect really attends the admission of the less educated classes to some, and even to {{a large share of}} power, I admit, and have already strenuously maintained. But theory and experience alike prove that a counter current sets in when they are made the possessors of all power. Those who are supreme over every thing, whether they be One, or Few, or Many, have no longer need of the arms of reason; they can make their mere will prevail; and those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> resisted are usually far too well satisfied with their own opinions to be willing to change them, or listen without impatience to any one who tells them that they are in the wrong. The position which gives the strongest stimulus to the growth of intelligence is that of rising into power, not that of having achieved it; and of all resting-points, temporary or permanent, in the way to ascendancy, the one which develops the best and highest qualities is the position of those who are strong enough to make reason prevail, but not strong enough to prevail against reason. This is the position in which, according to the principles we have laid down, the rich and the poor, the much and the little educated, and all the other classes and denominations which divide society between them, ought as far as practicable to be placed; and by combining this principle with the otherwise just one of allowing superiority of weight to superiority of mental qualities, a political constitution would realize that kind of relative perfection which is alone compatible with the complicated nature of human affairs.|$|E

6000|$|There are two {{different}} modes of organizing a federal union. The federal authorities may represent the governments solely, and their acts may be obligatory only on the governments as such, or they may have the power of enacting laws and issuing orders which are binding directly on individual citizens. The former is the plan of the German so-called Confederation, and of the Swiss Constitution previous to 1847. It was tried in America {{for a few years}} immediately following the War of Independence. The other principle is that of the existing Constitution of the United States, and has been adopted within the last dozen years by the Swiss Confederacy. The Federal Congress of the American Union is a substantive part of the government of every individual state. Within the limits of its attributions, it makes laws which are obeyed by every citizen individually, executes them through its own officers, and enforces them by its own tribunals. This is the only principle which has been found, or which is ever likely to produce an effective federal government. A union between the governments only is a mere alliance, and subject to all the contingencies which render alliances precarious. If the acts of the President and of Congress were binding solely on the governments of New York, Virginia, or Pennsylvania, and could only be carried into effect through orders issued by those governments to officers appointed by them, under responsibility to their own courts of justice, no mandates of the federal government which were disagreeable to a local majority would ever be executed. Requisitions issued to a government have no other sanction or means of enforcement than war, and a federal army would have to be always in readiness to enforce the decrees of the federation against any recalcitrant state, subject to the probability that other states, sympathizing with the recusant, and perhaps sharing its sentiments on the particular point in dispute, would withhold their contingents, if not send them to fight in the ranks of the disobedient State. Such a federation {{is more likely to be}} a cause than a preventive of internal wars; and if such was not its effect in Switzerland until the events of the years immediately preceding 1847, it was only because the federal government felt its weakness so strongly that it hardly ever attempted to exercise any real authority. In America, the experiment of a federation on this principle broke down in the first few years of its existence, happily while the men of enlarged knowledge and acquired ascendancy who founded the independence of the Republic were still alive to guide it through the difficult transition. The [...] "Federalist," [...] a collection of papers by three of these eminent men, written in explanation and defense of the new federal Constitution while still awaiting the national acceptance, is even now the most instructive treatise we possess on federal government. In Germany, the more imperfect kind of federation, as all know, has not even answered the purpose of maintaining an alliance. It has never, in any European war, prevented single members of the confederation from allying themselves with foreign powers against the rest. Yet this is the only federation which seems possible among monarchical states. A king, who holds his power by inheritance, not by delegation, and <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deprived of it, nor made responsible to any one for its use, is not likely to renounce having a separate army, or to brook the exercise of sovereign authority over his own subjects, not through him, but directly by another power. To enable two or more countries under kingly government to be joined together in an effectual confederation, it seems necessary that they should all be under the same king. England and Scotland were a federation of this description during the interval of about a century between the union of the crowns and that of the Parliaments. Even this was effective, not through federal institutions, for none existed, but because the regal power in both Constitutions was so nearly absolute as to enable the foreign policy of both to be shaped according to a single will.|$|E

40|$|The {{editors of}} this book have brought {{together}} a fine selection of scientific articles centred around the changing communications landscape in Africa. Indeed, the technological and political convergence of formerly separate communication areas (audio-visual media, telecommunications, informatics) is offering African countries new opportunities. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly filtering through into the African continent. However Africa has only taken its first steps on the path towards an information society and is far lagging behind when it is compared to the western countries. A new, invisible border, that seperates those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford ICTs and those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is</b> arising. This so-called digital divide could have far-reaching consequences. For ICTs give access to information. This information can lead to knowledge. And knowledge {{is a prerequisite for}} development. Therefore ICTs are considered to be promising technologies that {{can be one of the}} tools to stop the ongoing underdevelopment of Africa. Nevertheless it is also argued in this book that the way to go is long, difficult and problematic. Several authors have formulated recommendations which could be helpful to walk this complicated path towards an information society in Africa...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the happy ending in Greek tragedy â {{viewed as the}} first audiovisual mass-culture manifestation â, connecting features specifically assigned to tragedy and melodrama, such as ex-machina endings and the Aristotelian alogon, pathos, tears and moans, which gave Plato the main reason to oppose that form of art. Following Aristotleâs precepts in the Poetics, I {{will focus on the}} contradiction between chapters 13 and 14, in which he prescribes a happy and an unhappy ending. I have concluded that there is little difference between tragedy and melodrama as pertains to the exclusive features of Greek tragedy, but that there is a great difference when focusing on the features proposed by Aristotle, <b>who</b> therefore <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> held responsible for the shifting of tragedy towards melodrama...|$|R
