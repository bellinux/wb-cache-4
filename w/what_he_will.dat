25|$|Daken offers Evan {{a suit of}} Apocalypse's Celestial armor to do with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will,</b> {{secretly}} {{planning to}} control the new Apocalypse through the psychic abilities of the Shadow King. After Deadpool's failed attempt to rescue Evan, the boy dons the Celestial armor to prevent Wolverine's death at Daken's hands and nearly kills Brotherhood members Sabretooth and Mystique. Enraged by the lies he has been told and filled with new-found power from Apocalypse's armor, Evan prepares to attack Wolverine himself, but Wolverine convinces him of the ultimate futility of revenge. Evan is later visited by Deadpool at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Deadpool tells Evan he is not Apocalypse and that Deadpool {{will always be there}} for him when he needs him.|$|E
25|$|Haunted by {{the elder}} vampire, {{who serves as}} an example of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> become if he fails to find a cure, Kain persists, and, in a decisive showdown, Vorador vanquishes Malek while Kain kills Bane the Druid and DeJoule the Energist. Later, after he slays Azimuth the Planer and recovers a time-streaming device, Ariel informs Kain that he must instead {{prioritize}} the war against The Nemesis, whose armies threaten to conquer Willendorf. Kain convinces King Ottmar to rally his troops against the Legions in a final stand, but the battle proves disastrous. Ottmar perishes, the Willendorf forces are overwhelmed, and Kain, cornered, uses the time-streaming device to escape. He emerges 50 years in the past, and kills the younger version of The Nemesis from this era—the beloved King William the Just—to trigger a temporal paradox which expunges the Legions from the timestream. However, when Kain returns to the present day, he discovers that William's murder has sparked a renewed vampire purge.|$|E

One notable recording was Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine, a 1961 Cold War propaganda piece sponsored by the American Medical Association. In his speech, Reagan purports that Social Security is a socialist attempt to supplant private savings, and eventually concludes that, [...] "Pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do for a living.

500|$|The engine overhaul, and the {{replacement}} of a damaged topmast, delayed the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant {{that it was no}} longer practical to proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Shackleton decided to sail directly to Grytviken harbour in South Georgia. Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be sacrificed, but Shackleton hoped that this shortfall could be made up in South Georgia. He was vague about the direction the expedition should take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, [...] "The Boss says...quite frankly that he does not know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian and {{political}} scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon, [...] "How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?" [...] Nixon's biographers disagree {{on how he}} will be perceived by history. According to Ambrose, [...] "Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through {{in his second term}} and for his resignation." [...] Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional career, suggests that [...] "he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy". Aitken feels that [...] "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is upset}} that Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{will be leaving}} Dunder-Mifflin to join Athlead, Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) startup. He tries to browbeat Darryl into staying with Dunder-Mifflin by {{tallying}} up his perceived job failures since taking the Athlead job and holding a meeting on customer loyalty with a customer he describes as [...] "enraged", but who demurs at the characterization. When this is ineffective, Dwight joins Darryl's delivery run to make the job more [...] "fun", including ordering a milkshake at a fast food drive-through and throwing it at the server, shouting [...] "Fire in the hole!" [...] Morally outraged, Darryl forces Dwight to stay behind and clean up the mess, whereupon another customer pulls the same prank on Dwight himself. Darryl later laughs at footage of the event that has been uploaded onto the internet, {{saying that this is}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> miss when he moves to Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Two Weeks" [...] {{within a week}} of the episode's original release. In one minute-long clip, Michael asks Darryl for warehousing advice for his new paper company; Darryl gives Michael encouraging words about the new business venture before admitting, [...] "I'm messing with you. This doesn't sound like a good idea." [...] In a second one-minute clip, Michael tries stealing office supplies from the Dunder Mifflin office for his new company, until he is caught by Charles, who literally chases him out of the office; Charles then tries to describe what Michael's like to the camera but finds himself shocked into silence. In a final 38-second clip, Kelly visits Michael's office to ask <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do with his life, then starts talking about her own fantasy of running off to Mexico with Charles. B. J. Novak wrote a talking-head segment for Toby, where he compares Michael to a movie on a plane because [...] "it's not great, but it's something to watch, and when it's over you're like, how much longer is this flight? Now what?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's {{declared}} philosophy on court nominations {{was that}} [...] "we cannot ask a man <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do, {{and if we}} should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known." [...] Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862, and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862, and appointed December 8, 1862, had {{also served as a}} judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863, and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks like a {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E
500|$|Many {{have given}} {{suggestions}} as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a [...] "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|E

Only afterwards will he be something, and he will have made <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be." ...|$|E

25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>wills,</b> not on account of His suffering <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>wills</b> not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent.

2500|$|Nixon's {{domestic}} and foreign policy accomplishments as president were however, largely overshadowed by the scandals that enveloped his administration. Nixon was forced to resign from office after Congress began impeachment proceedings in reaction to the Watergate Scandal. He remains the only president to ever resign from office. Regarding his lasting legacy, historian Stephen Ambrose wrote, [...] "Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some have {{interpreted}} the writings as predicting {{a series of}} three antichrists. However, the name [...] "Mabus" [...] as a synonym for or embodiment of the third antichrist is not suggested by any of the Prophecies. In fact the verse in question (II.62) merely states that a character of a similar-sounding name (according to Lemesurier , a reference to the Flemish painter Jan Mabuse, contemporary with Nostradamus) will die. Otherwise, the reference says nothing about what [...] "Mabus" [...] will do or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be like.|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine will {{sometimes}} lapse into a [...] "berserker rage" [...] while in close combat. In this state he lashes {{out with the}} intensity and aggression of an enraged animal and is even more resistant to psionic attack. Though he loathes it, he acknowledges that it has saved his life many times, it being most notably useful when he faced the telepathic 'Mister X', as X's ability to read his mind and predict his next move in a fight was useless as not even Wolverine knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do next in his berserk state. Despite his apparent ease at taking lives, he mournfully regrets and does not enjoy killing or giving in to his berserker rages. Logan adheres to a firm code of personal honor and morality.|$|E
