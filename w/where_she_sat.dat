25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Milano {{contacted}} Ryan White, a schoolboy ostracized for having AIDS, and {{a fan of}} Milano's. She attended a big party for him <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> with him for six hours making friendship bracelets. They appeared together on The Phil Donahue Show, where Milano kissed White, {{in order to show}} that she could not catch the disease through casual contact with him.|$|E
25|$|A half-hour series {{produced}} for primetime Sunday evening viewing on ITV found then Big Breakfast presenter Gaby Roslin on location to introduce film {{of some of}} the natural world's most successful predators. Each of six shows focused on a particular species; Roslin went on African safari to focus on lions, leopards and African hunting dogs and to North America <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in a snake-pit with 50 serpents, sailed alongside killer whales and {{came face to face with}} a grizzly bear.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{had been}} {{practically}} abandoned {{for some years}} and was in a bad state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work {{that had been done}} by William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not then been molested. My mother used to sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and admire the gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to be looking at her no matter <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat.</b>|$|E
60|$|Corey {{made his}} way to the girl's {{presence}} with open trepidation, which was not allayed by her silence and languor. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> in the chair <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> the other night, but she was not playing with a fan now.|$|R
60|$|But in the grey, dusty railway-carriage {{when she}} had left him, {{he was like a}} man drugged, staring at <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> opposite.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Annie," [...] said Putney. He {{shook hands}} with her, and Mrs. Putney, who was there with Dr. Morrell, asked her <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat.</b>|$|R
500|$|Missouri {{returned}} {{to be part}} of the United States Navy reserve fleet at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, until 12 January 1995, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. [...] She remained in Bremerton, but was not open to tourists as she had been from 1957 to 1984. [...] In spite of attempts by citizens' groups to keep her in Bremerton and be re-opened as a tourist site, the U.S. Navy wanted to pair a symbol of the end of World War II with one representing its beginning. On 4 May 1998, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton signed the donation contract that transferred her to the nonprofit USS Missouri Memorial Association (MMA) of Honolulu, Hawaii. She was towed from Bremerton on 23 May to Astoria, Oregon, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in fresh water at the mouth of the Columbia River to kill and drop the saltwater barnacles and sea grasses that had grown on her hull in Bremerton, then towed across the eastern Pacific, and docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 22 June, just [...] from the Arizona Memorial. Less than a year later, on 29 January 1999, Missouri was opened as a museum operated by the MMA.|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, Falle {{spoke at}} the 57th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on a panel called [...] "Survivors Speak: Prostitution and Sex Trafficking" [...] that was {{sponsored}} by Coalition Against Trafficking in Women. That May, Falle spoke at a fundraiser for the Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary, an organization that supports sex workers in the city. It was her first time in Calgary since she {{had been part of}} the sex industry there. The fundraiser was called [...] "Cry of the Streets: An Evening for Freedom" [...] and raised money for Servants Anonymous Facilitates Exit, a women's shelter for those seeking to leave the sex industry. At the fundraiser, Falle advocated adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which decriminalized the selling of sex and criminalized pimping and the purchasing of sex. Falle argued in support of modelling prostitution law in Canada after Sweden's laws because she believes that prostitution cannot be regulated. At another time, she had said that [...] "it's not Canada's laws that make prostitution unsafe, it's the johns who are raping and abusing the women and their pimps." [...] Also in 2013, Falle said that the average age at which girls get involved in prostitution in Canada is 14, and that their emotional intelligence does not develop while in prostitution, preventing many of them from leaving. She also said that prostitution has grown significantly in Canada since she left the sex industry, and that most human trafficking victims in Canada were born and raised in Canada.|$|E

60|$|Nancy, rose {{quickly from}} the low chair <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> cutting {{the pages of a}} French novel.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{advanced}} on her <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> {{and grasped}} her firmly by the shoulders. Her face was inflexible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Grace, from <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> at her window, looking seaward, {{and waiting}} tremulously for her mother's next question.|$|E
60|$|At length {{she reached}} the avenue, and had to pass the spot <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> so long on that fatal night {{listening}} {{for the sound of}} her lover's horse, and watching her brother as he stood swinging his stick before the house. She shuddered as she did so, but she did walk by the tree <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had then <b>sat</b> shivering, and at last once more stood on the steps of her father's house.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw himself}} along the couch <b>where</b> <b>she</b> still <b>sat</b> and laid {{his head in}} her silken lap, her cool hand on his hot forehead, and {{continued}} in a muffled voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{subject to}} the sick-headache, ma'am!" [...] said Miss Ophelia, {{suddenly}} rising {{from the depths of}} the large arm-chair, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> quietly, taking an inventory of the furniture, and calculating its expense.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not quite}} call it {{across the street to}} me as I came up from <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on the piazza.|$|E
60|$|He came {{round the}} table to Isabel, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in a growing distraction, and lifted her by the waist from her chair.|$|E
60|$|The {{next night}} Staniford found her {{alone in the}} waist of the ship, and drew up a stool beside the rail <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat.</b>|$|E
60|$|They had at {{this moment}} {{reached the top of}} the steep slope below which the river ran brawling among the rocks, and Nora seated herself exactly <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> on the {{previous}} evening.|$|R
60|$|The young lady, to whom {{all eyes}} {{had been turned}} before, and were now turned again, stood up <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat.</b> Her father rose with her, and kept her hand drawn through his arm.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{was glad}} of his escort, {{it seemed to}} make it more bearable to have someone to speak to. In a few minutes they reached the spot <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> the day before. A crowd were already collected.|$|R
6000|$|Then Ellen shrieked, and {{forthwith}} burst [...] Into ungentle laughter; [...] 535 [...] And Mary shivered, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat,</b> [...] And never {{she smiled}} after.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don Ippolito has come, signorina," [...] said Nina, {{the next}} morning, {{approaching}} Florida, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in {{an attitude of}} listless patience, in the garden.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} Jantje, {{like a great}} snake in human form, came {{creeping}} in to <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat,</b> his yellow face shining with the raindrops.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} thinking,' he said, 'that it is a pity to disturb this room. I dare say Mrs. Meadows {{would prefer that}} below-stairs. It used to be her parlour, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> always <b>sat</b> when I first knew the house.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Payah kun,' {{said the}} Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the bare patch <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had eaten, and upon the place <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> down, and one became the great Indian Desert, {{and the other}} became the Desert of Sahara, and you can look {{them out on the}} map.|$|R
60|$|And {{then they}} had called her to a sofa, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> now <b>sat,</b> ensconced between them, {{chattering}} alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{she took}} a little mirror from a table near <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat.</b> Holding it to catch the fast-fading light, she studied her face seriously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Read out a piece," [...] said Tilly, from Mother's chair, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in state, {{finishing}} off {{the sixth}} woolen sock she had knit that month.|$|E
6000|$|Dorothy {{left him}} {{and went to}} her room, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down {{and tried to think}} hard. A Pink Kitten was curled up on the window-sill and Dorothy asked her: ...|$|E
60|$|The story went on, but the story-teller {{never once}} {{looked at the}} prince, even through her veil, though he on his side never moved his eyes from her.

60|$|Her energy again prevailed, {{and they}} {{passed into the}} firelight of the little kitchen, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had before <b>sat,</b> and ate, and dried her clothes.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} walked slowly into the drawing-room, halted, and stood staring at the heap of gold and yellow bills that Mr. Grainger had {{deposited}} {{in front of the}} place <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had <b>sat.</b> Her sensation was akin to sickness. She reached out with a kind of shuddering fascination and touched the gold.|$|R
