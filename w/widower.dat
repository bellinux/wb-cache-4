5|$|After {{the death}} of the Prince Imperial, Beatrice's brother, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, {{suggested}} that she marry their sister Alice's <b>widower,</b> Louis IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse, who had lost his wife to diphtheria in 1878. Albert Edward argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease. However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's <b>widower.</b> This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen was disappointed that the bill had failed, she was happy to keep her daughter at her side.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOlder <b>widowers</b> {{are more}} likely to remarry than older widowed women. However, {{relatively}} {{little is known about the}} attitudes of older <b>widowers</b> to new romantic relationships and remarriage or repartnering. In this study of 60 <b>widowers,</b> more than half spontaneously discussed their attitudes toward, and experiences of, these relationships. However, none of the <b>widowers</b> had remarried and of those who described themselves as repartnered only one was cohabiting. We examine these data in the light of Lopata's concept of ‘husband sanctification’ (1981). We identify four themes. First, some <b>widowers</b> do sanctify their late wives. Second, we argue that wife sanctification contributes to widowers' uncertainties about repartnering. Third, when <b>widowers</b> make decisions to repartner, wife sanctification does not appear to make an important contribution. Finally, there is evidence to suggest that wife sanctification influences how men refer to their new women friends. Thus, we conclude by arguing that wife sanctification influences widowers' decisions surrounding remarriage/repartnering...|$|R

5|$|The {{eleventh}} nocturne {{was written}} in memory of Noémi Lalo; her <b>widower,</b> Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of spousal death on {{estimated}} mortality between the <b>widowers</b> and widows among the middle aged and elderly in Taiwan. Subject data is obtained from the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Middle Aged and Elderly in Taiwan, a study conducted in 1996 that encompassed observations 50 {{years of age and}} older. Survey data was linked to 1996 - 2003 national death registry data. Cox proportional hazard model is used to determine the survival rates between the <b>widowers</b> and widows. Main empirical results confirm that the relatively higher mortality hazard associated with being widowhood groups regardless of <b>widowers</b> and widows. Nevertheless, widows face a higher mortality risk than <b>widowers</b> for who compared to their counterparts. In addition, the influences of family and social networks on mortality risk tend to be more important than health status. ...|$|R

5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her <b>widower</b> {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, {{with the emergence of}} the feminist movement {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E

After Anne's death, however, Richard named another nephew, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, the son of his elder sister Elizabeth. However, he was also negotiating with John II of Portugal to marry his sister, Joanna, a pious young woman who had already turned down several suitors because of her preference for the religious life.|$|E
