Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples of pottery in the <b>world.</b> <b>Around</b> 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E

5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E

5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> them; this technique gave rise to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E

In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E

5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
