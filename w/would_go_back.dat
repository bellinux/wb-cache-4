5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|The attackers {{had planned}} the attack several months {{ahead of time}} and knew some areas well enough to vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} Valparaiso on 23 July. After several {{walks in the}} area, Darwin {{obtained}} horses and on 14 August set off up the volcanic Andes with a companion. Three days later they spent an enjoyable day on {{the summit of the}} Bell mountain. Darwin visited a copper mine and spent five days scrambling in the mountains before going on to Santiago, Chile. On his way back, he fell ill on 20 September and had to spend a month in bed. It is possible that he contracted Chagas' disease here, leading to his health problems after his return to England, but this diagnosis of his symptoms is disputed. He learnt that the Admiralty had reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. FitzRoy had taken it badly, selling the ship and announcing they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to recheck his survey, then had resigned his command doubting his sanity, but was persuaded by his officers to withdraw his resignation and proceed. The artist Conrad Martens left the ship and took passage to Australia.|$|E

25|$|According to Elimam's studies, {{the origin}} of this {{language}} <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to over 3,000 years, being a singular evolution of the Punic language spoken by the Carthaginians under Amazigh influence. This Semitic language would be strongly Arabized after the Arab invasion to be virtually assimilated into the language of the conquerors.|$|E

25|$|Blanche is bewildered that Stella <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{with him}} after such violence. The next morning, Blanche rushes to Stella and {{describes}} Stanley as a subhuman animal, though Stella assures Blanche that she and Stanley are fine.

25|$|The Beuren chapel was consecrated to Saint Anthony, thus {{meaning that}} it <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the 12th century at the earliest. In the chapel in pre-Reformation times {{was a picture of}} the saint, which is {{likewise}} witnessed as the object of pilgrimages. Of the chapel, only the tower still stands today, for the nave was torn down about 1950, supposedly because it was falling into disrepair.|$|E

25|$|Over 300 kachinas {{were present}} in the worship and the Zia held {{religious}} festivals and ceremonies in which they asked the Kachinas to bring rain and make their crops grow.

After three days, they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> up.|$|E
25|$|Ovid's next poem, the Medicamina Faciei, a fragmentary work on women's beauty treatments, {{preceded the}} Ars Amatoria, the Art of Love, {{a parody of}} didactic poetry and a three-book manual about {{seduction}} and intrigue, which has been dated to AD 2 (Books 1–2 <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to 1 BC). Ovid may identify this work in his exile poetry as the carmen, or song, which was one cause of his banishment. The Ars Amatoria {{was followed by the}} Remedia Amoris in the same year. This corpus of elegiac, erotic poetry earned Ovid a place among the chief Roman elegists Gallus, Tibullus, and Propertius, of whom he saw himself as the fourth member.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

25|$|Midway {{through the}} season though, reports came out {{suggesting}} that two Major League Soccer teams were interesting in Chhetri, along with his international teammate Steven Dias. These two MLS sides were rumored to be the Los Angeles Galaxy and D.C. United. However, on 25 January 2009, Chhetri arrived in Coventry, England to begin a trial at Coventry City of the Football League Championship, thus rejecting MLS. Four days later though, Coventry City manager Chris Coleman {{said that they would}} not be following their interest in Chhetri. Four months later though, Chhetri said that he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Coventry City in June 2009 for another extended trial. That never materialized however.|$|E
25|$|At Valparaiso in 1834, while Charles Darwin {{was away}} from the ship {{exploring}} the Andes, the Admiralty reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. He took the criticism badly, selling the schooner and announcing they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to recheck his survey, then resigning his command with doubts about his sanity. The ship's officers persuaded him to withdraw his resignation and continue as planned once Darwin returned to the ship. FitzRoy continued his voyage, sailing on to the Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. He detoured to Bahia in Brazil on the return voyage {{so that he could}} carry out an additional check, to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements before returning to England.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{acknowledged}} that the British never paid such compensation to the Sultanate of Sulu but during a meeting of Maphilindo between the Philippine, Malayan and Indonesian governments in 1963, the Philippine government said the Sultan of Sulu wanted the payment of 5,000 from the Malaysian government. The first Malaysian Prime Minister at the time, Tunku Abdul Rahman said he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Kuala Lumpur and get on the request. Since then, the Malaysian Embassy in the Philippines issues a check {{in the amount of}} 5,300 ringgit (US$1710 or about 77,000 Philippine pesos) to the legal counsel of the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu. Malaysia considers the amount an annual “cession” payment for the land, while the sultan’s descendants consider it “rent”.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the real}} {{beneficiaries}} of the conflict were the Japanese. They were able to expand their influence in both Thailand and Indochina. The Japanese intention was to use Thailand and Indochina as their military bases to invade Burma and Malaya in the future. The Japanese won from Phibun a secret verbal promise to support them in an attack on British Malaya and British Burma (though he later <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on his word). Relations between Japan and Thailand subsequently stressed as disappointed Phibun switched to courting the British and Americans {{in the hopes of}} warding off what he saw as an imminent Japanese invasion. However on 8 December 1941, the Japanese invaded Thailand {{at the same time they}} invaded Malaya (immediately before the attack on Pearl Harbor because of the International Date Line. Pearl Harbor was attacked one and a half hours after Malaya and Thailand).|$|E
25|$|Jason and Sam {{first met}} {{when they were}} both arrested for aiding and abetting Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard). The two have often been caught in {{situations}} where they were in trouble with the law. The two started to interact more after Sam got involved with a married Sonny, and Jason tried to pay her off so that Sonny <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to his wife, Carly (then Tamara Braun). Sam refused, and the two were constantly fighting, even after Jason was assigned as Sam's bodyguard to protect her from Sonny's enemies. When Sam found out that she was pregnant with Sonny’s child, Jason asks Sam to say he's the baby's father, and let Sonny and Carly stay together for the sake of their sons, Michael (then Dylan Cash) and Morgan. Sam agrees to Jason's request and they almost marry, but Sam backs out because they are not in love and she still has feelings for Sonny.|$|E
25|$|To {{begin the}} conference season, the Bulldogs {{travelled}} to Firestone Fieldhouse on January 3 to play Pepperdine, {{where they would}} beat the Waves 78–62. David Stockton came off the bench and keyed the Zags with four steals to hold off a Pepperdine team that was down two with 12 minutes left. Despite scoring a season-low 43.4% from the field, Elias Harris scored 18 points and Kelly Olynyk added 16. Two days later, they went to Santa Clara and beat the Broncos 81–74. The team managed to withstand a Santa Clara rally late when Olynyk made a key putback with 1:55 remaining. He led the team with a career-high 33 points and 10 rebounds, while Harris added 14 points for the Zags. After this, Gonzaga <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home to play conference rival Saint Mary's, whom they would beat 83–78. Saint Mary's would have one field goal in the final minutes {{of the first half}} to help the Bulldogs to a 46–28 halftime advantage. However, Stephen Holt would hit three shots and two free throws in a 90-second span to cut the lead to 55–44. With 26 seconds left, Kevin Pangos missed and fouled Matthew Dellavedova, who made it 79–78. Gonzaga held on for the win and was led by 31 points from Olynyk.|$|E
