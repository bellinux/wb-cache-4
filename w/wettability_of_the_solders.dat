30|$|Flip-chip {{technology}} has been widely used in high-performance and high-density microelectronics packaging [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] due to shorter possible leads, lower inductance, higher frequency, better noise control, smaller device footprints, and a lower profile, such as smart card, laser emitting diode, and surface-acoustic-wave filter in telecom applications [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Flux coating is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key processes during flip-chip packaging; flux is applied on <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> bumps or substrate to remove the oxides, pre-bonding flip chip on the substrate before reflow, and increases <b>the</b> <b>wettability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> bump and improve assembly reliability [14, 15, 16]. Usually, flux coating can be achieved through dipping flux, ultrasonic flux, printing flux, and so on [17].

40|$|Both the {{experimental}} and the modelling techniques {{have been investigated}} and used to investigate factors that influence the formation, quality and reliability of electronic packaging interconnections formed using solder alloys and anisotropic conductive films (ACFs). <b>The</b> wetting behaviours <b>of</b> new lead-free solders (i. e. Sn- 2. 8 Ag- 0. 5 Cu- 1. 0 Bi and Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni) have been evaluated using the wetting balance test. This assessment ahs been performed for three soldering temperatures with three different types <b>of</b> fluxes. <b>The</b> results have been compared with the conventional Sn-Pb, Sn-Ag-Cu and Sn-Cu solders. It {{has been found that}} <b>the</b> <b>wettability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead-free <b>solders</b> is not as good as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sn-Pb <b>solder.</b> <b>The</b> additions <b>of</b> Bi into <b>the</b> Sn-Ag-Cu <b>solder</b> and Ni into <b>the</b> Sn-Cu <b>solder</b> improve <b>the</b> wettability that is strongly dependent on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flux and <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> temperature. In general, NC-flux is suitable for Cu-substrate whereas Ws-flux is suitable for Ni substrate, but for the Sn- 2. 8 Ag- 0. 5 -Cu solder on Ni substrate, good wettability has been observed with both the NC and the R-type fluxes. Computational modelling of this test has revealed that the increase in the depth and <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> bath has little effect on the wetting force, but the meniscus height decreases when the bath radius exceeds 14 mm. Dissolution of solid metals into liquid solders has been investigated through experiments and computer modelling. Microstructural studies have been carried out and <b>the</b> growth behaviours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermetallic compounds (IMCs) during wetting, solidification and isothermal ageing have been investigated. It has been found that <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> Bi into <b>the</b> Sn-Ag-Cu <b>solder</b> reduces <b>the</b> consumptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substrates and suppresses <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> IMCs during wetting and ageing. Similarly, <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> Ni into <b>the</b> Sn-Cu <b>solder</b> reduces both <b>the</b> consumptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substrates and <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> IMCs during wetting and short term ageing but enhances <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> IMCs during long term ageing. Experimental and computer modelling techniques have been used to measure the temperature in the ACF during bonding. The temperature in an ACF joint becomes very close to the required maximum bonding temperature within the first 1 s <b>of</b> bonding time. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> this temperature on the cure process and on the ACF physical properties such as loss modulus, storage modulus, and glass transition temperature has been investigated. It has been found that the higher the bonding temperature the more <b>the</b> curing degree <b>of</b> ACF is. Rapid changes occur in <b>the</b> physical properties <b>of</b> ACF at temperatures above the glass transition point. When the ACF is cured for a long time at a high temperature, the physical properties may degrade. <b>The</b> adhesion strength <b>of</b> ACF joint increases as the curing degree increases. However, when the ACF joint undergoes a thermal aging treatment, the adhesion strength increases for the samples bonded at lower temperatures, but decreases for the samples bonded at higher temperatures. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> increase in <b>the</b> contact resistance is dramatically higher for the samples bonded at lower temperatures than for those bonded at higher temperatures. Computer modelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isothermal ageing <b>of</b> ACF joint confirms that the thermal load causes <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adhesive matrix and generates high stresses on the conductive particle.

PbBi solder satisfies all these criteria, but restrictions on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> lead in <b>the</b> magnet industry are expected in the relatively near future, so new lead-free jointing techniques need to be developed. One approach is <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> superconducting lead-free solder materials. In our work, we have focussed on the In-Sn system and ternary systems involving In and Sn as two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements. Thermodynamic modelling has been used to produce ternary phase diagrams of potential alloy systems, and various formulations have been fabricated in order to explore how microstructure and phase chemistry influence <b>the</b> superconducting properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solders.</b> Alternative approaches to fabricating lead-free joints, including spot welding and cold-pressing, have also been investigated. These methods have <b>the</b> potential advantage <b>of</b> achieving direct NbTi-NbTi joints with no intermediate, lower performance superconducting material. The spot welding method produced joints with the best superconducting performance, signifiantly better than the currently used PbBi <b>solder,</b> but <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> reproducibility in this technique may be a problem from an industrial point of view. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{modeling method}} for <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lifetime <b>of</b> <b>solder</b> joints of relatively large solder area under cyclic thermal-mechanical loading conditions has been developed. The method {{is based on}} the Miner's linear damage accumulation rule and <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accumulated plastic strain in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack in large area <b>solder</b> joint. <b>The</b> nonlinear distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage indicator in <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joints have been taken into account.
