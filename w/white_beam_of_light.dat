60|$|So, for instance, {{having with}} a Lens 4-1/4 Inches broad, and two Prisms on either hand 6-1/4 Feet {{distant from the}} Lens, made such a beam of {{compounded}} Light; to examine the reason of the Colours made by Prisms, I refracted this compounded beam of Light XY with another Prism HIK kh, and thereby cast the usual Prismatick Colours PQRST upon the Paper LV placed behind. And then by stopping any of the Colours p, q, r, s, t, at the Lens, I found that the same Colour would vanish at the Paper. So if the Purple p was stopp'd at the Lens, the Purple P upon the Paper would vanish, {{and the rest of}} the Colours would remain unalter'd, unless perhaps the blue, so far as some purple latent in it at the Lens might be separated from it by the following Refractions. And so by intercepting the green upon the Lens, the green R upon the Paper would vanish, and so of the rest; which plainly shews, that as the <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> XY was compounded of several Lights variously colour'd at the Lens, so the Colours which afterwards emerge out of it by new Refractions are no other than those of which its Whiteness was compounded. The Refraction of the Prism HIK kh generates the Colours PQRST upon the Paper, not by changing the colorific Qualities of the Rays, but by separating the Rays which had the very same colorific Qualities before they enter'd the Composition of the refracted beam of white Light XY. For otherwise the Rays which were of one Colour at the Lens might be of another upon the Paper, contrary to what we find.|$|E

She saw two bright lights, one green and one red and could make out a {{dumbbell}} shaped object. Turning off the A5 to her village, her recently serviced car cut out twice. Then she noticed the sky was black and a brilliant <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> shone on the road ahead, then the normal colour of the sky returned {{but she could not}} account for 15 minutes of her time.|$|E
5000|$|After a {{four-year}} hiatus, and rumours {{of mental illness}} {{which turned out to}} be nothing more than exaggeration of Cobain's mercury poisoning from fillings in his teeth, the pair returned in 2002 with [...] "The Isness", a record heavily influenced by 1960s and 1970s psychedelia and released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous. It was preceded by Papua New Guinea Translations, a mini album which contained a mixture of remixes of FSOL's track as well as new material from The Isness sessions. The album received mixed press due to the drastic change in sound which was inspired by Cobain's and Dougan's (separate) travels to India and immersion in spiritualism, nevertheless the majority was positive with Muzik magazine offering the album a 6/5 mark and dubbing it [...] "...a <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from heaven..."

His head {{turns to look at}} a black book with the letters [...] "KSE" [...] (which stands for Killswitch Engage) printed on the cover and spine. He retrieves the book, causing other books to fall, and flips through it. This time, it is the woman who is seen in the pages staring back at the man.

60|$|When {{therefore}} the Hair {{in the first}} and second of these Observations was held in the <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the Sun's <b>Light,</b> and cast a Shadow which was border'd with three Fringes <b>of</b> coloured <b>Light,</b> those Colours arose not from any new modifications impress'd upon the Rays <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> by the Hair, but only from the various inflexions whereby the several Sorts of Rays were separated from one another, which before separation, by the mixture of all their Colours, composed the <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the Sun's <b>Light,</b> but whenever separated compose <b>Lights</b> <b>of</b> the several Colours which they are originally disposed to exhibit. In this 11th Observation, where the Colours are separated before the Light passes by the Hair, the least refrangible Rays, which when separated from the rest make red, were inflected at a greater distance from the Hair, so as to make three red Fringes at a greater distance {{from the middle of the}} Shadow of the Hair; and the most refrangible Rays which when separated make violet, were inflected at a less distance from the Hair, so as to make three violet Fringes at a less distance from the middle of the Shadow of the Hair. And other Rays of intermediate degrees of Refrangibility were inflected at intermediate distances from the Hair, so as to make Fringes of intermediate Colours at intermediate distances from the middle of the Shadow of the Hair. And in the second Observation, where all the Colours are mix'd in the white Light which passes by the Hair, these Colours are separated by the various inflexions of the Rays, and the Fringes which they make appear all together, and the innermost Fringes being contiguous make one broad Fringe composed of all the Colours in due order, the violet lying on the inside of the Fringe next the Shadow, the red on the outside farthest from the Shadow, and the blue, green, and yellow, in the middle. And, in like manner, the middlemost Fringes of all the Colours lying in order, and being contiguous, make another broad Fringe composed of all the Colours; and the outmost Fringes of all the Colours lying in order, and being contiguous, make a third broad Fringe composed of all the Colours. These are the three Fringes <b>of</b> colour'd <b>Light</b> with which the Shadows of all Bodies are border'd in the second Observation.|$|R
