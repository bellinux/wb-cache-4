40|$|Quaternary {{eutectic}} presents {{far more}} complexity than binary and ternary eutectics, and its understanding can offer fundamental {{knowledge of the}} microstructure formation in a multi-component system. Accurate characterization of the quaternary eutectic structure can provide experimental evidence to validate simulation models for the multi-phase solidification. In this study, a quaternary eutectic alloy with a composition of Al- 16. 74 Cu- 40. 54 Ag- 6. 46 Mg in wt% was directly solidified with a velocity of 0. 4 μm/s in a vertical type Bridgeman furnace. The composition of the constituent phases in the quaternary eutectic was determined by electron probe micro-analyzer, and their crystal structures were examined by x-ray diffraction. The quaternary eutectic is composed of α-Al, θ-Al 2 Cu, AgAlMg, and a new intermetallic phase considered as Ag 5 Mg 3 Al 2. The morphology of the eutectic phases, and their spatial distribution were studied in 3 D by a serial sectioning technique combined with the focused ion beam. The quaternary eutectic exhibits regular rod-like or fibrous morphology despite of the intermetallic nature of its three eutectic phases. Both the <b>rod</b> <b>splitting</b> and merging were observed common for all the eutectic phases in the 3 D analysis, while only the <b>rod</b> <b>splitting</b> can be determined in the 2 D analysis. Interconnected complex structures of <b>split</b> and merged <b>rods</b> of the AgAlMg and Ag 5 Mg 3 Al 2 phases were observed in the 3 D structure. Their formation is attributed to the higher tendency of the AgAlMg and Ag 5 Mg 3 Al 2 phases to split and branch {{to compete for the}} Ag and Mg elements. The phase fractions of the eutectic phases were determined in both 2 D and 3 D, and it is concluded that the 3 D measurement gives relatively better result. status: publishe...|$|R

The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the crank pins of the two inner drive axles via a second coupling rod.

Basic crafts, such as baskets, fish traps, wattle fences and wattle and daub house walls, were often woven from osiers or withies (rod-like willow shoots, often grown in coppices). One of the forms of Welsh coracle boat traditionally uses willow in the framework. Thin or <b>split</b> willow <b>rods</b> can be woven into wicker, which also has a long history.

In addition, tannin, fibre, paper, rope and string can be produced from the wood. Willow is also used in the manufacture of double basses for backs, sides and linings, and in making splines and blocks for bass repair.|$|R

The decomposition of the organometallic cluster, H 2 Fe 3 (CO) 9 PtBu, yielded iron phosphide (Fe 2 P) nanomaterials of various morphologies {{depending on the}} surfactants used for the decomposition. Branched nanostructures were observed {{as a result of}} crystal splitting in a few of the surfactant systems. Cross-shaped structures were also observed and attributed to the twinning of two individual bundles during growth as the result of an interrupted growth process. The role of the solvents in particular the use of oleic acid for the formation of nanorods, in the formation of Fe 2 P nanoparticles will be discussed. Magnetic measurements taken of a variety of different morphologies of these iron phosphide nanoparticles will also be presented. Fe 2 P nanoparticles were also isolated via the decomposition of other clusters, including Fe 3 (CO) (P tBu) 2, Fe 2 (CO) 6 (PHtBu) 2, Fe 4 (CO) 11 PtBu 2, and Fe 3 (CO) 10 PtBu. In order to study the mechanism by which the clusters decompose, the decompositions were monitored using infrared spectroscopy. For all of the systems studied, the clusters rearranged in the surfactant solutions, ultimately resulting in Fe 2 (CO) 6 (PHtBu) 2 prior to decomposition. This rearrangement is believed to be a result of the interaction of the clusters with the surfactants employed, suppored by the finding that the solid state decomposition of H 2 Fe 3 (CO) pPtBu was found to result in a combination of Fe 3 P, Fe 2 P, and Fe 3 O 4. In addition to the formation of the binary phases of transition metal phosphide nanomaterials, investigation into the formation of mixed metal phosphides of iron and manganese were also performed. For these experiments, H 2 Fe 3 (CO) 9 PtBu with a manganese source, either Mn 2 (CO) 10 or Mn(CO) 5 Br, were decomposed in a variety of surfactant systems. The resulting nanoparticles were only doped with manganese; pure stoichiometric phases were not isolated. Finally the functionalization of Fe 2 P <b>split</b> <b>rods,</b> T-shapes, and crosses with a gold shell was performed. Their optical properties were studied, and a redshift in the extinction maximum was seen as the shell thickness increased. This plasmon peak shift, as opposed to the trends seen in silica-Au core-shell structures as shell thickness increases, is attributed to the high permittivity of the Fe 2 P core...|$|R

Slightly convex isotherms were used to slowly increase the pattern spacing 2 from an appropriate starting value to the threshold spacing for rod elimination or rod-splitting instabilities allowing a quantitative determination of these thresholds {{as a function of}} the solidification rate V. We show that the threshold spacing for <b>rod</b> <b>splitting</b> obeys the general lambda similar to V- 1 / 2 scaling law of eutectic growth, whereas the threshold spacing for rod elimination deviates from this law at low V, exhibiting the same overstability effect as previously reported for lamellar eutectic patterns.

We also describe a spatially incoherent mode of oscillation that we observed in disordered rod-like patterns. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
