40|$|Solid Waste Management (SWM) {{system in}} Basrah has {{deteriorated}} recently {{to the point}} that only limited <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> is <b>undertaken</b> in certain urban areas and disposal is largely to uncontrolled dump sites. In this study, the technical, economical, and environmental aspects of three SWM scenarios were investigated aiming to compare the scenarios and select the most appropriate one for implementation. Scenario 1 was to consider waste disposal into a sanitary landfill. Scenario 2 added waste transportation to transfer station before disposal to a sanitary landfill. Scenario 3 considered waste sorting, recycling and composting followed by landfill disposal in an integrated treatment disposal facility. The current open dumping practice was considered as the baseline scenario. According to economic analysis, the benefits from the revenues of selling the produced recyclables and compost did not improve the ranking of scenario 3. However, scenario 3 has gained positive recognition due to the environmental benefits of waste recycling. Therefore, final recommendations were in favour of scenario 3, which has been approved by the UNICEF, as well. Currently the recommended scenario is under implementation in Basrah, Iraq...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—EU and UK Government {{targets for}} minimising and {{recycling}} household waste {{has led the}} responsible authorities to research the alternatives to landfill. In the work reported here the local <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> authority (Charnwood Borough Council) has adopted the aspirational strategy of becoming a “Zero Waste Borough ” to lead the drive for public participation. The work concludes that the separate <b>collection</b> of food <b>waste</b> {{would be needed to}} meet the two regulatory standards on recycling and biologically active wastes. An analysis of a neighbouring Authority (Newcastle-Under-Lyne Borough Council (NBC), a similar sized local authority that has a successful weekly food <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> service was <b>undertaken.</b> Results indicate that the main challenges for Charnwood Borough Council would be gaining householder co-operation, the extra costs of collection and organising alternative treatment. The analysis also demonstrated that there was potential offset value via anaerobic digestion for CBC to overcome these difficulties and improve its recycling performance...|$|R

40|$|The rising {{pressure}} of Population, {{together with the}} constantly changing technologies, and development perspectives, contribute to the ever increasing volumes of wastes in different forms. The solid and liquid wastes generated in the urban areas were considered a burden to the society, and hazardous to the environment. The {{fact is that the}} growth of consumerist culture and aimless throwing of refuse by the people created the outbreak of environmental pollution. Unhygienic environment and solid waste accumulation coincided with mosquito breeding which causes, the spread of most epidemics. The rationale behind most of the diseases is the unhygienic pattern followed by the people both in rural and urban areas. As an environmental package, the disposal of solid waste from different sources, such as house holds markets, commercial areas, slaughter houses, hospitals and industries, therefore assumed crucial importance. So {{as a part of the}} theory and practice, a study on the area, solid waste management of Arppukara Grama Panchayat of Kottayam district is taken into consideration. The study conducted here proposes, to examine the quality and quantity of the solid waste generated in the panchayat and also it's impact on the existing social, economical, environmental and ecological systems. Now Solid Waste Management is an important area of study with local bodies, viz, Panchayat, Municipality and Corporations. As apart of the obligations, street sweepings, market sweepings, and household <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> etc. were <b>undertaken...</b>|$|R

40|$|Management {{of urban}} solid <b>waste</b> implies the <b>collection,</b> transfer, {{treatment}} recycle, reuse {{and disposal of}} such <b>waste.</b> <b>Collection</b> of urban household solid waste traditionally rests with government agencies designated with such responsibility. Solid <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> begins from storage at the household level to the final treatment or disposal point and represents {{the most important aspect}} of urban solid waste management. Little has however been written on urban household solid <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> in Nigeria. Using empirical data from three urban areas of Anambra State, Nigeria, the paper examines the place of informal private solid waste collectors in household solid <b>waste</b> <b>collection.</b> The ANOVA technique is used to test the null hypothesis that the sample means of the distance to designated community/street solid <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> containers in the residential neighbourhoods of the three towns are equal.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{of local and}} regional factors that affect effective solid <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> {{plays an important role}} in choosing appropriate technology. <b>Waste</b> <b>collection</b> has grown to become a major challenge demanding daily response from waste managers and it becomes inevitable to provide stakeholders with necessary information to aid key decision-making. This paper provides a comprehensive and detailed review of local-based factors that affect <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> in Nigeria. Literature study and on-site observation were used for getting theoretical and useful information on the <b>collection</b> of <b>waste</b> in the study area. The study considered various standard collection technologies and their supporting factors in order to assess the effectiveness of existing methods. The current collection techniques existing in different parts of the country together with unique local factors for these various areas are reported. The findings in many cases reveal that the method of <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> adopted and equipment used are faced with many challenges. This paper revealed that there is no investment presently made on the existing development plan to initiate a modern <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> system.

40|$|Under {{the current}} waste {{legislation}} in both European Union and Czech Republic, material recovery is preferred over {{other types of}} municipal solid waste treatment. However, <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> systems have negative environmental impacts. This thesis deals with modeling and optimization of <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> routes, which should lower their impact. The model makes use of the ArcGIS software system and operations research to optimize routes. Inputs of the model are {{the amount of waste}} produced in the region, locations of the final facilities, and their capacities. The amount of waste produced per district was estimated to be the portion of total waste produced corresponding to the number of inhabitants of given district. Final facilities are the assorting lines. Distances between districts and final facilities were computed by Network Analyst Extension of ArcGIS. The index method assigns the assorting lines to districts in a way that minimizes total distance traveled by <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> vehicles, while respecting the capacity of the assorting lines. Outputs are <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> routes and the distance, per waste type, traveled by the <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> vehicles. The model allows changing the input data to observe changes in the <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> system. The model was applied to the data from the capital of [...] ...|$|R
