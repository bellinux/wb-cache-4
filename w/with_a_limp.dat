5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp.</b> He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, at age 45, Smythe again {{served in}} the Canadian Army. Initially, he was a captain {{in charge of a}} troop within the Canadian Officers Training Corps, based at the University of Toronto. In 1941, along with Colonel Richard Greer, he formed the 30th Battery, a sportsmen's {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{that was part of the}} 7th Toronto Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, Canadian Active Army. Smythe was made acting major and Officer Commanding. He was offered a higher rank to become the army's sports officer, but turned it down. After first serving on Vancouver Island to defend against Japanese attack, the Battery embarked in September 1942 to England. After being stationed in England for nearly two years, Smythe and his unit were sent to France in July 1944, where within three weeks he was badly wounded when the Germans bombed an ammunition depot. For the rest of his life he would walk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> and suffer bowel and urinary tract problems. He was sent back to Canada in September on a hospital ship.|$|E
5|$|Burke and Hare's next {{victim was}} a {{familiar}} figure {{in the streets of}} Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> caused by deformed feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.|$|E
60|$|It {{was going}} to be a lonely trip back. All the {{remaining}} seventeen of the crew were dead and their ashes were to be left on a strange planet. Back they would go <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limping</b> ship and the burden of the controls entirely on himself.|$|R

6000|$|Before Sir Patrick {{had done}} speaking, while Suffolk was {{frowning}} grimly in perplexity, <b>a</b> wild figure, <b>with</b> {{blood on the}} face, rushed forth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limping</b> run, crying 'Let the loons hang me and welcome, if they set such store by their lean old gander, but they shanna lay a finger on the Master.' ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1993, Khadr {{returned}} to Pakistan with his family, renting a comfortable house with its own garden in Hayatabad while he continued working with HCI despite his injuries. Without {{the use of his}} right hand and walking <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp,</b> Khadr found his injuries a frustrating dehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003 Persson was diagonosed with hip {{osteoarthritis}} {{and surgery}} was recommended. He {{chose to go}} through Sweden's public health-care system instead of seeking private treatment; he was put on a waiting list, and finally received a hip replacement operation in June 2004. During that 9-month period he walked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> and reportedly was on strong painkillers; he had to cancel several official trips due to the pain he was in.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, 2007, Bork {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} New York City against the Yale Club over an {{incident}} that had occurred a year earlier. Bork alleged that, while trying to reach the dais to speak at an event, he fell, because of the Yale Club's failure to provide any steps or handrail between the floor and the dais. (After his fall, he successfully climbed to the dais and delivered his speech.) According to the complaint, Bork's injuries required surgery, immobilized him for months, forced him to use a cane, and left him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp.</b> In May 2008, Bork and the Yale Club reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.|$|E
50|$|As an outlaw, Peer {{struggles to}} build his own cottage in the hills. Solveig turns up and insists on living with him. She has made her choice, she says, {{and there will be}} no return for her. Peer is delighted and welcomes her, but as she enters the cabin, an elderly-appearing woman in green {{garments}} appears <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limping</b> boy at her side.|$|R

25|$|Carney, {{youngest}} of six sons (Jack, Ned, Robert, Fred, Phil, and Art) {{was born in}} Mount Vernon, New York, the son of Helen (née Farrell) and Edward Michael Carney, who was a newspaper man and publicist. His family was Irish American and Roman Catholic. He attended A. B. Davis High School. Carney was drafted into the United States Army as an infantryman and machine gun crewman during World War II. During the Battle of Normandy serving in the 28th Infantry Division, he {{was wounded in the}} leg by shrapnel and walked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> {{for the rest of his}} life. As a result of the injury, his right leg was 3/4-inch shorter than his left.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of her father in 1969, Rosemary was {{occasionally}} taken to visit relatives in Florida and Washington, D.C., and to her childhood home on Cape Cod. By that time, Rosemary had learned to walk again but did so <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp.</b> She never regained the ability to speak clearly and her arm was palsied. Her condition is sometimes credited as the inspiration for Eunice Kennedy Shriver to later found the Special Olympics, although Shriver told The New York Times in 1995 that that was not exactly the case. In 1983, the Kennedy family gave $1 million to renovate Alverno House. The gift added a therapeutic pool and enlarged the chapel.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{witnesses}} to the murder, of whom more than 25 have come forward to the police. The killer was described by witnesses as a man between 30 and 50 years of age, about 180 to 185 centimetres tall, and wearing a dark jacket or coat. Many described him as having walked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> or otherwise clumsily. No witness {{was in a position}} to observe the killer's appearance in any detail. A police sketch of the supposed killer was widely circulated in the media a week after the murder, leading to a massive influx of tips from the public, but it was later determined that the witness on whose statement it was based probably had not seen the actual assailant. No good description of the killer's appearance therefore exists. Witnesses agreed on the killer's escape route.|$|E

25|$|Craddock {{planned a}} career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new Triumph motorcycle. In July 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was {{shattered}} in a motorcycle crash. He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> and pain. He wore a steel sheath around the leg {{for the rest of his}} life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him, but some claim Craddock had been riding drunk. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea. He spent time in the Portsmouth Naval Hospital and was medically discharged from the Navy shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Gerry Evans: Gerry is {{initially}} portrayed as an intensely negative character, particularly by Kate, for having left Chris after fathering her illegitimate son, Michael. However, upon {{his first appearance}} in the play, Gerry is shown to be charming and genuinely affectionate towards Chris. His current job as a gramophone salesman (like his former job as a ballroom dancing instructor) represents his freedom, {{in sharp contrast to}} the stagnant lives of the Mundy sisters. This is made all the more obvious by the fact that he is leaving Ireland to join the International Brigade and fight in the Spanish Civil War, something that is further disapproved of by Kate. Through Michael's narration, we learn that Gerry is later left <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> after falling off a motorbike in Barcelona. As well as having romantic feelings for Chris, Gerry seems particularly inclined towards Agnes, although the true state of their relationship remains in doubt. We learn later that he secretly has another family back in Wales, and that all his proposals of marriage to Christina have been false. Adult narrator Michael reveals that, after Gerry's death in the 1950s, he had been contacted by a half brother in South Wales, who revealed that Gerry had had a wife and several sons there at the time depicted in the drama.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp.</b> Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance he was sure he prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E

500|$|The Usual Suspects {{consists}} {{mostly of}} flashbacks narrated by Roger [...] "Verbal" [...] Kint (Kevin Spacey), a con artist <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> and a palsied arm. Verbal has been granted {{immunity from prosecution}} provided he assists investigators, including Customs Agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and reveals all details of his involvement {{with a group of}} career criminals who are assumed to be responsible for the destruction of a freighter ship and the murder of nearly everyone on board. While Kint is telling his story, Kujan learns the name Keyser Söze from FBI agent Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) and demands Kint tell him what he knows.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} before the opening of the 1943 season, Stengel was hit by a vehicle while {{crossing}} Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, and he severely fractured a leg. He missed the first two months of the season, receiving many well-wishers, and reading get-well cards jokingly misaddressed to the hospital's psychiatric ward. For the rest of his life, Stengel walked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp.</b> At the end of the season, Braves management, tired of minimal progress, fired Stengel, and he received no immediate job offers. Stengel testified about this part of his career before a Senate subcommittee fifteen years later, [...] "I became a major league manager in several cities and was discharged. We call it discharged because there is no question I had to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{was in a}} coma for {{ten days}} after the crash and spent several months in the {{hospital}} recovering. She suffered a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, two broken legs, several broken ribs and a fractured pelvis. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. She went on to make an almost complete recovery, but continued to walk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp.</b> Vulović maintained that she had no memory of the incident and thus had no qualms about flying {{in the aftermath of the}} crash. Despite her willingness to resume working as a flight attendant, JAT decided to give her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity. Vulović became a celebrity in Yugoslavia and was deemed a national hero.|$|E

500|$|Coloman's father {{ascended the}} throne in 1074. Because Coloman and Álmos were minors {{when he died}} on 25April 1077, Géza's brother Ladislaus I succeeded him. The new king decided that Coloman should be {{prepared}} {{for a career in}} the Church. The king's decision was unusual as Coloman was older than Álmos and elder brothers were rarely ordained priests. The 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle stated that Coloman was [...] "of mean stature, but astute and quick of apprehension", adding that he was [...] "shaggy and hirsute, half-blind and humpbacked, and he walked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp</b> and stammered in his speech". If the chronicle preserved genuine tradition of his appearance, his physical deformity may have influenced his uncle's decision. However, modern scholars tend to refute this view, emphasizing that the chronicle was completed in the reigns of kings descending from Álmos.|$|E
500|$|Eddie stashes his {{belongings}} {{at the local}} bus terminal, where he meets Sarah Packard, an alcoholic who is supported by her father, attends college part-time, and walks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp.</b> He meets her again at a bar. They {{go back to her}} place but she refuses to let him in, saying he is [...] "too hungry". Eddie moves into a rooming house and starts hustling for small stakes. He finds Sarah again and this time she takes him in, but with reservations. Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah's and tries to persuade him to go back out on the road. Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge Fats again. Eddie realizes that Charlie held out his percentage and becomes enraged, believing that with that money he could have rebounded to beat Fats. Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to [...] "go lie down and die" [...] by himself.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the end of}} 1980, McCain {{decided to}} retire from the Navy. He had not been given a major sea command, and his {{physical}} condition had deteriorated, causing him to fail the flight physical required for any carrier command position (in addition to his limited arm movement, certain weather would always cause him to walk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>limp).</b> [...] McCain thought he might make rear admiral, but probably not vice admiral, and never become a four-star admiral as his grandfather and father had been. McCain later wrote {{that he did not}} anguish over his decision, although it pained his mother, who thought congressional careers paled in comparison to top naval ones. [...] He was excited by the idea of being a member of Congress and was soon recruiting a campaign manager that Cohen knew, for a planned run at a House seat from Arizona. In early 1981, Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, {{who did not want to}} see McCain leave the liaison post, told McCain that he was still on the path to be selected for one-star rear admiral. [...] McCain told Lehman that he was leaving the Navy and that he could [...] "do more good" [...] in Congress.|$|E
