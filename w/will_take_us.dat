[...] "This film will highlight landmark mainstream stories and provide a glimpse at others that will change the gender landscape of the world forever. Just as {{it is hard to believe}} that there ever was a time when different components of society were required to use separate drinking fountains, it is as incredible that one's gender expression remains just such a target for discrimination." [...] Jackson is working behind-the-scenes on the movie and will also take part in some of the on-camera interviews as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{sequence of}} events is unclear, as there are several versions concerning the revolt's development, {{some of which are}} considered mythological. Apparently the Africans went ashore and subsequently, under the direction of a high Igbo chief among them, walked in unison into the creek singing in the Igbo language [...] "The Water Spirit brought us, the Water Spirit <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> home". They thereby accepted the protection of their god Chukwu and death over the alternative of slavery. Roswell King, a white overseer on the nearby Pierce Butler plantation, wrote one of the only contemporary accounts of the incident which states that as soon as the Igbo landed on St. Simons Island they took to the swamp, committing suicide by walking into Dunbar Creek. A 19th-century account of the event identifies the captain by the surname Patterson and names Roswell King as the person who recovered the bodies of the drowned. A letter describing the event written by Savannah slave dealer William Mein states that the Igbo walked into the marsh, where 10 to 12 drowned, while some were [...] "salvaged" [...] by bounty hunters who received $10 a head from Spalding and Couper. According to some sources, survivors of the Igbo rebellion were taken to Cannon's Point on St. Simons Island and Sapelo Island.|$|E

She headed back east after she learned that an {{amendment}} to the U.S. Constitution had been proposed that would provide citizenship for African Americans but would also for the first time introduce the word [...] "male" [...] into the constitution. Anthony supported citizenship for blacks but opposed any attempt to link it with a reduction in the status of women.

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Omar Bongo's death, reports suggested that, due {{to the need to}} update the voters' roll, the elections might not be held within the 45-day period. Rogombé said on 20 June that preparations for the elections would involve a [...] "broad consultation with the active forces of the nation" [...] and that her decisions would be made [...] "under the triple seal of the constitution, consultations and consensus". In an interview on 22 June, Prime Minister Jean Eyeghé Ndong appeared to confirm this speculation, saying that [...] "it seems certain that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> more than 45 days". Under the constitution, a delay beyond 45 days is legally permissible in a case of force majeure. Eyeghé Ndong also said in the same interview that he would consider standing as a presidential candidate if he felt he had the necessary support. The news agency Agence France-Presse reported that sources variously expected that elections could be held in September 2009, {{in the last quarter of}} 2009, or as late as 2010.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2010, it was {{announced}} that India Longford (Beth Kingston) would be murdered after an experiment with online dating goes [...] "horribly wrong". Hollyoaks worked closely with the University of Central Lancashire's Cyberspace Research Unit on the storyline, in a bid to raise awareness of internet safety. Speaking on behalf of the Research Unit, Dr Jo Bryce commented: [...] "If the storyline can remind one young person to protect themselves when engaging in online activity, then that can only be a positive thing. Too many youngsters think they are immune to online risks and this storyline is a reminder that you don't always know who you're talking to online." [...] Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, added: [...] "This is a terrifying murder that highlights the dangers of meeting strangers online. The storyline, which launches at Christmas, <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> right through 2011 and audiences will be gripped {{to find out if the}} dangerous killer will strike again." [...] Marquess said he was surprised that the show had not done a big storyline about [...] "stranger danger" [...] on the internet before, branding it [...] "absolutely key Hollyoaks territory". Hollyoaks writer, Steve Hughes, explained that the storyline was inspired by a real-life incident, where a friend had her identity stolen on social networking service Facebook.|$|E
