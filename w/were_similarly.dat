5|$|Birdsong {{is one of}} Faulks's best-received {{works of}} fiction, both by the public and amongst reviewers. The British press offered {{considerable}} praise, with positive reviews from Today, The Guardian, The Observer, The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, The Sunday Express, The Sunday Telegraph, The Times Literary Supplement, The Spectator and The Scotsman. American and other international press reviews <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> positive.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time Maryland was shut out since 2004, when they <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> {{defeated}} by Virginia in Charlottesville, 16–0. It was Maryland's worst shutout loss since losing to Virginia in 1997, 45–0, and the largest margin of loss since losing to Virginia Tech in 2004, 55–6.|$|E
5|$|The M2A {{was sold}} {{on to be}} used by various private racers in the United Kingdom before being {{destroyed}} by fire in 1969. Sources suggest that three M2B chassis <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> sold on; one is awaiting restoration in the United States and another is currently on display at the Donington Grand Prix Exhibition.|$|E

50|$|During Truly's stint on {{the show}} Compo <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> often {{involved}} in dangerous situations against his will. Though Truly <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> pompous like his predecessors he eventually grew used to Compo's childish behaviour and the two did not argue frequently.|$|R

5|$|Three of {{the earlier}} T-68 fleet <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> equipped, and were known as T-68Ms. Mechanically and {{electrically}} the T-68M vehicles remained essentially a T-68, but had modifications to its brakes, mirrors, and speed limiters to suit the Eccles line. Initially only these vehicles were permitted to operate the Eccles line but the entire fleet except for 3 (1018, 1019, 1020) were modified between 2008 and 2012 for universal running, under a programme known as the T-68X Universal Running programme.|$|E
5|$|Bungie {{released}} a demo on May 24, 2010, featuring a single player level from the game's story mode, a multiplayer competitive map, and a cooperative firefight mission. Microsoft later listed Reach as an Xbox Live Marketplace download on August 12, 2010, {{at a price}} of 99999 Microsoft Points (~US$1250). A spokesperson confirmed the download was for media review purposes, {{and that there were}} no plans to distribute the game to the public through Games on Demand. Four days later, hackers managed to access, download, and distribute the game online; Microsoft stated they were investigating the matter. Halo 2, Halo 3, and ODST <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> leaked ahead of their planned release.|$|E
5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E
50|$|His son {{was also}} called Charles (Charles Ruthven Bickerton Blackburn AC), <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> a Lieutenant-Colonel for the Australian Army Medical Corps (World War II), and <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> {{associated}} with the University of Sydney, becoming the Bosch Professor and Head of the Department of Medicine in 1957.|$|R

5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Imperial troops mainly used Minié rifles, {{which were}} much more accurate, lethal, and had a much longer range than the smoothbore Gewehr guns, although, being also muzzle-loading, they <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> limited to two shots per minute. Improved breech-loading mechanisms, such as the Snider, {{developing}} {{a rate of about}} ten shots a minute, are known to have been used by troops of the Chōshū Domain against the Shogunate's Shōgitai, at the Battle of Ueno in July 1868. In {{the second half of the}} conflict, in the northeast theater, Tosa Province troops are known to have used American-made Spencer repeating rifles. American-made handguns were also popular, such as the 1863 Smith & Wesson Army No 2, which was imported to Japan by the Scottish trader Thomas Blake Glover and used by the Satsuma forces.|$|E

5|$|In week five, on Day 33, Big Brother punished Charlie for {{discussing}} nominations, {{telling him}} to remain silent {{for the rest of}} the day or else face the public vote. Later, Dogface and Kris <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> punished, also for discussing nominations. All three failed to keep quiet and faced the public vote, along with Halfwit and Marcus, who received the most nominations. On Day 35, the housemates failed the circus-themed shopping task and received a basic shopping budget. On Day 37, Kris became the sixth person to be evicted from the House with 63.0% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{was elected}} the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 until March 3, 1851. During the Thirty-first Congress, the Whig caucus {{considered}} {{him as a}} candidate for Speaker of the House. The voting for speaker began December 3, 1849. The caucus first chose Robert C. Winthrop as their candidate, but after several ballots, Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus. Some Whigs from northern states voted for David Wilmot, a Free Soiler, while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for Meredith Gentry. The Democrats <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> unable to muster a majority for their candidate, Howell Cobb.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1944 a train {{carrying}} 700 men on Schindler's {{list was}} initially {{sent to the}} concentration camp at Gross-Rosen, where the men spent about a week before being re-routed to the factory in Brünnlitz. Three hundred female Schindlerjuden <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent danger of {{being sent to the}} gas chambers. Schindler's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release. Finally after he sent his secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, the French arrested Long in {{the coastal}} town of Phan Thiết, some 160 {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} Saigon. His activities and proclamations had attracted the attention of French colonial officials, and just days before, the Resident of Kampot visited the Battambang temple and spotted the collection of white robes, which <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> styled to the uniforms worn during the 1909 uprising. However, Long's disciples were unaware that he had been arrested and continued with their plot. After nightfall on March 23, the bombs were taken into Saigon and placed at strategic points, with proclamation notices being erected in close proximity. None of the bombs successfully detonated. One source says that the bombs failed because the French authorities had defused all of them after uncovering the conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|On the left, {{the attacks}} by the 161st Brigade <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> {{weakened}} by loss of direction when the 1/5th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked Rafa Redoubt instead of Zowaiid trench. However, the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked and captured Beach and Sea Posts before attacking the Rafa Redoubt and trench systems, suffering light casualties. In support, a tank rolled out wire as it drove {{along the front}} line from Sea Post to Beach Post. Cricket Redoubt was captured {{with the help of}} the tank from Beach Post; although the tank was temporarily disabled in the process. After being repaired, the tank was transporting some engineers' stores to Sheikh Hasan when it was hit and disabled again. Two reserve tanks were ordered forward carrying engineers' storesincluding sandbags which were set on fire by hostile fire.|$|E

5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{was first}} isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) {{by the use}} of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile. Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium's extreme reactivity. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different. Later that year, the first pieces of pure molten sodium metal <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> prepared by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of molten caustic soda (now called sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with their}} attack at Ka-san, UN and North Korean units <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> deadlocked a short {{distance}} away in the Battle of Tabu-dong. In that sector, NK Major Kim Song Jun of the NK 19th Regiment, NK 13th Division had defected to the UN troops on September 1. He reported that a full-scale North Korean attack was to begin at dusk that day. The NK 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of them without weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men. Upon receiving this intelligence, 1st Cavalry Division commander Major General Hobart R. Gay alerted all of his division's front-line units to be prepared for the attack. ROK 1st Division commander Major General Paik Sun Yup also braced his men for attack.|$|E
5|$|Sphenodon guntheri {{is present}} {{naturally}} on one small island {{with a population}} of approximately 400. In 1995, 50juvenile and 18adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait, and their establishment monitored. Two years later, {{more than half of the}} animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight. In 1998, 34juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild-caught adults <b>were</b> <b>similarly</b> transferred to Matiu/Somes Island, a more publicly accessible location within Wellington Harbour. The captive juveniles were from induced layings from wild females.|$|E
