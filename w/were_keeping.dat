5|$|Altrincham {{became a}} Free Borough, a self-governing township, {{when it was}} granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de MasseyV. The charter allowed for the {{creation}} of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.|$|E

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> these lekking males alive.|$|E

5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
5|$|The tactics {{were also}} {{unsuitable}} for fighter-versus-fighter combat. Packed in tight formation, the RAF pilots {{were more concerned}} with keeping their position and not colliding with each other than they <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> watch for the enemy. It made them vulnerable to surprise attacks by Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Even if the British fighters reached the bombers without interception, the chaos of modern aerial combat {{made it impossible to}} concentrate attacks with large, rigid formations. Pilots were also forced into paying far too much respect to the bomber's defensive capabilities. Attacks were broken off far too early and caused little damage to bombers. These tactical failures were evident during the battles in Belgium and France. Moreover, rushed training with pilots who were barely able to use the old tactical methods meant that airmen could not cope with much needed radical changes.|$|E

According to Constantine VII, Christianization of Croats began in the 7th century, but the claim is disputed and is generally associated with the 9th century. Croats had first contact with the Holy See in year 641 when the papal envoy Abbot Martin came to {{them in order to}} redeem Christian captives and the bones of the martyrs that Croats <b>were</b> <b>keeping,</b> as well as to evangelize the Croats, and to turn them from paganism.|$|E
25|$|There {{was little}} {{improvement}} in 1964–65, with a finishing position of seventeenth. There was a mid-season period where the team went fifteen games without victory, including eight consecutive defeats, which equalled the club record set in 1898–99. Charnley {{returned to the}} top of the goalscoring charts, with 21 strikes, but already the bigger clubs <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> a very close eye on Alan Ball. Newcomers included Ian Moir and Jimmy Robson, but Roy Gratrix left the club after eleven years of service, and goalkeeper Gordon West joined Everton. Blackpool's debut on Match of the Day occurred with their visit to Craven Cottage to face Fulham on 21 November 1964. The match finished 3-3, with the visitors' Alan Ball netting a hat-trick.|$|E
25|$|According to the anti-religious press, priests would wander from {{village to}} village surreptitiously {{performing}} religious {{services in the}} homes of believers, while being disguised as wandering repairmen, or some other profession. It also claimed the young people were being attracted to Christianity by clergy who hired themselves out free of charge to youth parties as games organizers, musicians, choir directors, readers of secular Russian literature, drama-circle directors, etc. It also claimed that many believers <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> themselves away from churches and priests due to shame of observing religious ritual overtly, and that in response to this many priests performed religious rituals in absentia; this meant that marriage ceremonies were performed over rings that were then sent to absent bride and groom, or that funeral services were performed over empty coffins in which the corpse was later laid in a secular funeral.|$|E

25|$|He succeeded M. J. K. Smith, {{to whom he}} was unrelated, as county {{captain of}} Warwickshire in 1965, {{retaining}} the post until his retirement {{at the end of}} the 1974 season. Against Essex in 1965 he achieved the very rare feat of taking a hat-trick as bowler in a first-class match in which he had been selected as a wicket-keeper. As the West Indian wicket-keeper Deryck Murray played for Warwickshire from 1972 onwards, Smith was seldom required to keep, and was hence able to bowl increasingly regularly towards the end of his career; in 1972 he took 5–47 against Glamorgan and 5–19 in a 40-over match against Northants. On one occasion, Smith was a member of a Warwickshire team which boasted three international wicket-keepers, none of whom <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> wicket: Deryck Murray was injured, Rohan Kanhai had given up keeping, and Smith had been selected for his bowling, leaving occasional wicket-keeper John Jameson behind the stumps.|$|E
25|$|Fascists {{promoted}} {{social welfare}} to ameliorate economic conditions affecting their nation or {{race as a}} whole, {{but they did not}} support social welfare for egalitarian reasons towards those not considered racially embodied with pure German blood. Under an extensive welfare system, over 17 million Germans obtain assistance under the control of National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, an agency that had “projected a powerful image of caring and support”. The NSV had grown to the second largest Nazi group organization by 1939, dwarfed only by the German Labor Front. The NSV and its Winter Aid and Strength Through Joy provided evidence to the German citizenry that the National Socialists <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> their promise to create “an organic national community” where “class conflict and social antagonisms would be overcome” and the “egoism of the individual” would instead surrender to the “overriding interests of the whole”. These programs were designed to “obliterate distinctions of class and status” and enhance the lives of the ordinary people. Fascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak and they instead promoted social Darwinist views.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, a new {{generation}} of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's New World Pictures, Cannon Films, New Line Cinema, Film Ventures International, Fanfare Films, and Independent-International Pictures brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes. The B's <b>were</b> <b>keeping</b> pace: In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes, with a range between 69 and 79. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World, including an Italian horror film that he purchased for around $25,000: the average length was 89.8 minutes, with a range between 86 and 94. These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie Angels Die Hard, cost $117,000 to produce. It was no Easy Rider, but its box-office take of $2 million–plus meant a 46 percent return for New World's investors.|$|E
