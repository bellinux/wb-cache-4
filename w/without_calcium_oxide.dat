40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the chemical composition and the fermentative parameters of heart of palm waste produced from Alexander Palm, ensiled with chemical additives. Treatments consisted of silage of the sheath with or <b>without</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide.</b> In the silage <b>without</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide,</b> we evaluated the control silage (without additive) and the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 urea (urea). In the silage with calcium oxide, we evaluated the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 calcium oxide (control) and the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 urea and 5. 0 g kg− 1 calcium oxide (urea). Experimental silos were distributed in a completely randomized design in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (inclusion or lack of lime × inclusion or lack of urea), with four replicates. Crude protein concentration was greater in the silages that received urea, whereas in the case of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, the lowest levels were found in the control silage. Control silage had the lowest pH (3. 75) and the silages that received lime displayed the lowest lactic acid content. Effluent losses were greater in the control silage and in the silage with lime (56. 1 kg t− 1 and 58. 4 kg t− 1, respectively). Silages prepared with waste from heart of palm production and enriched only with urea showed a better chemical composition and improved fermentation parameter estimates. We recommend the use of this waste only with additives that can improve the chemical characteristics of the forage. Without additives, unwanted fermentation processes may occur and compromise the quality of the silage...|$|E
40|$|It was {{evaluated}} intake, total apparent digestibility, performance and feeding behavior of bovine fed diets constituted of corn silage, crushed sugar cane given fresh or crushed and given 72 hours after storage, ensilaged sugar cane {{with or without}} 1 % of calcium oxide and concentrate at the proportion of 1 % of the body weight. It was used 35 bovines, distributed in a random block design, with 5 treatments and 6 repetitions. The animals were housed in collective stalls with troughs individualized by electronic gates. The animals fed diet with corn silage presented greater intake of all nutrients and greater total digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber and total digestible nutrients, as well as greater weight gain and subcutaneous fat thickness. Animals fed diet with fresh sugar cane presented greater nutrient intake as well as better dry matter digestibility, ether extract and TDN content and a superior performance in relation to animals fed ensilaged sugar cane diets. Animals fed silage of sugar cane with calcium oxide presented greater digestibility of organic matter, NFC and content of TDN {{but they did not}} differ on performance in relation to the use of silage of sugar cane <b>without</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Intake and performance of animals did not change with or without storage of sugar cane.

A new concept, “Plus <b>Calcium</b> <b>Oxide</b> Grade”, was put forward, {{which is}} the very mass {{percentage}} of iron element when <b>Calcium</b> <b>Oxide</b> addition fulfills the need of the basicity of the blast furnace slag. The “Plus <b>Calcium</b> <b>Oxide</b> Grade ” and “Minus <b>Calcium</b> <b>Oxide</b> Grade ” of iron ore, iron concentrate, sinter and pellet was calculated, analyzed and also compared.

A design with five levels of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> and three replications was used. All the variables were influenced {{by the addition of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> in the silages, except the composition in acid detergent insoluble protein, water soluble carbohydrates and lignin. The dry matter content and pH linearly increased while the contents of organic matter, hemicellulose and crude protein linearly decreased with the levels of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Neutral detergent fiber corrected for ashes and protein and acid detergent fiber were adjusted for the quadratic models with calculated minimal values of 33. 3 and 22. 5 % for the levels 1. 73 and 1. 49 % of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide,</b> respectively.
