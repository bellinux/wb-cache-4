500|$|At the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won {{the award}} for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the {{audience}} {{that he had been}} thinking about [...] "a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson", and suggested that they Google his name. Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I have a friend who says the world doesn't need another angry dwarf." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon {{recorded}} his lines {{in a separate}} recording studio {{than most of the}} album. Vernon described the studio as a [...] "tiny black room". He would record a line in the room, and then shortly later West would come in and play back what was recorded, and then discuss what needed to be changed. They repeated that process a few times until the song was finished. Vernon expressed a positive opinion of working with West, and though he called West demanding in some ways, he appreciated West's enthusiasm for music and the creativity produced by the recording sessions. The song was recorded around the death of Michael Jackson and the event had an effect of the recording crew of the song, and certain aspects of the song are influences by personal events that affected West throughout the years. In an interview with MTV, West said that the song was going to be last featured on the album, and commented that [...] "emotionally it just fit the crescendo of everything that I was saying and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to this girl. And it's also my favorite eight bars that I've ever written in my life. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing." ...|$|E

As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with an Australian newspaper, Rev. Dr. Thomas Lane Butts said Lee now {{lived in an}} assisted-living facility, wheelchair-bound, partially blind and deaf, and suffering from memory loss. Butts also shared that Lee told him why she never wrote again: [...] "Two reasons: one, I wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity I went through with To Kill a Mockingbird for any amount of money. Second, I have said <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and I will not say it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with New York magazine, Hersh regretted that [...] "I actually didn't quite say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> correctly. ...

2500|$|Music for People in Trouble {{represents}} {{a departure from}} the synth-heavy, [...] "disco-infused prog" [...] Ten Love Songs (2015), with a stripped back focus on Sundfør's [...] "high, plangent" [...] voice and acoustic guitar and piano. Sundfør explained this by being [...] "tired of technology": [...] "I wanted to feel like I was a musician again. But also, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> needed something organic to convey it." [...] She called the album a return to her roots, whereas Ten Love Songs was [...] "more of a detour." [...] Throughout the album, Sundfør's vocals are mostly accompanied only by piano or guitar, with occasional usage of samples and electronic textures which [...] "take the songs into experimental territory," [...] such as [...] "trickling water sounds, wiry bleeps and animal peeps," [...] inspired by Sundfør's travels from North Korea to the Amazon rainforest. Sundfør stated she wanted to [...] "try and mix up some innocent romantic sounds with something very industrial and dry sounds." [...] The album has been described as Sundfør's most personal, affecting and poignant record yet.|$|E
