500|$|Tamworth started 2009–10 in good form, and by late September 2009 were {{occupying a}} {{play-off}} {{spot in the}} Conference Premier. Mills' team eventually finished in 16th place in a season of consolidation; this represented the second highest league placing in the club's history. He made the last appearance of his career aged 48 after starting Tamworth's 4–3 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United on 24 April 2010, before substituting himself for Des Lyttle in the 55th minute. This was his third appearance of the season. In the Conference Premier, Tamworth were playing against a number of clubs with Football League pedigrees, meaning {{they were not able}} to offer contracts as lucrative or long as many clubs. Mills complemented the competitiveness of his team in this division, saying: [...] "For a small club like us, it's great to be mixing with these teams. But, while we may be smaller, like last year, we <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> we are capable of getting results." [...] Tamworth had a strong start in 2010–11; they were again in a play-off position by late September 2010, and by the time Mills had left the club they were 12th in the Conference Premier.|$|E

We will take every step necessary to protect our parishioners and staff as well as members of the community, in coordination with the local authorities." [...] The statement also referred to the actions of members of Project Chanology as [...] "hate crimes" [...] and [...] "religious bigotry", and in a media release said that the group is guided by Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf; one of the organizers of the protest responded to the latter allegation by stating: [...] "I don't know where they got that from, but I don't think that's true considering that I am a capitalist and a Jew". Pat Harney, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "We are dealing with a worldwide threat ... This is not a light matter." [...] In preparation for the February 10, 2008 protests outside Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, the Church of Scientology spent $4,500 to hire ten off-duty police officers for security. Clearwater Police Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Daly-Watts stated that the off-duty police officers <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> protesters do not trespass on Scientology property or violate the law, but will report to police supervisors and not representatives of the Church of Scientology.|$|E
