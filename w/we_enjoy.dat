25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom <b>we</b> <b>enjoy,</b> the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E

We have a terrific crew. But at the same time, I'm looking forward to what's next. It's exciting to know that something unknown is next." [...] The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and Chakotay. Ryan found this confusing for the characters, as although it had been suggested in the episode [...] "", the producers told the pair to forget about the relationship in the in-between episodes until the finale.|$|E

A brook went with us part of the way, singing to us through the dark--a gay, irresponsible {{vagabond}} of valley and wilderness.|$|R
500|$|A {{streaming}} free {{live performance}} was hosted by iTunes on 9 February 2012. McCartney performed live from Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, {{where much of}} the album was recorded. People tuned into the show by accessing iTunes on their PCs or Macintosh computers. The live performance was later released, as Paul McCartney's Live Kisses, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, airing on PBS' Great Performances in September 2012. The performance was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 13 November 2012. In an interview with Billboard, McCartney said that he didn't rule out the possibility of a tour of the album with the musicians who played on it: [...] "We haven't really talked about it yet. People have plenty of ideas and suggestions. I'd like to see how it goes live, just how much <b>we</b> <b>enjoy</b> it. If we all enjoy it, then we've got to think about taking it out." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011 Soundgarden {{announced}} on their homepage {{that they had}} started recording a new album. On March 1, 2011, Chris Cornell confirmed that Adam Kasper would produce it. Four days later, the band stated it would consist of material that was [...] "90 percent new" [...] with the rest consisting of updated versions of older ideas. They also noted that they had 12 to 14 songs that were [...] "kind of ready to go". Although Cameron claimed the album would be released in 2011, the recording was prolonged as Thayil said that [...] "the more <b>we</b> <b>enjoy</b> it, the more our fans should end up enjoying it". Thayil also reported that some songs sound [...] "similar in a sense to Down on the Upside" [...] and that the album would be [...] "picking up where we left off. There are some heavy moments, {{and there are some}} fast songs." [...] The next day, Cornell reported that the new album would not be released until the spring of 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "Silly Love Songs" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, [...] "This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though <b>we</b> <b>enjoy</b> over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show’s fans about all the things we’ve missed about the show these last couple of months." ...|$|E

It was {{something}} we were doing because <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> each other’s company and <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the music but it wasn't like the new album of either band. It didn't have that urgency to it. Also, I think the music, the pacing and the feeling of the music itself kind of suggests that too.|$|R
500|$|Grossmith {{had become}} the most popular solo {{entertainer}} of his day, and his tours earned him far {{more than he had}} earned while performing with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. He also continued to compose music, including the comic opera Castle Bang (1894) and the sketches The Ibsenite Drama (1895) and Do <b>We</b> <b>Enjoy</b> Our Holidays? (1897) and songs like [...] "The Baby on the Shore" [...] (1893), [...] "Johnnie at the Gaiety" [...] (1895), [...] "Tommy's First Love" [...] (1897), and [...] "The Happy Old Days at Peckham" [...] (1903). In 1894–95, however, Gilbert enticed Grossmith to take the role of George Griffenfeld in His Excellency, with music by Frank Osmond Carr. [...] Also in 1897, he played briefly as King Ferdinand V of Vingolia in F. C. Burnand's His Majesty at the Savoy Theatre and made two more short London stage appearances thereafter, as Scoones in Young Mr Yarde (1898) and Lambert Simnel in The Gay Pretenders (1900). An 1896 interview of Grossmith reveals him feeling his age and considering the end of his touring career, while enjoying time spent at home with his family, dogs and antique piano collection. Grossmith suffered from depression {{after the death of his}} wife of cancer in 1905, and his health began to fail, so that he increasingly missed engagements. [...] He was nevertheless persuaded to continue giving his entertainments, which he did on a less frequent basis, until November 1908. The following year, Grossmith retired to Folkestone, Kent, a town that he had visited for many years, where he wrote his second volume of reminiscences, Piano and I (1910).|$|E

From late 2009 Littlemore worked in Montreal, Canada with the Cirque Du Soleil as a composer and musical {{director for the}} touring arena show, Zarkana, which debuted on 29 June 2011 in New York. Pnau's fourth album, Soft Universe, was recorded in London. Upon its release Mayes confirmed Littlemore and Steele were working on a second Empire of the Sun album. Littlemore expanded, [...] "We just started writing {{two or three weeks}} ago in New York ... Luke and I got into a studio, which was run by blind people – it was great. It's good to be in weird places with Luke, <b>we</b> <b>enjoy</b> that. He has an extraordinary mind – it's sounding so good". As from July 2011, when not touring or performing, he lives in LA.

2500|$|In 2010, Fellowes hired Alastair Bruce, {{an expert}} on state and court ritual, as {{historical}} adviser. Bruce explains his role as being [...] "here to guide the production and particularly the director as they bring Julian's words to life. That also involves getting the social conduct right, and giving actors a sense of surety {{in the way they}} deliver a performance." [...] Actor Jim Carter, who plays butler Carson, describes Bruce as the series [...] "etiquette watchdog", and the UK's Daily Telegraph finished its 2011 profile of Bruce's role stating [...] "Downton's authenticity, it seems, is in safe hands." [...] However, historian Simon Schama criticised the show for historical inaccuracies and [...] "pandering to clichés". Producer Gareth Neame defended the show, saying, [...] "Downton is a fictional drama. It is not a history programme, but a drama of social satire about a time when relationships, behaviour and hierarchy were very different from those <b>we</b> <b>enjoy</b> today." ...|$|E

We belong both of us to a home-loving stock, and the peace and prosperity of every home in the land is at stake. On our action now depends the question whether our children shall curse or bless us; whether we shall live in their memory as promoters of civil strife, with all its miserable consequences, or as joint architects of a happy, prosperous, and united state.
