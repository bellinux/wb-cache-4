5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 {{episode of}} Xplosion, when she {{interfered}} and helped Wilde defeat Daffney {{to end the}} team's long losing streak. The following week, when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained {{that she did not}} want to win by cheating, Sarita claimed that she was a winner and, unlike Wilde, did not need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she had lost her match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne, proclaiming she <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> losing matches. Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by putting her feet on the ropes for leverage. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. At the July 26 tapings of Impact!, Stock tore her triceps and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. She returned at the September 6 tapings of Xplosion, defeating Daffney.|$|E
25|$|On the April 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown, {{tension between the}} team rose when McCool refused to tag Layla into a match against Kelly and Phoenix. Layla {{continued}} trying to fix their relationship, but McCool was resistant. Tension was further highlighted in a SmackDown scene where the two were seen undergoing couples therapy. When Layla lost a singles match against Kelly despite McCool's attempts to help her, McCool told Layla she <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> doing all her work for her, and shoved her over. Finally, On the April 22 episode of SmackDown, McCool turned on Layla by attacking her after the therapy session, thereby disbanding LayCool. During the 2011 WWE Draft, McCool cost Layla a match against Eve Torres. After the match, McCool tried to taunt and bully Layla again, however Layla snapped after all her efforts at trying to keep LayCool together, and viciously attacked McCool, saying she <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> her, before throwing her at the announce table, thus turning face in the process. On the April 29 episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool fought to a no contest. After the match, Layla challenged McCool to a No Count Out, No Disqualification match at Extreme Rules. McCool accepted on one condition that the loser leaves WWE. On May 1 at Extreme Rules 2011, Layla defeated McCool which meant {{she had to leave}} WWE. After the match, a debuting Kharma came out and attacked McCool with the Implant Buster. Layla retired on July 29, 2015.|$|E

Their feud culminated at WrestleMania 32, where Jericho defeated Styles. However, on the April 4 episode of Raw, Jericho competed in a fatal-four way match against Styles, Kevin Owens and Cesaro to determine the No. 1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort after being pinned by Styles, ending their feud.|$|E
500|$|Although Dodd {{obtained}} {{small parts}} in several television series, {{for many years}} {{he and his fellow}} Aboriginal actors found themselves included in only minor and typecast roles in television productions. According to Indigenous actor, historian and activist Gary Foley, Dodd joked that [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> roles where his total dialogue was, 'he went that way, Boss!'" [...] Reflecting on this issue, a commentator remarked on the 1978 film Little Boy Lost: [...] "There are many irrelevant scenes, the most obvious one being where Tracker Bindi (Steve Dodd), an Aboriginal, is introduced– yet another tired reinforcement of a false stereotype." ...|$|E

Richard has commented, [...] "although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever...

500|$|Wolpaw {{said that}} while many story {{elements}} of Portal are revisited in Portal 2, he avoided some of the memes—such as the frequently repeated [...] "the cake is a lie". He said, [...] "if {{you thought you were}} sick of the memes, I <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> it way ahead of you". Wolpaw [...] "couldn't resist putting in just one" [...] cake joke. The writers did not try to predict or write new memes, and Wolpaw said, [...] "you can't really plan for [...] because if you do it probably seems weird and forced". Portal 2 produced its own memes, including a space-obsessed personality core. Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game [...] (see below), and the Space Core also appeared as a laser-based engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{liked the}} episode {{because of its}} [...] "non-stop one liners and great guest cameos." [...] Sassone's only {{complaint}} was that the Jack, Nancy, and Avery love triangle be over, pointing out that he <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> seeing Jack running around trying to keep Avery and Nancy from seeing each other. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that [...] "we {{got one of the}} best episode titles of any show this year", and was favorable to the guest spots from Jon Hamm, Dean Winters, and Michael Sheen, observing [...] "he episode joyfully gave us three great pairings for Liz to deal with, each presenting their own unique set of laughs." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating. Linda Holmes for National Public Radio said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was [...] "very funny", and commented that her favorite scene was when Liz visited Drew in hopes that the two can get back together.|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{intended}} to attack stereotypes by portraying them directly, culling imagery from blackface iconography. Early designs {{in which the}} main characters (Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear and Preacher Fox) resembled figures from The Wind in the Willows were rejected. Bakshi juxtaposed stereotypical designs of blacks with even more negative depictions of white racists, but the film's strongest criticism is directed at the Mafia. Bakshi said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> all the hero worship these guys got because of The Godfather." [...] Production concluded in 1973. During editing, the title was changed to Coonskin No More..., and finally to Coonskin. [...] Bakshi hired several African American animators to work on Coonskin, including Brenda Banks, the first African American female animator. Bakshi also hired graffiti artists and trained them to work as animators. The film's release was delayed by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which called Bakshi and his film racist. After its distribution was contracted to the Bryanston Distributing Company, Paramount canceled a project that Bakshi and Ruddy were developing, The American Chronicles.|$|E

500|$|During the Utopia storyline, the X-Men {{leave their}} San Francisco base and {{establish}} the island [...] "Utopia" [...] for mutants on {{the remains of}} Asteroid M. [...] The anthology series [...] explores the characters' reactions to this relocation, with Anole featuring in his own story, [...] "Big Boy Pants". [...] The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X-Men how to farm their own crops, but Anole argues {{that it is a}} waste of time since they could just buy their food from a store. [...] He looks to Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him that this was not a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> looking at him. [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E
500|$|Bart Simpson {{is one of}} Krusty's biggest fans. In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E

The comic writer and actor Tony Hendra says that {{at the beginning of}} Beard's tenure, he was painfully shy but the magazine's authority over what material was used.

The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size.

This is intimated by the invitation, 'let him take the water of life freely' (Rev 22:17). And again, 'I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely' (Rev 21:6). This is spoken to the sick, to them that <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> the disease that only Christ, as a physician, with his water of life, can cure (Mark 2:17).

2500|$|On 6 October Cheney {{left the}} band {{because he felt}} burnt out, he <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> the {{constant}} touring, as well as experiencing writer's block. Cheney felt {{that he needed to}} get away from the band and develop other aspects of his life. This information was kept confidential until 2008. Early in 2007 Cheney had isolated himself from his bandmates while trying to write tracks for a follow-up to State of Emergency. He was disappointed with the results so he took up yoga, spent time painting and being around his baby daughter whilst taking a break from music for the first time in 10 years. During this period the band released a radio-only single, a cover version of Cold Chisel's [...] "Rising Sun", available on the Standing on the Outside (March 2007), a Cold Chisel tribute album by various Australian artists. After Cheney overcame his writer's block and was convinced not to leave the band, the group played The Great Escape in April 2007 and restarted work on their fifth studio album. They toured the UK in August that year, releasing State of Emergency there on 13 August through Deck Cheese Records.|$|E
