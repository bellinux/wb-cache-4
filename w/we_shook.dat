25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E
500|$|Flo & Eddie (singers Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman) {{arrived at}} the end of {{recording}} time when the band thought all the tracks were finalised. When they learned of the vocal duo's purpose, [...] "they weren't really up for it," [...] said Kaylan: the two veterans [...] "represented establishment... e literally felt like, {{for the first time as}} session guys, we were proving ourselves". In the end, however, the band members warmed to the pair, and concluded a successful session. [...] "We did the three or four cuts that Todd had brought us up to do, and <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> hands with everybody," [...] Kaylan recalled, but as they were preparing to leave, Rundgren asked them to listen to the album's planned single. After [...] "Love My Way" [...] played, Kaylan and Volman excitedly insisted that they be allowed to record some vocals for it. [...] "We have got to sing on this one," [...] Kaylan recalls thinking. [...] "If we don't sing on this one, we're not gonna sing on the hit. This is the fucking hit!" [...] The background vocals that Flo & Eddie ultimately contributed ended up being considered one of the highlights of their lengthy career.|$|E
500|$|In the 2013 {{video game}} , a prequel to the Arkham series, {{there are several}} {{references}} to The Killing Joke. When Batman enters a carnival-esque room, Joker tells him he got {{a great deal on}} an out-of-service amusement park, [...] "You should have seen the look on the real estate agent's face when <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> hands on the deal!", alluding to Joker's conning a theme park entrepreneur into granting him the rights of a run-down amusement park early in the graphic novel and then proceeding to murder him via Joker toxin. In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Joker is playable as the Red Hood, walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker, as well as earlier beating up several patrons at a Comedy Club due to very poor reception towards a joke he made. The name of the achievement for defeating the Joker in the ending of the game [...] "Perhaps sooner, perhaps later" [...] was a reference to Batman's talk with [...] "Joker" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} graphic novel. While promoting the game, Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in the game, recites a monologue from the graphic novel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 three-term US Representative Edward Gurney {{sought the}} Florida U.S. Senate seat vacated by the {{retirement}} of Democrat George Smathers. Former Governor LeRoy Collins, an ally of retiring President Lyndon B. Johnson, was the Democratic nominee. Cramer and Gurney were prospective primary opponents until Cramer yielded to Gurney. They based this on an understanding that Gurney would thereafter back Cramer for the other Senate seat, which {{was expected to be}} vacated by Spessard Holland in 1970. According to Cramer, Gurney [...] "pledged his support to me, and I did to him, and <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shamrock {{engaged in}} a feud with Don Frye during {{his career in the}} Pride Fighting Championships, whose {{background}} was Don Frye's trash talking. In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: [...] "I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, [...] "That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line. I wasn't professional about it, but Ken was and after the fight, <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> hands and went our separate ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover. She had {{initially}} {{tried to get a}} picture with just Lennon alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and {{he looked like he was}} clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I looked him in the eye and <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|E
2500|$|Warrior {{had been}} largely alienated from his peers in {{professional}} wrestling in the decade before his death, and was sometimes described as a bitter man on bad terms with various wrestling figures such as Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts. With Warrior's reconciling with the professional wrestling industry just before his death, some of his former adversaries offered their condolences. McMahon stated that [...] "We are all so sad that the Ultimate Warrior has passed away. Our heart is with his wife Dana and his two daughters." [...] Hogan said, [...] "RIP WARRIOR. only love ... We talked, both forgave each other, we hugged, <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> hands as we told each other I love you, I am so sad, God bless his beautiful family". Roberts {{said that he was}} [...] "Deeply saddened. We just had a great talk & buried a senseless hatchet. Talked working together. RIP Warrior. Taking solace we made peace." [...] News of his death spread the next day on sites such as Bing, Facebook, and Twitter. It was also mentioned on ABC News, HLN and CNN. Reportedly almost immediately after Warrior's death, WWE sent two senior officials to Arizona to assist his widow in handling personal things such as grocery shopping so that she can focus on being with her and Warrior's daughters.|$|E

2500|$|Jobs {{told his}} {{official}} biographer that after meeting Simpson, {{he wanted to}} become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When Jandali was found working in Sacramento, Jobs decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching to join the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that [...] "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." [...] (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs). Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that [...] "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy, and a big tipper." [...] After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that [...] "it was amazing... I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. <b>We</b> <b>shook</b> hands." [...] However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because [...] "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it... I asked Mona not to tell him about me." [...] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked [...] "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" [...] Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, [...] "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive... he never contacted Steve." [...] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father. She would also create a fictional portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, A Regular Guy.|$|E

[...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself.
