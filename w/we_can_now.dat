25|$|Every recursively defined {{function}} {{can be seen}} as a {{fixed point}} of some suitably defined function closing over the recursive call with an extra argument, and therefore, using Y, every recursively defined function can be expressed as a lambda expression. In particular, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication and comparison predicate of natural numbers recursively.|$|E

25|$|The Disquisitiones was the {{starting}} point for the work of other nineteenth century European mathematicians including Ernst Kummer, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Richard Dedekind. Many of the annotations given by Gauss are in effect announcements of further research of his own, some of which remained unpublished. They must have appeared particularly cryptic to his contemporaries; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> read them as containing the germs of the theories of L-functions and complex multiplication, in particular.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} reduce {{everything}} to simple fundamental laws {{does not imply}} the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> see that the whole becomes not merely more, but {{very different from the}} sum of its parts.|$|E
25|$|An {{obvious way}} {{to extend the}} {{context-free}} grammar formalism is to allow nonterminals to have arguments, the values of which are passed along within the rules. This allows natural language features such as agreement and reference, and programming language analogs such as the correct use and definition of identifiers, to be expressed in a natural way. E.g. <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> easily express that in English sentences, the subject and verb must agree in number. In computer science, examples of this approach include affix grammars, attribute grammars, indexed grammars, and Van Wijngaarden two-level grammars. Similar extensions exist in linguistics.|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> give a {{complete}} description of w = z½. To do {{so we need}} two copies of the z-plane, each of them cut along the real axis. On one copy we define the square root of 1 to be e0 = 1, {{and on the other}} we define the square root of 1 to be e'iπ = 1. We call these two copies of the complete cut plane sheets. By making a continuity argument we see that the (now single-valued) function w = z½ maps the first sheet into the upper half of the w-plane, where 0 ≤ arg(w) < π, while mapping the second sheet into {{the lower half of the}} w-plane (where π ≤ arg(w) < 2π).|$|E
25|$|The term MODY {{dates back}} to 1964, when {{diabetes}} mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to {{what we now call}} type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic hyperglycemia without progression to diabetic ketosis or ketoacidosis. In retrospect <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success.|$|E

500|$|In September 2007 Clark's memoir A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country.

He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that [...] "...we did learn one thing that’s very important. With the end of the Cold War, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> use our military with impunity. The Soviets won’t come in to block us.
