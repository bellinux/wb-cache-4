5|$|City's season {{opened with}} a 0–0 draw at home to Liverpool. City were awarded a penalty, but new captain Tony Book hit it wide. Two defeats followed, at Southampton and Stoke. The Stoke defeat led to a {{tactical}} switch. Mike Summerbee, who played <b>wide</b> <b>on</b> the right {{at the start of}} the season, was moved to centre-forward. The change reaped immediate dividends, with Summerbee playing a leading role in a 4–2 win against Southampton. This was the first in a run of five straight wins, after which Manchester City had caught up with the league leaders. During this run of wins young winger Stan Bowles made his league debut, scoring twice in a 5–2 win against Sheffield United.|$|E

5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards <b>wide,</b> <b>on</b> the other side of Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards <b>wide.</b> <b>On</b> October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E
5|$|Fisichella {{spun off}} from seventh place on lap eight, losing eight {{positions}} and Irvine moved into Fisichella's former position. Alesi pitted on lap ninth and re-emerged {{at the rear}} of the field after repairs to his car's steering. Villeneuve passed de la Rosa for 21st position. Two laps later, Alesi drove to his garage and became the first retirement of the race. Fisichella ran <b>wide</b> <b>on</b> lap 12 and was passed by Herbert for 13th. Three laps later, Fisichella made his first pit stop for repairs to his car's brakes and came out in 19th position. Häkkinen's lead over Michael Schumacher was seven seconds by lap 19. Coulthard was a further three seconds behind the Michael Schumacher and was drawing ahead from Ralf Schumacher. Villeneuve moved into 18th position after passing Fisichella and Zonta by lap 20. Heidfeld became the race's second retirement when he stalled after making the first scheduled pit stop on lap 22. Two laps later, Irvine, who had been running seventh, made his first pit stop and dropped to 11th.|$|E

5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) <b>wide.</b> <b>On</b> it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. World champion Lewis Hamilton took a clean sweep and topped the time sheets {{in all three}} sessions by a considerable margin. The first session saw Lotus test driver Jolyon Palmer participate in place of regular Romain Grosjean. He finished six-tenths of a second behind his teammate Pastor Maldonado {{and was one of}} several drivers to have off track experiences during the session. Both Mercedes drivers ran <b>wide</b> <b>on</b> different parts of the track, as did Felipe Massa, who spun his Williams in turn 14 {{towards the end of the}} session. Hamilton was over half a second clear of his teammate Nico Rosberg on Friday morning, with the Ferraris more than a second behind.|$|E

5|$|The Union {{increased}} its pace with Andrew Wenger playing <b>wide</b> <b>on</b> the left where he repeatedly got past Yedlin {{to get to}} the byline or cut back to shoot. Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia's position by combining {{on the other side of}} the field to penetrate Seattle's defense. Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot, but Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei was quick enough to make the stop. In the 38th minute, Maidana was fouled by Leonardo González wide right of the penalty area. Maidana's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where Brad Evans lost his footing and Edu glanced the ball with his forehead to put it in the back of the net. The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Prost paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Félix da Costa in second, and Lopez third. D'Ambrosio and Ma Qinghua (who was unable to {{complete}} a maximum power lap) were the group's two slowest drivers. Buemi was the fastest driver in the second group, half a second ahead of teammate Turvey. Heidfeld, Sarazzin, and Evans rounded out the top five. In the third group, Vergne recorded the overall fastest time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 20.993 seconds. Di Grassi qualified 12th overall after narrowly avoiding colliding with the wall between the sixth and seventh turns. His teammate Abt was second quickest in the group, ahead of di Grassi, Maro Engel, and Duval (who went <b>wide</b> <b>on</b> his timed lap which was recorded on reduced power). Rosenqvist immediately employed his car's full power capacity and was the fastest driver in the fourth (and last) group. He finished ahead of Bird, who equalled Vergne's pace at first, but then his rear tyre made contact with the wall which cost him time. Piquet was third on his fastest lap which saw him make contact with the wall once. Robin Frijns and Adam Carroll were the slowest drivers of the fourth group; the latter locked his rear tyres and went wide at the first corner, resulting in him starting 20th (and last). At the end of the group qualifying stage, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Buemi, Bird and Piquet were the five drivers to qualify for the Super Pole round.|$|E
5|$|On lap 34, both Hamilton and Vettel came in {{for their}} second and final planned stop, both {{equipping}} the medium tyre set. The undercut worked once more for the Ferrari, as Rosberg emerged behind Vettel one lap later. However, Vettel ran <b>wide</b> <b>on</b> the exit of the final corner on lap 36, letting Rosberg past and damaging his front wing, meaning {{he had to come}} into the pit lane for an unscheduled stop on the next lap, leaving him down in fifth position. His teammate Räikkönen made a second pit stop on lap 40, taking the softer and faster tyres, trying to catch the two Mercedes {{towards the end of the}} race. Fourteen laps before the finish, Räikkönen was fifteen seconds down on second-placed Rosberg, but closing by more than a second per lap. With the Mercedes in front having to make their way through backmarkers, Räikkönen was able to cut down the gap even faster, reaching Rosberg with three laps of the race to go. Rosberg, suffering from brake overheating over the entire course of the race, outbraked himself at turn one on lap 56, which allowed Räikkönen to take second place from him. The other Mercedes of Hamilton had brake problems as well towards the end, but was able to control the gap to the Ferrari to take his third victory of the season.|$|E
