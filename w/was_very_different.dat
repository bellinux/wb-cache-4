5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula {{was surrounded by a}} fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.|$|E
5|$|The American s {{were the}} first all-big-gun ships {{completed}} {{by one of the}} United Kingdom's rivals. The planning for the type had begun before Dreadnought was launched. There is some speculation the US Navy design was influenced by informal contacts with sympathetic Royal Navy officials, but the American ship <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Orangi Pilot Project <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{from the}} Comilla Academy. OPP {{was a private}} body, {{dependent}} for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources {{and support of the}} government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.|$|E
50|$|In the Spring of 2003, Matthews and Reynolds {{embarked}} on another successful solo acoustic tour. The shows <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{from the normal}} DMB shows in that the venues were usually more intimate, and the song selection <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b>|$|R
50|$|The enclosing-ball/cube-slimness might <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{from the}} enclosed-ball/cube-slimness.|$|R
5000|$|Jim O’Neill, the {{chairman}} of Goldman Sachs Asset Management International {{and the person who}} coined the term BRIC, said that the countries [...] "don’t have the same interests. The wealth per head <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different,</b> the politics <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different,</b> and the philosophy and their natural economic edge is different." ...|$|R
5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, {{wondering}} if {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and {{was shocked by the}} news of a military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{positions}} have similar names but in practice <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> A fullback in American football <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from a fullback in rugby league. However, some of {{the positions}} are fairly similar: for instance, the stand-off/five-eighth and halfback carry out a similar role to a quarterback in American football.|$|R
50|$|The {{treatment}} {{needed for}} {{different types of}} floors <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b>|$|R
5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that walked on the sea-floor, Marella <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) {{in the structure of}} its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|The {{major league}} {{game in the}} United States was {{originally}} targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E

40|$|We {{call our}} {{thoughts}} conscious, {{and we also}} say the same of our bodily sensations, perceptions and other sensory experiences. But thoughts and sensory experiences <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> phenomena, both {{from the point of}} view of their subject and in their functional or cognitive role. Does this mean, then, that there <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> kind...|$|R
50|$|In {{some simple}} {{standard}} cases, the intervals produced as confidence and credible intervals {{from the same}} data set can be identical. They <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> if informative prior information {{is included in the}} Bayesian analysis, and may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> for some parts of the space of possible data even if the Bayesian prior is relatively uninformative.|$|R
5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
5|$|The reality <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> Lody's {{body was}} buried in an unmarked common grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow along with {{seventeen}} other men– ten executed spies and seven prisoners who died of ill-health or accidents. It was not until 1924 that the grave received a marker, at the instigation of the German Embassy. Lody's relatives were visiting it once a year and enquired whether his body could be exhumed and buried in a private grave. The War Office agreed, providing that the body could be identified, but the Foreign Office was more reluctant and pointed out that a licence for exhumation {{would have to be}} authorised by the Home Office. The Lody family placed a white headstone and kerb on the grave some time around 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{season begins}} with Rowan {{attempting}} to fix Olivia's {{personal life and}} Olivia teaming with Mellie and Fitz for {{a press conference to}} reveal the truth about her and Fitz. Olivia and Rowan disagree about the purpose of B613, which Rowan currently heads. Olivia has an emotional history with Huck. She teams with Jake and Huck to expose Operation Remington. Olivia's mother, Maya Lewis (Khandi Alexander), is introduced both in the present day and in flashbacks. Olivia comes to believe that her father had made the decision to kill her mother, which <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> than her prior beliefs about her mother's death. Believing that her father and Fitz conspired to shoot down a plane with her mother on board, Olivia becomes the client of her own firm. It is later revealed that her mother is alive and has been held prisoner by her father in a maximum security prison for 20 years for national security reasons. Lewis escapes. The midseason hiatus from mid-December to late-February left off with Olivia sending her mother abroad. However, Olivia realizes that her mother is a terrorist who married her father for his access to high level intelligence.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} of the Jews in Denmark <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from Norway. Far fewer Danish Jews were arrested and deported, {{and those who were}} deported were sent to Theresienstadt, rather than Auschwitz, where a relatively large percentage survived.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Southern Italy, Brigandage was {{generally}} {{little in the}} other annexed states of northern and central Italy like: Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, Duchy of Parma, Duchy of Modena, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Papal States, because the situation of Southern Italy <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different,</b> owing to the previous centuries of history.|$|E
25|$|The band's next album, All Will Be Revealed (the title {{apparently}} {{referring to}} Sean Harris), {{was released in}} 2005 and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from their early material. To promote this album they toured with Megadeth. Brian Tatler commented that {{this was one of}} the best experiences of his life and regained his enjoyment playing live with the band again.|$|E

25|$|The case <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> with indulgences for the dead. As regards these {{there is}} no doubt that Tetzel did, {{according}} to what he considered his authoritative instructions, proclaim as Christian doctrine that nothing but an offering of money was required to gain the indulgence for the dead, without there being any question of contrition or confession.|$|E
25|$|Between 1880 and 1922, the British {{administration}} consolidated {{their position}} {{over a large}} area of the Naga Hills and integrated it into its Assam operations. The British administration enforced the rupee as the currency for economic activity and a system of structured tribal government that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> than historic social governance practices. These developments triggered profound social changes among the Naga people.|$|E
25|$|From 1920 to 1955 only AFL-affiliated unions were {{represented}} by the SCLC. During this phase there was a considerable conservative influence from Dave Beck, a prominent Teamster on the West Coast and eventual President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). Although he was instrumental in rebuilding the strength of organized labor in Seattle, his conservative business unionism approach <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from the Council’s previous radical ideologies.|$|E
