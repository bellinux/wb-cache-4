The attachment of a small mass to a vibrating cantilever produces a resonance frequency shift that can be monitored, providing the ability to measure mass changes down to a few molecules resolution. Nevertheless, the lack of a practical method to handle the catch and release process required for dynamic weighting of microobjects strongly hindered the application of the technology beyond proof of concept measurements. Here, a method is proposed in which FluidFM hollow cantilevers are exploited to overcome the standard limitations of AFM-based mass sensors, providing high throughput single object weighting with picogram accuracy.

50|$|As {{specific}} gravity {{was the basis}} for the Balling, Brix and Plato tables, dissolved sugar content was originally estimated by measurement of {{specific gravity}} using a hydrometer or pycnometer. In modern times, hydrometers are still widely used, but where greater accuracy is required, an electronic oscillating U-tube meter may be employed. Whichever means are used, the analyst enters the tables with specific gravity and takes out (using interpolation if necessary) the sugar content in percent by mass. If the analyst uses the Plato tables (maintained by the American Society of Brewing Chemists) he or she reports in °P. If using the Brix table (the current version of which is maintained by NIST and can be found on their website), he or she reports in °Bx. If using the ICUMSA tables, he or she would report in mass fraction (m.f.). It is not, typically, actually necessary to consult tables as the tabulated °Bx or °P value can be printed directly on the hydrometer scale next to the tabulated value of specific gravity or stored in the memory of the electronic U-tube meter or calculated from polynomial fits to the tabulated data. Both ICUMSA and ASBC have published suitable polynomials; in fact, the ICUMSA tables are calculated from the polynomials. The opposite is true with the ASBC polynomial. Also note that the tables in use today are not those published by Brix or Plato. Those workers measured true specific gravity reference to water at 4 °C using, respectively, 17.5 °C and 20 °C, as the temperature at which the density of a sucrose solution be measured. Both NBS and ASBC converted to apparent specific gravity at 20 °C/20 °C.

Because egg weight changed at the same rate in air and in water, the decrease in SG can be attributed to the loss in weight.

Its specific gravity has been determined to be 1. 40 to 1. 56. But the measurements were performed without considering the adsorption of air during the operation. Now the defect is excluded by the following method and obtained new density value of the wood substance. A certain quantity of the speciemen (in the powdered state), which had been dried, was weighed, and it was put into a glass tube which had been sealed at one end, as is shown by A in Fig. 1. A part of the tube was necked with a burner several centimeters from its sealed end as is shown by B in the figure. Then the tube was connected to an oil rotary pump which was capable of evacuating down to a pressure of about 0. 01 mm of mercury. When the evacuation was ended the tube was sealed at its neck as shown in C, Fig. 1. The tube thus sealed was weighed, and then its volume was measured. Distilled water was then introduced into the tube by breaking the neck of the tube at b in distilled water in the way shown by D in Fig. 1. Next the weight of the specimen in distilled water was measured. After the weight in distilled water of the glass tube containing the specimen, and the broken neck, bbth of which were perfectly filled with water, had been measured, the glass tube was broken along the filed line a, and the specimen was taken out of the tube. Then the weight in distilled water of all the parts of the broken glass tube, as shown by E in Fig. 1, was measured in the same way, and the weight of the specimen only in distilled water was obtained immediately. Finally after all the parts of the broken glass tube had been well dried, their <b>weight</b> <b>in</b> <b>air</b> was measured. From the weight of the glass tube only and that of the sealed glass tube containing the specimen which was well evacuated, we can obtain immediately the net weight of the specimen.

The examinations consisted in the qualitative assessment of porosity by means of the optical microscopy and its quantitative determination by the method of <b>weighting</b> specimens <b>in</b> <b>air</b> and <b>in</b> water. It was found during the examination that the porosity of castings decreases with an increase in the home scrap fraction in the metal charge. The qualitative examinations confirmed the beneficial influence of the increased home scrap fraction on the porosity of castings. It was concluded that the reusing of home scrap in a foundry can be a good way of reduction of costs related to the production of pressure castings...|$|R
5000|$|To {{perform an}} axel, the skater {{typically}} approaches the jump on a right back outside edge in a strongly held check position before stepping on a left forward outside edge. He or she vaults over the toe {{pick of the}} left skate and [...] "steps up" [...] into the jump with the right leg. The skater crosses the left {{foot in front of}} the right, which is known as a back spin position (similar to the loop jump), to bring the center of rotation around the right side of the body. This act is often described as a <b>weight</b> shift <b>in</b> the <b>air.</b> Uncrossing the legs during the landing checks the rotation and allows the skater to flow out of the jump with good speed.|$|R
50|$|Air's {{density is}} very small {{compared}} to most solids and liquids. For this reason, the weight of an object <b>in</b> <b>air</b> is approximately the same as its true <b>weight</b> <b>in</b> a vacuum. The buoyancy of air is neglected for most objects during a measurement <b>in</b> <b>air</b> because the error is usually insignificant (typically less than 0.1% except for objects of very low average density such as a balloon or light foam).|$|R
