5|$|The game's {{premise is}} similar to that of the {{original}} Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic's nemesis, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, is planning <b>world</b> <b>domination</b> through the power of the Chaos Emeralds and an army of robots powered by trapped animals. Specific to this game, he is additionally constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg (a parody of the Death Star), also for the means of <b>world</b> <b>domination.</b>|$|E
5|$|After CoreFire, the world's {{greatest}} superhero, goes missing, {{the former}} members of The Champions re-unite to investigate his disappearance, bringing in two new replacement heroines, Lily and Fatale. They immediately suspect CoreFire's nemesis, Dr. Impossible, was involved, {{even though he has}} been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth <b>world</b> <b>domination</b> attempt. An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at <b>world</b> <b>domination.</b> The New Champions search for Impossible, convinced he is responsible for CoreFire's demise, while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan. This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin, as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life.|$|E

5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on <b>world</b> <b>domination</b> or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E

5|$|Tyndall also {{engaged in}} Holocaust denial, {{declaring that the}} Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to gain sympathy for {{themselves}} and thus aid their plot for <b>world</b> <b>domination.</b> In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier David Irving. In promoting Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E

25|$|Another part of {{the modern}} {{antisemitism}} in Europe was the conspiracy theory of Jewish <b>world</b> economic <b>domination</b> as presented in the antisemitic hoax The Protocols of the Elders of Zion which {{was first published in}} Russia in 1903.

5|$|Dr. Drakken (voiced by John DiMaggio): born Drew Theodore P. Lipsky, Drakken is Kim's archnemesis {{and most}} {{resilient}} adversary; a mad scientist plotting <b>world</b> <b>domination,</b> {{although most of}} his schemes fail {{at the hands of}} Kim because he lacks both the patience and intelligence to perfect his ideas, which often suffer {{as a result of his}} own mistakes and oversights.

Earth {{has never had a}} sovereign government with authority over the entire globe, although some nation-states have striven for <b>world</b> <b>domination</b> and failed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series is}} based on the concept of {{parallel}} <b>worlds,</b> <b>domination</b> over them being fought between the kingdoms at the extreme ends of Shadow—Amber, the one true world of Order, and the Courts of Chaos. Amberites of royal blood—those descended from Oberon (and ultimately his parents: Dworkin, formerly of the Courts of Chaos, and the Unicorn of Order herself) —are able to [...] "walk in Shadow", mentally willing changes to occur around them. These changes are, in effect, representative of the Shadow-walker passing through different realities. There are apparently infinite realities, and the characters in the novels are not sure if these different universes are created as one walks through Shadow, or if they already exist and a Shadow-walker is able to slip from one to another. In the Merlin cycle there are references to the Wheeler-Everett interpretation of quantum-mechanics and the Ghostwheel created by Merlin is said to [...] "shuffle" [...] through Shadows, suggesting that the multiverse exists independently, although this is never explicitly stated.|$|R

5|$|The main {{antagonist}} of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, is a mad {{scientist who}} created Crash Bandicoot among other characters and now seeks Crash's elimination along with <b>world</b> <b>domination.</b> The controlling force behind Cortex's plots for conquering {{the world is}} Uka Uka, the twin brother of Aku Aku. Four recurring villains from the series serve minor roles in the game: Doctor N.

5|$|As in most Mario series games, {{the main}} protagonist is Mario, whose initial {{goal is to}} rescue Princess Peach (Toadstool) from Bowser. However, the story takes on an unusual and very {{important}} twist. Soon {{after the start of}} his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived.

5|$|The Genghis Khan {{concentrates}} on {{the rise of the}} divided, constantly warring tribes of Mongolia into the mighty, fearsome Mongol Empire. Early missions of the campaign concentrate on uniting the several steppe tribes whilst also dealing with the 'Kara-Khitai', sworn enemies of Genghis Khan. With the other tribes either united or destroyed, Genghis now sets his eyes on <b>world</b> <b>domination.</b> The vast riches of the Khwaremia domain in Persia would be the obvious choice, but despite a pledge of support to the Mongols, the technologically superior Chinese Kingdoms have refused, thereby setting another example where Genghis directs his next campaign. With the entirety of China now under Mongolian rule, the Mongol horde now has the technology capable of knocking down the fortifications of Persia, and beyond.|$|E

5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve <b>world</b> <b>domination.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sequel to}} Dungeon Keeper, Dungeon Keeper 2 carries over many {{gameplay}} aspects, and adds new ones.

Some levels have multiple versions with differing methods of attack, allowing the player to choose the method and sub-region.|$|E
5|$|While {{imprisoned in}} 1924 after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler {{dictated}} Mein Kampf to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology {{in which he}} laid out his plans for transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief in Jewish Bolshevism, a conspiracy theory that posited {{the existence of an}} international Jewish conspiracy for <b>world</b> <b>domination</b> in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people. Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his world view as expounded in Mein Kampf. The NSDAP advocated the concept of a Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a foreign race (Fremdvölkische).|$|E

He then confronts Pete at the top of Hollow Bastion.|$|E
5|$|A third game {{entitled}} Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse {{was confirmed}} in May 2008 for release in 2009; {{the title was}} later pushed back to 2010, with concept art emerging after Telltale's completion of Tales of Monkey Island. The season again ran for five episodes, released monthly from April to August 2010.

After Coco's laptop battery dies, she forces a sleeping Crash to get her a new one. While doing so, Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex's castle, where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through the Warp Room's doors. After Crash collects a crystal, Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to him so that he may contain it. After retrieving a gem, Crash is greeted by a hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio, Cortex's former assistant from the previous game, who is now out to stop Cortex's plans for <b>world</b> <b>domination.</b> Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals, and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex.|$|E
40|$|In {{a process}} of <b>world</b> {{economic}} <b>domination</b> by an agro-industrial and agro-tertiary food system, the author wonders about the feasibility of an alternative model. The intensive agro-industrial model (financiarised, concentrated, specialized and globalised) allows remarkable results in terms of products prices and safety, but generates negative externalities. In the long term, this model could threat the food equilibrium of the populations and ecological balance of our planet. The concept of sustainable development provides some orientations on which the researchers are invited to work: definition of new food basis, design of shorter and more diversified productive and marketing systems, discussion of governance models, on a regional, national and international scale. These prospect simply the definition of voluntarist public policies...|$|R
40|$|The Ottoman Empire and Spain {{had survived}} through similar {{historical}} experiences and had confronted {{each other since}} {{the early years of}} the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman-Spanish struggle intensified as the Spanish kingdoms extended military aids to the Byzantine Empire and Albania while the Ottomans sent help to Muslims in Spain. The minor clashes in the earlier periods between these two states were followed by major wars in the 16 th century. Although there had been rapprochements and peace negotiations between the two states, none of the peace attempts were completed successfully because both the Ottoman Empire and Spain had a desire to establish <b>world</b> political <b>domination.</b> Eventually, the struggle period between the Ottoman Empire and Spain ended with a truce in 1581...|$|R
