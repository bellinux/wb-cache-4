5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> absolute power but would instead rule by the consent of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, {{the introduction of a}} machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967, she visited Guangzhou and {{witnessed}} the chaotic situation where the Cultural Revolution had just started. The dire effect was soon to be felt on Hong Kong's Studios which were influenced by Communist Party of China, and Great Wall's movies <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> the same cachet as before. Feeling insecure and threatened, and pregnant at the time, she excused herself from involvement in the political movement. Soon after she finished the screen performance in Oh, The Spring Is Here (1967), she resigned from studio in September, and quietly left for Canada before the film was released.|$|R

Of her husband she did not think at all.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the regional high school district, students from Franklin Lakes and Wyckoff had attended Ramsey High School as part of a sending/receiving relationship, until the Ramsey Public School District informed officials from the two communities that the Ramsey school <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> space to accommodate out-of-district students after the 1956-57 school year.|$|E
25|$|With all {{international}} scheduled flights {{returning to}} Montréal–Dorval in 1997, {{as well as}} charter flights in 2004, Montréal–Dorval International Airport finally became a true hub as passengers <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to travel to different airports depending on the destination of their flight. The consolidation of flights to Montréal–Dorval resulted {{in an increase in}} passenger traffic, not only due to the transfer of flights but because it became easier to connect through Montreal.|$|E
25|$|During {{the decades}} that {{followed}} the abandonment of Altenhus as a fortress, it was at times debated {{what should be done}} with the structure. In 1690, the population of Talvik requested the use of the timber of the blockhouse at Altenhus {{for the construction of a}} church, so the local people <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to travel to Hasvåg for church services. Permission was granted, and in 1692-1694, the timber of the fortress was employed in the building of a church on Årøya.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{problem of}} email {{filtering}} {{is a very}} practical one. As our lives become ever increasingly tied to the online world, the volume of email coming into our inboxes has also been increasing steadily. The need {{to make sense of}} all this information is critical if one is to retain their sanity amid spam, smut, silliness, and semblances of sense. The current solution usually consists of using a mail filtering program that can sort incoming mail based on userspecified rules. Many hours go into crafting filtering rules that can sort out mail from specific addresses or with specific subject lines. But keeping track of all these rules is yet again enough to drive one up the wall. New junk mail from new addresses keep coming through the door, and real correspondents change email addresses all the time. Here is where machine learning comes to the rescue. If we can train a machine, or rather a computer program, to learn what email should go where, then we <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>ha...</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the {{historian}} Karl Oettinger, the Graben replaced the Hoher Markt and Wipplingerstraße as Vienna's main arterial road. The new route supposedly led from Am Hof over Bognergasse and the Graben to Stock-im-Eisen-Platz, {{at that point}} turning {{in the direction of}} the Stephansdom, then passing over Rotenturmstraße to reach the Wollzeile. Traffic <b>would</b> therefore <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> needed to pass through the main market at Hoher Markt. However, as there was little reason at the time to travel {{in the direction of the}} Schottentor, this theory has been disputed.|$|R
25|$|After a {{few months}} in port, the men petitioned their captain for the pay they should have {{received}} since their employment began. If this request had been granted, the men <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> been tied to the ship and could easily have left, so predictably their petition was denied. After a similar petition to James Houblon by the men's wives had also failed, many of the sailors became desperate, believing that they had been sold into slavery to the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|In June 1941, German and Italian {{consulates}} were closed, {{and there}} were suggestions Japan's should be closed, as well. They were not, because they continued to provide valuable information (via MAGIC) and neither President Roosevelt nor Secretary Hull wanted trouble in the Pacific. Had they been closed, however, it is possible Naval General Staff, which had opposed the attack from the outset, would have called it off, since up-to-date information on {{the location of the}} Pacific Fleet, on which Yamamoto's plan depended, <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> been available.|$|E
25|$|One {{place where}} Japanese names may be {{translated}} into Chinese languages phonetically is in Japanese video games, anime and manga series. In May 2016, Nintendo sparked anger among fans in Hong Kong by announcing that its new Pokémon games, Sun and Moon, would {{be translated into}} Mandarin across all parts of China and Taiwan, meaning that names of well-known characters such as Pikachu <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the correct pronunciation when read {{in places such as}} Hong Kong and other regions where Mandarin is not the main language spoken.|$|E
50|$|One {{interesting}} little quirk to {{the game}} was that, {{it was possible to}} bomb your own ship as you took off from it. If you did this, when you returned it <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be there (<b>having</b> sunk, presumably) and being unable to land on it your plane would just continue flying until it ran out of fuel and crashed.|$|R
50|$|On October 22, 2007, Trolltech {{announced}} that it had sold all inventory of Greenphones and <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> continue production, <b>having</b> achieved its goal of promoting the Qtopia platform and gaining interest from developers.

50|$|In her sixth State of the Nation Address in 2006, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo {{promised that}} her {{administration}} would develop the Philippine Cyber Corridor {{along with other}} “natural ‘super regions’ of the Philippines”. Arroyo believed that the corridor had the potential for increasing telecommunications, technology and education in the country. In addition, she saw {{the development of the}} corridor as a counterpoint to the rising number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), as members of the work force <b>would</b> ideally <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to leave the country in order to secure a job. Furthermore, she promised budget increases for science & technology and education, both important to telecommunications.|$|R
25|$|The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland {{provided}} that children {{born on the}} island of Ireland to parents who were both foreign nationals <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> a constitutional right to citizenship of the Republic of Ireland. It was effected by the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act, 2004, which was approved by referendum on 11 June 2004 and signed into law on 24 June of the same year. It partially reversed changes made to the Constitution by the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which was passed as part of the Good Friday Agreement.|$|E
25|$|After a {{long and}} acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at Schönefeld, the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> {{required}} her father's consent. Their marriage proved a remarkable business partnership, with Clara acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidant to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after they married, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Copp and Hayes gently {{explained}} to Chapman that he <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> monopoly use of the DFV and in August 1967 {{it was announced that}} the power unit would be available for sale, via Cosworth Engineering, to racing teams throughout the world. Hayes released the DFV initially to French team Matra, headed by Ken Tyrrell with Jackie Stewart as a driver. What followed was a golden age, where teams big or small could buy an engine which was competitive, light, compact, easy to work with and relatively cheap (£7,500 at 1967 prices or about £90,000 in 2005 money). The DFV effectively replaced the Coventry Climax as the standard F1 powerplant for the private (mostly British) teams.|$|E
50|$|In March 2008, APTN {{launched}} a high definition feed known as APTN HD; initially, the HD feed was a straight simulcast of APTN's Eastern cable feed, {{complying with the}} requirement that a specialty channel's HD simulcast must be 95% identical in programming and scheduling to its standard-definition feeds. In May 2017, the CRTC amended APTN's license so that APTN HD's programming <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> necessarily <b>have</b> to mirror the scheduling of the SD feeds, as long as 95% of its programming had aired at some point on one of APTN's SD feeds. The network argued that this change would allow it more flexibility in scheduling programming on APTN HD to reach a broader audience.|$|R
50|$|Due to its lighter {{weight and}} {{improved}} aerodynamics the Firebird Convertible was finally available through GM's normal ordering procedures. ASC still converted T-top cars into convertibles but the ordering process was simplified and dealers <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> need to <b>have</b> the cars drop shipped to ASC in Michigan. The Convertibles were offered {{with one of}} three engine options: LHO 3.1L V6, the L03 5.0L V8 for the base Firebird, or the LB9 5.0L V8 Trans Am only.|$|R
50|$|Theatres were {{switching}} over to {{gas lighting}} {{not just because}} it was more economical than using candles but also required less labor to operate. With gas lighting, theatres <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> need to <b>have</b> people tending to candles during a performance, or having to light each candle individually. “It was easier to light a row of gas jets than a greater quantity of candles high in the air.” Theatres also <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> needed to worry about wax dripping on the actors during a show.|$|R
25|$|In 1955, NBC {{broadcast}} a live production in color of Peter Pan, a new Broadway musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie's beloved play, on the Producers' Showcase anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical's entire original cast, led by Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard in a dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It {{was so successful}} that NBC restaged it as a live {{broadcast a}} mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers' Showcase had ended its run, Peter Pan, {{with most of the}} 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to be performed live on television.|$|E
25|$|The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 aroused greater {{interest}} {{within the government}} in constitutional reform. Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights, as well as patriation of the Constitution, meaning the British Parliament <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to approve constitutional amendments. Subsequently, Attorney General Pierre Trudeau appointed law professor Barry Strayer to research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer consulted {{with a number of}} notable legal scholars, including Walter Tarnopolsky. Strayer's report advocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the Charter, including protection for language rights. Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights. Finally, he recommended allowing for limits on rights. Such limits are included in the Charter's limitation and notwithstanding clauses. In 1968, Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office and in 1974 he became Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice. During those years, Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted.|$|E
25|$|Azusa {{participants}} {{returned to}} their homes carrying their new experience with them. In many cases, whole churches were converted to the Pentecostal faith, but many times Pentecostals were forced to establish new religious communities when their experience {{was rejected by the}} established churches. One of the first areas of involvement was the African continent, where, by 1907, American missionaries were established in Liberia, as well as in South Africa by 1908. Because speaking in tongues was initially believed to always be actual foreign languages, it was believed that missionaries <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to learn the languages of the peoples they evangelized because the Holy Spirit would provide whatever foreign language was required. (When the majority of missionaries, to their disappointment, learned that tongues speech was unintelligible on the mission field, Pentecostal leaders were forced to modify their understanding of tongues.) Thus, as the experience of speaking in tongues spread, a sense of the immediacy of Christ's return took hold and that energy would be directed into missionary and evangelistic activity. Early Pentecostals saw themselves as outsiders from mainstream society, dedicated solely to preparing the way for Christ's return.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} {{somebody}} will say, [...] "That is nonsense. The disc-shadows are not rigid figures.

[...] But what if the two-foot rule were to behave on the plane E {{in the same way}} as the disc-shadows L'? It would then be impossible to show that the shadows increase in size as they move away from S; such an assertion <b>would</b> then <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any meaning whatever. In fact the only objective assertion that can be made about the disc-shadows is just this, that they are related in exactly the same way as are the rigid discs on the spherical surface in the sense of Euclidean geometry.|$|R

To become a whiffling noise, cold, without one's self! To drift on the breath of that noise, homeless! Up here, there were not even those little velvet, grey-white flower-comrades we had plucked. No life! Nothing but the {{creeping}} wind, and those great rocky heights, whence came the sound of falling-symbols of that cold, untimely state into which we, too, must pass. Never more to love, nor to be loved! One could but turn to the earth, and press one's face to it, away from the wild loveliness. Of what use loveliness that must be lost; of what use loveliness when one could not love? The earth was warm and firm beneath the palms of the hands; but there still came {{the sound of the}} impartial wind, and the careless roar of the stories falling.|$|R
25|$|The {{site of the}} Cira Centre sits {{within a}} Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). A KOZ was {{designed}} to encourage development in poor and blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from almost all state and local taxes. In 2002 the Center City office vacancy rate was 12.5 percent and numerous businesses leases were set to expire in 2005 and 2006. Owners of other buildings were critical of having the KOZ for the Cira Centre and the proposed KOZ designation for the Comcast Center, another office high-rise being planned. The landlords were afraid that the tax breaks for the new skyscrapers would attract their existing tenants to the new buildings. On December 24, 2003 Brandywine Realty Trust announced the first tenants to lease room in the Cira Centre. Brandywine Realty Trust signed leases with Dechert LLP, Woodcock Washburn LLP, and Attalus Capital. Dechert LLP and Woodcock Washburn LLP were moving from other city skyscrapers, the Bell Atlantic Tower and One Liberty Place respectively. Attalus Capital was moving its offices from Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Dechert and Woodcock Washburn moving to the Cira Centre fueled the KOZ controversy because Dechert and Woodcock Washburn were wealthy law firms and <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to pay taxes for numerous years. By 2006, about 60 percent of Cira Centre's tenants came from within Philadelphia.|$|E

500|$|... {{offers a}} {{different}} theory: The Acra {{was still standing}} in 139BCE when AntiochusVII Sidetes demanded it back from Simon, along with Jaffa and Gezer, two Hellenized cities Simon had captured. Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but {{made no mention of}} the Acra. It was at this point that he must have sealed its fate, as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem. Thus, when AntiochusVII subdued the city during Hyrcanus I's reign, {{each and every one of}} his demands were met—except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city. Hyrcanus may have been able to reject, and Antiochus to drop, this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison, as the Acra <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> been standing. This explanation places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130sBCE.|$|E
