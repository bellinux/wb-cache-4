500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, I will tell you this... we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E

Lutz (John Lutz)—the staff writers of the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS)—were going to be seen more in the upcoming season, to which he replied, [...] "One {{of the great things}} about this show and the blessing and the curse is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> characters and so many different interactions between characters that work so well.

In this episode, Liz Lemon, the head writer for TGS, discovers that Frank, Toofer, and Lutz, along with Pete, do not invite her to hang out with them as they consider her a mother figure.|$|E
500|$|While Glee also {{features}} Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers {{declined to give}} the two scenes together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond [...] "Home", Falchuk commented that the producers want to [...] "have her around as much as possible", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: [...] " [...] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back. The one advantage we have, I think, is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> incredibly talented people in our … cast that … we don't need [...] as much. But there are certain very special people that, of course, you'd always be interested in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, pray don't {{speak of}} it,' {{returned}} Fanny. 'I believe Papa {{had the pleasure}} of inviting Mr Sparkler twice or thrice,--but it was nothing. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people about us, and kept such open house, that if he had that pleasure, it was less than nothing.' ...|$|R

500|$|Patton {{developed}} {{an ability to}} deliver charismatic speeches, {{in part because he}} had trouble with reading. He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command but offended other generals, including Bradley. The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord. When speaking, he was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, [...] "The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored halftrack and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> God-awful drivers." [...] During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should [...] "let the sons-of-bitches [...] {{go all the way to}} Paris, then we'll cut them off and round them up." [...] He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could [...] "drive the British back into the sea for another Dunkirk." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Carol Polsgrove {{has shown}} in Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause, Padmore {{and his allies}} in the 1930s and 1940s—among them C. L. R. James, Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta, the Gold Coast's Kwame Nkrumah and South Africa's Peter Abrahams—saw {{publishing}} as a strategy for political change. They published small periodicals, which were sometimes seized by authorities {{when they reached the}} colonies. They published articles in other people's periodicals, for instance, the Independent Labour Party's New Leader. They published pamphlets. They wrote letters to the editor; and, thanks to the support of publisher Fredric Warburg (of Secker & Warburg), they published books. Warburg brought out Padmore's Africa and World Peace (1937), as well as books by both Kenyatta and James. In a Foreword to Africa and World Peace, Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps wrote: [...] "George Padmore has performed another great service of enlightenment in this book. The facts he discloses so ruthlessly are undoubtedly unpleasant facts, the story which he tells of the colonization of Africa is sordid in the extreme, but both the facts and the story are true. <b>We</b> <b>have,</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of us, been brought up in the atmosphere of 'the white man's burden', and have had our minds clouded and confused by the continued propaganda for imperialism that we may be almost shocked by this bare and courageous exposure of the great myth of the civilizing mission of western democracies in Africa." [...] The Biographical Note on the cover describes Padmore as European correspondent for the Pittsburgh Courier, Gold Coast Spectator, African Morning Post, Panama Tribune, Belize Independent and Bantu World.|$|E

5000|$|It {{took nearly}} a year to put Misfits {{together}}, a couple of band members left, and Mick Avory didn't {{really want to do}} it. And and I got together like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times before, playing Chuck Berry records, having a laugh.
