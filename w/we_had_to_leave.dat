500|$|In {{order to}} ship the game, Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and {{multiplayer}} {{parts of the}} game. Chris Butcher commented, [...] "For Halo 2 we had our sights set very high on networking. ... Going from having no Internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once, {{and as a result}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> a lot of things undone {{in order to meet the}} ship date commitment that we made to our fans." [...] With only a year to go until release, Bungie went into the [...] "mother of all crunches" [...] in order to finish the game; in a 2007 interview, Jamie Griesemer, one of Halos design leads, said that this lack of a [...] "polish" [...] period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for Halo 2s shortcomings. Butcher retrospectively described Halo 2s multiplayer mode as [...] "a pale shadow of what it could and should have been if we had gotten the timing of our schedule right"; the campaign mode's abrupt cliffhanger ending also resulted from the frenzy to ship on time.|$|E
500|$|The {{creative}} {{struggle was}} {{evident from the}} outset. Hoppus loved everything regarding Enema of the State — including the music videos and live show — and [...] "wanted to do it again," [...] desiring to create a bigger, better and louder follow-up. DeLonge, however, was striving for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock, which was inspired by post-hardcore bands Fugazi and Refused. Barker, [...] "never simply a punk rock drummer," [...] wanted to challenge himself and was listening to {{a great deal of}} hip hop and heavy metal. The lyrics often turned darker and more introspective for Hoppus, and [...] "love songs became broken love songs." [...] DeLonge rewrote some of his lyrics after listening to songs by Alkaline Trio, feeling as though he needed to [...] "step up his game." [...] DeLonge pushed his guitar style further away from that on Enema of the State: [...] "Arpeggiated guitar hooks became frenetic 1/16th note spasms," [...] wrote Hoppus in 2013. Barker's drum parts were looped and filtered, creating different sounds. For the first time, the trio worked in opposition to one another, and the sessions sometimes became contentious. Hoppus felt that the sessions created an unspoken competition between him and DeLonge, between who could write the better chorus or most clever lyrics. [...] "Our confidence and insecurity begat some heated differences, sometime to the point where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> rooms and cool down," [...] recalled Hoppus. Finn would often smooth over differences with a joke, offering a fresh perspective and advice.|$|E

"Oh, yes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him behind, though Francie {{was ready}} to break her heart over it; but they said that nothing would do for Ivinghoe--after this second influenza--but a sea voyage, {{so she had to}} make up her mind to leave him to my mother." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{it is my}} home!" [...] she answered, looking hurt at my {{careless}} words. [...] "I {{was born}} there, and married there, and have always lived at Branscombe with my people until my husband got work in this place; then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> home and come and live in this cottage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, in time," [...] was the prompt answer. [...] "I'm sorry <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon behind us, for they'd come {{in handy}} just now; but {{with the end of}} our journey in sight a tramp across these pretty green fields won't tire us a bit." ...|$|E
60|$|Saturday, Jan. 9.—Strolled {{about all}} the forenoon. “What a time of blessed {{composure}} it has been,” said Mr. G. with a heavy sigh. The distant hills covered with snow, {{and the voice of}} the storm gradually swelling. Still the savage fury of the sea was yet some hours off, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Biarritz without the spectacle of Atlantic rage at its fiercest.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 it was {{reported}} during misty nights the lit glasshouses were a source of light pollution in the form [...] "a clearly visible night glow". The company were quoted [...] "For ventilation purposes <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> tiny gaps where the blinds meet. Even when the blinds are fully closed we estimate that approximately 2 per cent of area is uncovered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Sam, [...] "this {{may turn}} out to be a small barren island, in which case <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it and trust to falling in with some vessel; or it may be {{inhabited}} by savages or pirates, in which case <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it from prudential motives, if they will allow us to do so. In any case, we won't begin by being extravagant with the provisions to-day." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{are facing}} a common enemy and that enemy is Yankee Imperialism, which is killing us both here and abroad. Now I think anyone who would try to {{separate}} those struggles, anyone who would say {{that in order to}} consolidate an anti-war movement, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right {{into the hands of the}} enemy", she declared.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} we are greatly obliged to you," [...] Jean said. [...] "As I told you, when {{relating}} our adventure in Nantes, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> our horses behind us there though, had we captured the town, we should have recovered them. As it is, the Blues carried off the two I had left behind at the chateau, and I could only buy one other, as we came through. That I detailed for the use of my wife. I certainly had not expected to obtain another, until we captured some from the enemy. We are heartily obliged to you, not only for your generous gift, but for your thoughtful kindness in sending for them for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know your}} Southern States. We lived there in poverty, {{wandering}} up and down. My father is what his friends call a patriot, and his enemies a dangerous agitator. He {{had to choose}} between ruin and acquiescence in corrupt tyranny, and his course was plain. But the seed he had sown sprouted, the dictator was driven out, and we came back to our own. Then, for a time, there was rest and safety, until the new ruler began to follow the old. He tried to bribe my father, who had helped to put him in power; but our honor was not for sale, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the capital. There are men who trust my father, and look to him for help.... But I think you know something of this." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth I was glad. Although at first the idea had appealed to me a little, I {{did not want to}} make this wild-goose, or wild-witch chase through unknown lands to seek for a totally fabulous person who dwelt far across the Zambesi. I had, as it were, been forced into the thing, but if Umslopogaas did not appear, my {{obligations}} would be at an end and I should return to Natal at my leisure. First, however, I would do a little shooting since I found that a large herd of elephants haunted this forest. Indeed I was tempted to attack them at once, but did not do so since, as Hans pointed out, if we were going north {{it would be difficult to}} carry the ivory, especially if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the waggon, and I was too old a hunter to desire to kill the great beasts for the fun of the thing.|$|E

60|$|We {{satisfied}} our pilgrims {{by making}} those hard rides from Baalbec to Damascus, but Dan's horse and Jack's were so crippled <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> them behind and get fresh animals for them. The dragoman says Jack's horse died. I swapped horses with Mohammed, the kingly-looking Egyptian who is our Ferguson's lieutenant. By Ferguson I mean our dragoman Abraham, of course. I {{did not take}} this horse {{on account of his}} personal appearance, but because I have not seen his back. I do not wish to see it. I have seen the backs of all the other horses, and found most of them covered with dreadful saddle-boils which I know have not been washed or doctored for years. The idea of riding all day long over such ghastly inquisitions of torture is sickening. My horse must be like the others, but I have at least the consolation of not knowing it to be so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Paul," [...] she whispered, [...] "think! Think {{how sweet}} life might be. There {{is so much}} truth in all this. I know little of politics, but think of the hard times we have lived through. Think how glorious to have you ride in your {{automobile}} to the offices of your newspaper, to see you pass into the editor's sanctum instead of waiting outside, to have me call for you, perhaps, and take you out to lunch--no, never at Drevel's any more--at the Café de Paris, or Henry's, or Paillard's, or out in the Bois! And the excursions, dear Paul. Think of them! The country--how we both love the country! You remember when we first went out together to the little town on the river, where no one ever seemed {{to have come from}} Paris before? How sleepy and quiet the long afternoon, when we lay in the grass and heard the birds sing, and the murmur of the river, and we had only a few francs for our dinner, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the train and walk that last four miles because you had drunk one more bock. Dear Paul, think what life might be if one were really rich!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{times of}} peace, we seldom stop long in one {{neighbourhood}} for, when it once becomes known what road we are lying near, they come along in parties too strong {{to be attacked}} and, as it matters little to us where we live, we move away perhaps a hundred miles, and then settle on another line of traffic. We have not been here long; we were last down by Tannoo, and did well {{for a long time}} there; until at last the governor raised all the villagers, and hunted the woods, and we found that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> I expect we shall stay here some time, now. There is no fear of troops being sent out, and we can afford not to press too hardly on travellers; for we have done so well, of late, that we could separate and return to our homes, each with a good store of booty. Half our number did leave, when we came up from the south; and more of us would go, {{if it were not for}} this order that everyone shall join the army. It is much pleasanter to live here, free to do as we like, than to be driven down like a herd of beasts, to fight. Besides, we have no quarrel with your people. It was the officials at Aracan who began it; let them fight, if they like." ...|$|E

"It is well," [...] Archie said, [...] "for {{if in the}} end <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the castle, you, {{who have}} proved {{yourself}} so strong and brave, can, if needs be, take to the hills with me; {{but she could not}} support the fatigues of such a life. And now, dear, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> marched all night and shall be glad of food; while it is preparing I will to the walls and see what is going on." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{play with}} a graph-theoretic {{analogue}} of the folklore infinite monkey theorem.

6000|$|W. {{went with}} me. After a little <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> our horses, and {{scramble}} {{about a mile}} up the mountain. [...] "C. was right, and we are wrong," [...] said my companion, sententiously. I was just dubious enough to be silent. Pretty soon {{we came to a}} tremendous ravine, as if an earthquake had rent a mountain asunder. A hundred feet down in this black gorge, a stream was roaring in a succession of mad leaps, and a bridge crossed it, where we stood to gaze down into its dark, awful depths. Then on we went till we came to the glacier. What a mass of clear, blue ice! so very blue, so clear! This awful chasm runs directly under it, and the mountain torrent, formed by the melting of the glacier, falls in a roaring cascade into it. You can go down into a cavern in this rift. Above your head a roof of clear, blue ice; below your feet this black chasm, with the white, flashing foam of the cascade, as it leaps away into the darkness. On one side of the glacier was a little sort of cell, or arched nook, up which an old man had cut steps, and he helped me up into it. I stood in a little Gothic shrine of blue, glittering ice, and looked out of an arched window at the cascade and mountains. I thought of Coleridge's line-- ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{finding the}} place we had had the help of two policemen and one newsboy and a postman in losing {{ourselves}} in the Prado where we mostly sought for it, and with difficulty kept ourselves from being thrust into the gallery there. In Spain a man, or even a boy, does not like to say {{he does not know}} where a place is; he is either too proud or too polite to do it, and he will misdirect you without mercy. But the morning was bright, and almost warm, and we should have looked forward to weeks of sunny weather if our experience had not taught us that it would rain in the afternoon, and if greater experience than ours had not instructed us that there would be many days of thick fog now before the climate of Madrid settled itself to the usual brightness of February. We had time to note again in the Paseo Castellana, which is the fashionable drive, that it consists of four rows of acacias and tamarisks and a stretch of lawn, with seats beside it; the rest is bare grasslessness, with a bridle-path {{on one side and a}} tram-line on the other. If it had been late afternoon the Paseo would have been filled with the gay world, but being the late forenoon <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it well-nigh unpeopled and go back to our hotel, where the excellent midday breakfast merited the best appetite one could bring to it.|$|E
6000|$|We {{spent one}} night at Middelburg, and next morning, bidding adieu to our kind English friends, started for Pretoria, taking care to end our first day's journey at a house where an Englishman lived, so as to ensure a clean shakedown. Here we {{discovered}} that the horse I was riding (the sole survivor of the five we had started with) had got the sickness, and so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him and hire another. This horse, by the by, recovered, {{which is the only}} instance of an animal's conquering the disease which has yet come under my observation. We hired the new horse from a Boer, who charged us exactly three times its proper price, and then preached us a sermon quite {{a quarter of an hour}} long on his hospitality, his kindness of heart, and his willingness to help strangers. I must tell you that, just as we were going to sleep the night before, a stranger had come and asked for a shakedown, which was given to him in the same room. We had risen before daybreak, and my companion was expatiating to me, in clear and forcible language, on the hypocrisy and scoundrelism of this Boer, when suddenly a sleepy voice out of the darkness murmured thickly, [...] "I say, stranger, guess you shouldn't lose your temper; guess that 'ere Boer is acting after the manner of human natur'." [...] And then the owner of the voice turned over and went to sleep again.|$|E
