5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital {{costs associated with the}} schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} <b>written</b> <b>agreements</b> outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E

25|$|When Steve Jobs {{returned}} to Apple in 1997, he stopped all Macintosh clone efforts, which {{shut down the}} Apple Pippin concept. Once Apple stopped all development of the Pippin platform, it affected all parties. Bandai stopped production of all models of Pippin by mid-1997. Katz Media, who was receiving its systems from Bandai, vowed to continue supporting Pippin in a PR notice released June 25, 1997. Katz Media reportedly had some 100,000 units committed because of <b>written</b> <b>agreements</b> with companies spanning twenty countries. The company would eventually file for bankruptcy {{by the end of}} 1998. On February 27, 1998, DayStar Digital purchased all remaining inventory of hardware from Bandai, and sold the inventory to anyone who would buy them. A former employee of DayStar placed sales of the Pippin through its distribution chain as high as 2,000 systems.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} been mired in {{litigation}} on Guam and in California.

In March 2008, the case was dismissed and Laing was ordered to pay Guam's legal fees. Laing appealed twice and lost both appeals. GEDCA called Laing's California lawsuit a [...] "tactical maneuver". Laing was also sued by the Government of Guam for fraud. Matthew Borden, attorney for the GEDCA, accused Laing of coming to the island with intention to defraud the government and people of Guam. In a retort, Laing claimed the Government of Guam pledged $3 million in loans and other incentives if he were to come to the island and make Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon there. Guam officials denied making such a pledge and Laing admitted he did not possess any <b>written</b> <b>agreements</b> on the matter.|$|E

2500|$|The Order of the Gorgon's Head, another {{secret society}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was founded in 1896 by Darius Eatman, Edward Kidder Graham, Ralph Henry Graves, Samuel Selden Lamb, Richard Henry Lewis, Jr., and Percy DePonceau Whitaker. Membership has always been limited to male members of the junior, senior, professional, and {{post-graduate}} classes along with male faculty members. Inductees may not be members of other societies. Officers include Princeps (chief officer), Quaestor, and Scriptor. The purpose of the Order is to promote friendship, good will, and social fellowship among its members. The Order of the Gorgon's Head {{was one of two}} [...] "junior orders" [...] established at the University in the 1890s. The two orders had <b>written</b> <b>agreements</b> that they would not attempt to recruit freshmen or sophomores. Each order had a lodge (the Gimghouls later built a castle), where members gathered for meetings and events. Each had secret rituals based on myths. Those of the Order of the Gorgon's Head centered on the myth of the Gorgons, three monstrous sisters prominent in ancient Greek and Roman lore.|$|E
2500|$|An Australian {{workplace}} agreement (AWA) was {{a type of}} formalised {{individual agreement}} negotiated between an employer and employee in Australia that existed for a short number {{of years in the}} 2000s. Employers could offer a [...] "take it or leave it" [...] AWA as a condition of employment. They were registered by the Employment Advocate and did not require a dispute resolution procedure. These agreements operated only at the federal level. AWAs were individual <b>written</b> <b>agreements</b> on terms and conditions of employment between an employer and employee in Australia, under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. An AWA could override employment conditions in state or territory laws except those relating to occupational health and safety, workersâ€™ compensation, or training arrangements. An AWA was required to meet only the most minimal Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Agreements were not required to include effective dispute resolution procedures, and could not include prohibited content. Agreements were for a maximum of five years; approved, promoted and registered by the Workplace Authority; operated to the exclusion of any award; and prohibited industrial action regarding details in the agreement {{for the life of the}} agreement. The introduction of AWAs was a very controversial industrial relations issue in Australia.|$|E

2500|$|The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Republic of India, Pakistan and Japan have {{formally}} {{adopted the}} One China policy, {{under which the}} People's Republic of China is theoretically the sole legitimate government of China. However, the United States and Japan acknowledge rather than recognize the PRC position that Taiwan is part of China. In the case of Canada and the UK, bilateral <b>written</b> <b>agreements</b> state that the two respective parties take note of Beijing's position but do not use the word support. The UK government position that [...] "the future of Taiwan be decided peacefully by the peoples of {{both sides of the}} Strait" [...] has been stated several times. Despite the PRC claim that the United States opposes Taiwanese independence, the United States takes advantage of the subtle difference between [...] "oppose" [...] and [...] "does not support". In fact, a substantial majority of the statements Washington has made says that it [...] "does not support Taiwan independence" [...] instead of saying that it [...] "opposes" [...] independence. Thus, the US does not take a position on the political outcome, except for one explicit condition that there be a peaceful resolution to {{the differences between the two}} sides of the Taiwan Strait. The United States bi-partisan position is that it doesn't recognize the PRC's claim over Taiwan, and considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. All of this ambiguity has resulted in the United States constantly walking on a diplomatic tightrope with regard to cross strait relations.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{terms in}} oral or <b>written</b> <b>agreements,</b> terms can be {{incorporated}} by reference. Two main sources are collective agreements and company handbooks. In JI Case Co v National Labor Relations Board an employing corporation argued {{it should not have}} to bargain in good faith with a labor union, and did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing, because it had recently signed individual contracts with its employees. The US Supreme Court held unanimously that the [...] "very purpose" [...] of collective bargaining and the National Labor Relations Act 1935 was [...] "to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group". Terms of collective agreements, to the advantage of individual employees, therefore supersede individual contracts. Similarly, if a written contract states that employees do not have rights, but an employee has been told they do by a supervisor, or rights are assured in a company handbook, they will usually have a claim. For example, in Torosyan v Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc the Supreme Court of Connecticut held that a promise in a handbook that an employee could be dismissed only for a good reason (or [...] "just cause") was binding on the employing corporation. Furthermore, an employer had no right to unilaterally change the terms. Most other state courts have reached the same conclusion, that contracts cannot be altered, except for employees' benefit, without new consideration and true agreement. By contrast, a slight majority on the California Supreme Court, appointed by Republican governors, held in Asmus v Pacific Bell that a company policy of indefinite duration can be altered after a reasonable time with reasonable notice, if it affects no vested benefits. The four dissenting judges, appointed by Democratic governors, held this was a [...] "patently unfair, indeed unconscionable, result â€“ permitting an employer that made a promise of continuing job security... to repudiate that promise with impunity several years later". In addition, a basic term of good faith which cannot be waived, is implied by common law or equity in all states. This usually demands, as a general principle that [...] "neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party, to receive the fruits of the contract". The term of good faith persists throughout the employment relationship. It has not yet been used extensively by state courts, compared to other jurisdictions. The Montana Supreme Court has recognized that extensive and even punitive damages could be available for breach of an employee's reasonable expectations. However others, such as the California Supreme Court limit any recovery of damages to contract breaches, but not damages regarding the manner of termination. By contrast, in the United Kingdom the requirement for [...] "good faith" [...] has been found to limit the power of discharge except for fair reasons (but not to conflict with statute), in Canada it may limit unjust discharge also for self-employed persons, and in Germany it can preclude the payment of wages significantly below average.|$|E
