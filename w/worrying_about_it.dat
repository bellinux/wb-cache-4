2500|$|Henderson {{was painted}} in water-colour as The Man with the Donkey by Horace Moore-Jones. Moore-Jones worked from Jackson's {{photograph}} of Henderson, but believed {{it to be}} of John Simpson Kirkpatrick. At least six versions of the painting were made, and it was extensively reproduced as a portrait of Simpson; the inscriptions on some versions implied that Simpson was nicknamed [...] "Murphy". In a newspaper interview in 1950, Henderson said that he, not Simpson, was {{the man in the}} paintings. He had [...] "watched the legend grow" [...] without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but was now old and [...] "want the matter cleared up". It was also untrue that Simpson was known as [...] "Murphy". Murphy {{was the name of the}} donkey, which Simpson had found wandering on the beach.|$|E

60|$|It was the work, she {{explained}} {{as they walked}} on. It made your hands like that after a time. If only she could have {{got out of it}} earlier! But now! It was no good <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now.|$|E

The agent who comes round doesn't listen to excuses. You pay, or out {{you go into the}} street. I've paid somehow and nearly starved over it. Then I got this job after <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> Lord knows how long, and this evening I'm discharged." ...|$|E

I tell her I am not praetor of the fire guard, and that it does not come within my scope of duty. I went down {{yesterday}} afternoon, but the soldiers and citizens are all doing their work under their officers, and doubtless it will soon be extinguished." ...|$|E

[...] He went to an old fashioned cabinet, and placed the coin and piece of paper in a very cunningly devised secret drawer. The next morning he went out into the garden and dropped the battered snuffbox into the well, and then dismissed the subject from his mind.|$|E
60|$|It isn't serious at all, but--well, {{mother is}} <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You know how old-fashioned she is. And when you {{consider}} our position--father's and Tom's, I mean--it doesn't seem just right {{for you to be}} seeing so much of such an enemy of theirs. He has abused them dreadfully, you know. And there's that dreadful speech he is going to give to-morrow. You haven't seen the afternoon papers. He has made the most terrible charges against everybody--all of us, our friends, everybody.|$|E

60|$|Carol {{drove through}} an {{astonishing}} {{number of books}} from the public library and from city shops. Kennicott was at first uncomfortable over her disconcerting habit of buying them. A book was a book, {{and if you had}} several thousand of them right here in the library, free, why the dickens should you spend your good money? After <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for two or three years, he decided that {{this was one of the}} Funny Ideas which she had caught as a librarian and from which she would never entirely recover.|$|E
60|$|Lawrence Pentfield {{began to}} think that his partner was a great deal in the company of Mabel Holmes for a fellow who was going east to see his people. He even caught himself <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at times, though he would have worried more had he not known Mabel and Corry so well. Mabel's letters, on the other hand, had a great deal to say about Corry. Also, a thread of {{timidity}} that was near to disinclination ran through them concerning the trip in over the ice and the Dawson marriage. Pentfield wrote back heartily, laughing at her fears, which he took to be the mere physical ones of danger and hardship rather than those bred of maidenly reserve.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, my dear," [...] John Thorndyke said lightly. [...] "Some of {{the fellows}} we have sentenced {{may think that}} we were rather hard on them, but I {{do not think that}} any of them would feel it {{sufficiently}} to attempt to murder one; besides, Mark says that the fellow had a horse waiting for him, and none of our poachers would be likely to be the owner of a horse. It may be that the highwayman Mark shot at and wounded has come down to give us a fright. It is no use <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now; in future we will have the shutters closed at sunset. It is hardly likely that the thing will be attempted again, and Mark's chase must have shown the fellow that the game is hardly worth the risk." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{idea is that}} he couldn’t," [...] {{said the}} captain, obstinately. [...] "If a thing {{has got to be}} it will be, and there’s no good <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Take a simple example. Some time you are going to die of a certain disease—you can only die once—and you’re going to be buried in a certain grave—you can only be buried in one grave. Try and think that in front of you there is that one {{particular}} disease told off to kill you at a certain date, and in one particular spot of all this earth there is a grave waiting to be dug for you. At present we don’t know the date, or the disease, or the grave, but there they are, all waiting for you. That is fate. What is the matter? Where are you going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I need {{scarcely}} say that, {{after what}} has happened, I shall reconsider my decision; for the sooner she is married, {{and beyond the}} reach of a repetition of this outrage, the better. I imagine, however, that the young gentleman will be no better satisfied than I am, that the matter should have been passed over so lightly; and will take it into his own hands, and send a challenge immediately to the vicomte. He is high spirited, and has the reputation among us of being a good fencer, but I doubt whether he can possess such skill as that which de Tulle has acquired. It is not always the injured person that comes off victorious in a duel; and, should fortune go against Monsieur de la Vallee, it would be a terrible blow to my daughter, and indeed to myself, for I am much attached to him. She is <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> already.|$|E
6000|$|As for me, I do {{not quite}} {{see why we}} should rest content with {{anything}} of the sort. It {{is not a very}} definite statement. It does not necessarily mean anything more than that he did not wish to go into the tedious details of those family quarrels. Delicacy could quite properly excuse him from saying, [...] "I was in love with Cornelia all that time; my wife kept crying and <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and upbraiding me and begging me to cut myself free from a connection which was wronging her and disgracing us both; and I being stung by these reproaches retorted with fierce and bitter speeches--for it is my nature to do that when I am stirred, especially if the target of them is a person whom I had greatly loved and respected before, as witness my various attitudes towards Miss Hitchener, the Gisbornes, Harriet's sister, and others--and finally I did not improve this state of things when I deserted my wife and spent a whole month with the woman who had infatuated me." ...|$|E
50|$|COFFEE's memory {{management}} is handled entirely by a garbage collection process; essentially {{this means that}} it looks after itself, and the programmer seldom needs to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> However, {{it is possible to}} control the process explicitly when necessary.|$|R

6000|$|... "You do indeed. Look at me. I haven't {{a line on}} my face as {{compared}} with yours and I've held together a patchwork Government for five years. I don't know when I may be kicked out and I know perfectly well that the Government which succeeds mine is going to undo all I have done {{and is going to}} establish a state of things in this country which I consider nothing short of revolutionary. I am not <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Tallente. The fog of Downing Street stinks sometimes in my nostrils, but I have a little country house--you must come and see me there some day--down in Buckinghamshire, one of these long, low bungalow types, you know, with big gardens, two tennis courts, and a golf course just across the river. My wife spends most of her time there now and every week-end, when I go down, I think what a fool I am to waste my time trying to hold a reluctant nation to principles they are thoroughly sick of. Tallente, you can turn me out whenever you like. The day I settle down for two or three months' rest {{is going to be one}} of the happiest of my life." ...|$|E
