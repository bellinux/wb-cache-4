Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of our best science journalists.|$|E

The Bump can be climbed using the North Norfolk Coastal Path from either the east or west, and is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> climb. From the top, there are views of the surrounding land and sea. Each Easter, the combined churches in the area make a pilgrimage carrying a cross {{to the top of}} Beeston Bump, and an open-air service takes place.|$|E
25|$|Solving such {{problems}} {{is actually an}} easy task and it is simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the data could become very tricky, but once it’s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped with the tools to record the trajectory information in binary format.|$|E

25|$|The {{programming}} of the {{stored program}} for ENIAC {{was done by}} Betty Jennings, Clippinger and Adele Goldstine. It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer on September 16, 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for John von Neumann. This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC {{by a factor of}} six and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time to hours instead of days, it was considered <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely I/O bound, even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.|$|E

The desire by the designers of the highway, the general public, and the numerous preservation organizations to maintain the historic character of the corridor and to maintain its unique character made the cost extraordinairly high but it was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> cost. Dry-laid limestone rock fences were dismantled and reconstructed by hand, for instance, and extensive landscaping and tree planting using native species were utilized. As {{a result of}} this careful construction, the Paris Pike project won a 2002 Merit-Design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects as well as the 2003 Federal Highway Administration's Environmental Excellence Award and the National Partnership for Highway Quality 2003 State Award.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan {{felt that it}} was [...] "one of the strongest soundtracks" [...] of any NES game, a sentiment that Patrick Gann of RPGFan agreed with. Gann further declared the main theme [...] "Eternal Wind" [...] to [...] "quite possibly be the best world map music" [...] in a video game. Jon Turner of Soundtrack Central felt that, although the sound limitations of the album detracted it {{in the eyes of many}} listeners, the album was still <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> purchase. Dave of Square Enix Music Online, however, disagreed, feeling that, although it was [...] "charming", it was [...] "one of the weaker Final Fantasy albums".|$|E
500|$|Overall, reviewers {{acknowledged}} Freelancer {{fell short}} of the promises initially made by Roberts; however, it demonstrated a high quality of work in its implemented features. [...] The various concepts were well meshed together to form an entertaining product. [...] It never broke or raised the bar of its genre, but boasted a high production value, and has been said to be <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> money. The game, however, was an anti-climax {{for those who were}} hooked by the touted and promised initial concepts, many of which were never realized. [...] Freelancer was a [...] "hugely ambitious game", as admitted by Chris Roberts, for a company to develop without the necessary capital and resources.|$|E

Thompson expressed his opinion that Explorers could be compared to the work of science-fiction writers Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. Focusing on the scene in which the Thom(p)sons hair grows rapidly in bright colours, he stated that it provides an abrupt contrast with [...] "the almost scholastic nature of the rest of the story", and that it [...] "injects a few bright splashes" [...] into an otherwise [...] "carefully restrained colour scheme". Philippe Goddin praised the depiction of the rocket's landing as [...] "a magnificent spectacle, <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> double space spread given by Hergé", also highlighting what he perceived as the ending's [...] "unprecedented dramatic tension".|$|E

500|$|Alex Simmons, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell {{reviewed}} the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance for Amiga Action magazine in 1990, {{giving it a}} 79% overall rating. Mitchell preferred the game Champions of Krynn, which had been released {{by the time the}} Amiga version of Pool of Radiance became available; he felt that Pool of Radiance was [...] "more of the same" [...] when compared to Champions, but was less playable and with more limited actions for players. Simmons felt that Pool of Radiance looked primitive and seemed less polished when compared with Champions of Krynn; he felt that although Pool was not up to the standard of Champions, he said it was still [...] "a fine little game". Johns, on the other hand, felt that Pool of Radiance was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> wait, considering it very user-friendly despite being less polished than Champions of Krynn.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power was {{positive}} overall, {{saying that it}} [...] "was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> wait." [...] Jeff Cork of Game Informer was more critical than other reviewers, saying that most {{other aspects of the}} game were let down badly by the control scheme. Edge Magazine {{was positive}} overall, saying that fans of the original Kid Icarus would enjoy the game, praising the way it effectively combined elements from multiple genres. Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine recommended Uprising for hardcore gamers rather than casual gamers, saying it felt deeper than equivalent home console games. Opinions were generally positive on the lighthearted story, in-game dialogue, graphics, several aspects of gameplay, and its multiplayer options. However, a unanimous criticism was the control scheme, which was variously described as difficult or potentially damaging to players' hands, while also creating issues with moving Pit. There were also negative comments about the game's linear structure.|$|E

Wells, a [...] "very small group of writers who have used science fiction as the vehicle of philosophic ideas." [...] William DuBois called the book [...] "a first rate tour de force that is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> attention of every thoughtful citizen {{in this age of}} anxiety." [...] Don Guzman of the Los Angeles Times admired the novel for its suspense, wisdom, and beauty. He compared Clarke's role as a writer to that of an artist, [...] "a master of sonorous language, a painter of pictures in futuristic colors, a Chesley Bonestell with words".

He also highlighted Frizzi's work on the score, and summed the film up as [...] "a real influence on what followed". Anne Billson, writing for The Daily Telegraph in 2013, included Zombi 2 in her list of the top ten zombie films, describing its opening scenes as [...] "sublimely creepy" [...] and the eye-gouging scene as [...] "memorably nasty".

500|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament {{was well}} received. Critics were {{impressed}} with the J-Cart and the extra tracks and vehicles. Mark Patterson of Computer and Video Games praised the Mega Drive version's J-Cart enabling more than two players without extra hardware, and described the game as [...] "bloody brilliant!". Edge reviewer commented that the extra vehicles, tracks, and game modes increase re-playability of both single-player and multiplayer. The reviewers of GamesMaster lauded its addictiveness and commented that it is amongst the best or highest-rated games they have played. A reviewer from Mean Machines Sega believed the game exceeded their expectations, and echoed other opinions by praising the re-playability provided by the extra levels and vehicles. [...] reviewer eulogised the animation, saying it lacks slowdown, and playability. Reviewers from Sega Magazine were highly positive: Richard Leadbetter and Tom Guise lauded the multiplayer mode, saying it is [...] "untouchable".

[...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Phil Freeman {{said that}} the album, which he gave 4 out of 5 stars, was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> wait after {{the amount of time}} it took to get released, and that the stylistic variety of material, {{combined}} with the cover art (which bore a striking resemblance to that of The Resistance, also released that year), could make Priestess [...] "retro hard rock's answer to Muse". Rock Sound made a favorable comparison to Thin Lizzy for the track [...] "Lunar", and to Baroness for [...] "The Gem", giving the album a score of 9 out of 10. The PRP described the album as [...] "heavier" [...] than Hello Master, with its songs having [...] "an alarming amount of depth", but referred to the track [...] "Murphy's Law" [...] as [...] "questionable" [...] in an otherwise favorable review which gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. Artrocker's Stuart Gadd also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, as he enjoyed the stylistic reminders of Iron Maiden and other classic metal he heard on the album, and went as {{far as to say that}} despite being released in early 2010 it was already the best metal record of the year.
