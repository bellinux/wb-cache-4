5|$|In late 1809, a MrJ. Drakard {{released}} The life of that <b>wonderful</b> <b>and</b> extraordinary heavy man, {{the late}} Danl. Lambert, from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something <b>wonderful,</b> <b>and</b> judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E
5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a <b>wonderful</b> <b>and</b> most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E

25|$|In 1910–11 she {{organised}} {{an opera}} season {{of her own}} at the Savoy Theatre, singing Orfeo in English. According to Henry Wood, her training of the chorus to project the diction into the auditorium was <b>wonderful</b> <b>and</b> inscrutable. This season was conducted by Frank Bridge. In 1912 she toured the provinces with the Denhof Opera Company. After this she retired from the stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the vessel provide a {{haunting}} and fascinating dive for anybody who ventures onto the site, the large boilers and {{remains of the}} bow and stern also create a unique and interesting dive. The remains are such that one only has to have little knowledge of the vessel to understand what features are present. On top of this, the site is significant simply as a dive site, the abundance of marine life that are present and the features provide a <b>wonderful</b> <b>and</b> popular dive.|$|E

25|$|Master Sergeant Woodrow W.

Keeble's legacy is a great source of pride for his family, his fellow Dakota Sioux, and all Americans. The Secretary of the Army's recommendation is <b>wonderful</b> <b>and</b> long-awaited news. I began working with Master Sergeant Keeble's family and tribal officials on resolving this long overdue issue in the spring of 2002, and I will continue to work with Defense officials to ensure that this legendary soldier receives the final and most distinguished honor he deserves.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Ant {{released}} the album, Wonderful. The title track {{was a successful}} single, as was {{a tour of the}} U.S. in support of the album. While Ant and his group (which retained longtime guitarist Pirroni) played in smaller venues than they had played in the 1980s, the houses were often packed with enthusiastic fans. The tour was cut short due to Ant and Pirroni both contracting glandular fever. Ant also played three shows at Shepherds Bush Empire in London and did a mini tour of Virgin Record Shops playing selected tunes from the album <b>Wonderful</b> <b>and</b> signing records. Adam and his band also played shows in Dublin, Glasgow, Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent.|$|E

She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some <b>wonderful</b> <b>and</b> thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was <b>wonderful</b> <b>and</b> she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

500|$|In late 1890 at a friend's {{house on}} Lake George in upstate New York, while {{recovering}} from a near-fatal case of jungle fever contracted in Honduras, Savage wrote a tale loosely based on his life, entitled My Official Wife.
