500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, {{said that}} he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings"). [...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E

Sometimes in my dreams that face in the darkness comes back to me, and his half-closed eyelids and shifting, blinky eyes are turned towards me in his sidelong fashion, until I find myself sitting up and holding out my hand into empty space, half expecting to feel another thin sinewy hand close round it. A bad man he was in many ways, my dears, cunning and wily, with little scruple or conscience; and yet so strange a thing is human nature, and so difficult is it for us to control our feelings, that my heart warms <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think of him, and that fifty years have increased rather than weakened the kindliness which I hear to him.|$|R

40|$|How and <b>when</b> {{and where}} <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Jerome Frank <b>I</b> can not now recall. The place was New Haven or New York or Washington; the time, the {{beginning}} of the thirties; the occasion, gone beyond my recollection. But such vagaries are of no importance; for his was the kind of personality which asserts itself before his presence is noted. In speech or in print his words have a pervasive quality; his stream of ideas mingled with that of the hearer or reader and something emerged which initially neither had in mind. I can think of no one whose literate output has been more fungible. Jerome Frank was a person one seemed always to have known and one who, for me, could never disappear from the scene. <b>I</b> <b>first</b> heard of him some time in the twenties. He was described to me by a colleague as 2 ̆ 2 our sort of a practicing lawyer 2 ̆ 2 -whatever these two amorphous terms may mean. He had become adept at the art of advocacy without ceasing to be the intellectual adventurer. Rumor had it that he was a superb technician and yet was master of his arsenal of techniques. He had the knack of putting a case within its setting, of finding within its framework novel issues and of operating alike upon the levels of legal law, industrial fact and public policy. <b>When</b> later <b>I</b> had an opportunity to observe and appraise his craftsmanship, the evidence proved the hearsay...|$|R

'Thrice the Shadows of the Vision warned Allan in his sleep,' he went on; 'and thrice those Shadows have been {{embodied}} in the after-time by You and by Me! You, and no other, stood in the Woman's place at the pool. I, and no other, stood in the Man's place at the window.

There is a curse on our lives! there is a fatality in our footsteps! Allan's future depends on his separation from us at once and forever. Drive him from the place we live in, and the air we breathe. Force him among strangers--the worst and wickedest of them will be more harmless to him than we are!

I felt too glad {{to be able to}} make any atonement for past disobedience; and, denied as I had been all endearments of relationship in my early days, my heart yearned towards a father, who, in his age and helplessness, had thrown himself entirely on me for comfort. My passion for Bianca gained daily more force from absence; by constant meditation it wore itself a deeper and deeper channel. I made no new friends nor acquaintances; sought none of the pleasures of Naples which my rank and fortune threw open to me. Mine was a heart that confined itself to few objects, but dwelt upon those with the intenser passion. To sit by my father, and administer to his wants, and to meditate on Bianca in the silence of his chamber, was my constant habit. Sometimes I amused myself with my pencil in portraying the image that was ever present to my imagination. I transferred to canvas every look and smile of hers that dwelt in my heart. I showed them to my father in hopes of awakening an interest in his bosom for the mere shadow of my love; but he was too far sunk in intellect to take any more than a child-like notice of them.|$|R
