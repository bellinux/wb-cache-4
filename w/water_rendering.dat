25|$|Bluehole {{planned to}} port {{the game to}} consoles, which will be {{released}} sometime following {{the completion of the}} Windows release, with the company already having a team starting on the Xbox One port. Greene was part of Microsoft's press conference during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 to announce that Battlegrounds would be coming to Xbox One as a timed console exclusive sometime by the end of 2017. Kim says they anticipate using the Xbox Game Preview early access approach to roll out and test the game on the Xbox One console. Initially, Greene said that Microsoft was not directly involved in the porting but only providing assistance to make sure the port is good, and that most of the porting responsibilities are being done by Anticto, a Spanish developer. However, at Gamescom that year, Bluehole affirmed that Microsoft Studios would be publishing the Xbox One version of the title, helping to make a planned 2017 release for this version. Greene said that Microsoft's support has helped in several ways, not only for the Xbox One version but improving the performance and security of the Windows version. Further, by being part of the group of studios under the Microsoft banner, {{they have been able to}} talk and incorporate technology from other developers, such as improved <b>water</b> <b>rendering</b> techniques they obtained from Rare that they had developed for Sea of Thieves. The Xbox One release will initially start as an early access title in the Xbox Game Preview program on December 12, 2017, and when finalized, will include a physical release alongside digital availability, and will be released on December 12, 2017.|$|E

60|$|It is usual to keep {{passengers}} below as much {{as possible}} in such circumstances, but the position of the schooner, with her bow high on a bank, and her stern deep in the <b>water,</b> <b>rendered</b> a different course needful on this occasion.|$|R

60|$|At Rhodes {{they had}} taken on board a dozen bucket-loads of earth. The night before, some of these had been emptied into a large tub, which was then filled up with water and stirred briskly, after which the sailors had gone aloft and wetted the sails with muddy <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> their {{appearance}} dingy in the extreme. Here and there white patches had been left, which gave the sails the appearance of being old and recently mended, and with the yards set at different angles and slackened rigging, the Tigress {{would not have been}} recognized as the smart craft that had, twenty-four hours before, sailed from Rhodes. The sailors were all in high glee. After the hard work they had had at Acre they looked upon this as a holiday, and entered with the greatest zest into the work of disguising the ship.|$|E
60|$|The {{night had}} now become so dark as to render objects, without {{the reach of}} the light of the fire, not only indistinct, but in most cases invisible. For a little {{distance}} the water was discernible, glistening, as the glare from the fire danced over its surface, touching it here and there with red quivering streaks; but, at a hundred feet from the shore, there lay a boundary of impenetrable gloom. One or two stars were shining through the openings of the clouds, and the lights were seen in the village, glimmering faintly, as if at an immeasurable distance. At times, as the fire lowered, or as the horizon cleared, the outline of the mountain, {{on the other side of}} the lake, might be traced by its undulations; but its shadow was cast, wide and dense, on the bosom of the <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> the darkness in that direction trebly deep.|$|E

They were nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies next {{to the bottom of}} the sea; and they are from one to eight inches thick. They crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. It is when the sun has the most power on the <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> it tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so shallow that, on the tide's receding, they are left dry, exposed to the beat of the sun. But they do not bring forth their young in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water. They feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce the coral.|$|E
60|$|He {{moved about}} {{from place to}} place in that slow leaning fashion which the {{resistance}} of <b>water</b> <b>renders</b> unavoidable, but he found nothing whatever to repay him for his trouble. There were beams and twisted iron-work, and overturned guns, and a few bales, but nothing that bore the least resemblance to boxes or bags of money.|$|R
60|$|Although {{the engines}} of the crab were of {{enormous}} power, the progress made was slow, for the Adamant was being towed stern foremost. It {{would have been}} easier to tow the great vessel had the crab been attached to her bow, but a ram which extended many feet under <b>water</b> <b>rendered</b> it dangerous for a submerged vessel to attach itself in its vicinity.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{depletion}} {{forces to}} initiate flocculation {{is a common}} process in water treatment. The relatively small size of dispersed particles in waste <b>water</b> <b>renders</b> typical filtration methods ineffective. However, if the dispersion was to be destabilized and flocculation occur, particles can then be filtered out to produce pure water. Therefore, coagulants and flocculants are typically introduced to waste water which create these depletion forces between the dispersed particles.|$|R
6000|$|On the North Sea, Sept. 15. Posted at Copenhagen, Sept. 16, [...] 1883.—Mr. Gladstone {{presents}} his humble duty to your Majesty, and [...] has {{to offer}} his humble apology for not having sought from your [...] Majesty the usual gracious permission before setting foot on a [...] foreign shore. He embarked on the 8th in a steamer of the Castles [...] Company {{under the auspices of}} Sir Donald Currie, with no more [...] ambitious expectation than that of a cruise among the Western [...] Isles. But the extraordinary solidity, so to call it, of a very [...] fine ship (the Pembroke Castle, 4000 tons, 410 feet long) on the [...] <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> her in no small degree independent of weather, [...] encouraged his fellow-voyagers, and even himself, though a most [...] indifferent sailor, to extend their views, and the vessel is now [...] on the North Sea running over to Christiansand in Norway, from [...] whence it is proposed to go to Copenhagen, with the expectation, [...] however, of again touching British soil in the middle of next [...] week. Mr. Gladstone humbly trusts that, under these circumstances, [...] his omission may be excused.|$|E
6000|$|The toil of the ascent, however, did not commence, {{until the}} boats entered {{what was called}} the creek, or the small {{tributary}} of the Unadilla, on which the beavers had erected their works, and which ran through the [...] "Manor." [...] Here, indeed, the progress was slow and laborious, the rapidity of the current and the shallowness of the <b>water</b> <b>rendering</b> every foot gained a work of exertion and pain. Perseverance and skill, notwithstanding, prevailed; all the boats reaching the foot of the rapids, or straggling falls, on which the captain had built his mills, about an hour before the sun disappeared. Here, of course, the boats were left, a rude road having been cut, by means of which the freights were transported on a sledge the remainder of the distance. Throughout the whole of this trying day, Joel had not only worked head-work, but he had actually exerted himself with his body. As for Mike, never before had he made such desperate efforts. He felt all the disgrace of his adventure on the lake, and was disposed to wipe it out by his exploits on the rivers. Thus Mike was ever loyal to his employer. He had sold his flesh and blood for money, and a man of his conscience was inclined to give a fair penny's-worth. The tractable manner in which the boat had floated down the river, it is true, caused him some surprise, as was shown in his remark to the younger Pliny, on landing.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a lovely}} night, and Mademoiselle Viefville and Eve walked the deck for exercise, the {{smoothness}} of the <b>water</b> <b>rendering</b> the moment every way favourable. As has been already said, the common feeling in the escape of the new-married couple had broken the ice, and less restraint existed between the passengers, {{at the moment when}} Mr. Grab left the ship, than would have been the case {{at the end of a}} week, under ordinary circumstances. Eve Effingham had passed her time since her eleventh year principally on the continent of Europe, and in the mixed intercourse that is common to strangers in that part of the world; or, in other words, equally without the severe restraint that is usually imposed there on the young of her own sex, or without the extreme license that is granted to them at home. She came of a family too well toned to run into the extravagant freedoms that sometimes pass for easy manners in America, had she never quitted her father's house even: but her associations abroad had unavoidably imparted greater reserve to her ordinary deportment than the simplicity of cis-Atlantic usages would have rendered indispensable in the most, fastidious circles. With the usual womanly reserves, she was natural and unembarrassed in her intercourse with the world, and she had been allowed to see so many different nations, that she had obtained a self-confidence that did her no injury, under the influence of an exemplary education, and great natural dignity of mind. Still, Mademoiselle Viefville, notwithstanding she had lost some of her own peculiar notions on the subject, by having passed so many years in an American family, was a little surprised at observing that Eve received the respectful advances of Mr. Sharp and Mr. Blunt with less reserve than it was usual to her to manifest to entire strangers. Instead of remaining a mere listener, she answered several remarks of the first, and once or twice she even laughed with him openly at some absurdity of the committee of five. The cautious governess wondered, but half disposed to fancy that there was no more than the necessary freedom of a ship in it all,--for, like a true Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Viefville had very vague notions of the secrets of the mighty deep--she permitted it to pass, confiding in the long-tried taste and discretion of her charge. While Mr. Sharp discoursed with Eve, who held her arm the while, she herself had fallen into an animated conversation with Mr. Blunt, who walked at her side, and who spoke her own language so well, that she at first set him down as a countryman, travelling under an English appellation, as a nom de guerre. While this dialogue was at its height of interest--for Paul Blunt discoursed with his companion of Paris and its excellencies with a skill that soon absorbed all her attention, [...] "Paris, ce magnifique Paris," [...] having almost as much influence on the happiness of the governess, as it was said to have had on that of Madame de Stael, Eve's companion dropped his voice to a tone that was rather confidential for a stranger, although it was perfectly respectful, and said,-- ...|$|E

If alabaster with a smooth, polished surface is washed with dishwashing liquid, it will become rough, dull and whiter, losing most of its translucency and lustre. The finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an ornamental stone, especially for ecclesiastical decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls.|$|R

50|$|During {{low tide}} a konnyaku bridge can be crossed, but during high tide the bridge girdle and pier are {{submerged}} by <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> it unusable. Moreover, many are unsafe {{because they are}} narrow, lack hand rails, or have fallen into disrepair. Hence many are slated for demolition and are being replaced by other kinds of bridge. Examples that have been demolished include the Moguri and Hamatakabō bridges.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is mostly}} deserted and {{consists}} of barren tracts of sand dunes covered with thorny bushes. The ridges are irregular and roughly parallel, they rise to a height of about 46 metres and often create valleys. When there is rain these valleys are moist enough to allow cultivation and when not cultivated, grass grows. The extraordinary salinity of the subsoil land and consequent shortage of potable <b>water</b> <b>renders</b> many quite picturesque salt lakes which rarely dry up.|$|R
50|$|Omahangu is the {{principal}} staple crop grown in Oshana, which is suitable for agriculture. However, the soil is exhausted {{over much of the}} central area and requires substantial fertilisation in order to maintain reasonable productivity. Cattle also do well here and herds are extensive. The southern portion of Oshana is an extensive savannah plain stretching as far as the Etosha Pan, but the generally high salinity of soil and <b>water</b> <b>render</b> it unsuitable for grazing or cultivation.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} in November; and the snow lying four or five feet thick in the beaten road on the summit (in other parts the new drift was already deep), the air was {{piercing}} cold.

50|$|For many years, {{the strong}} {{oxidizing}} agent potassium permanganate (KMnO4) {{was used for}} measuring chemical oxygen demand. Measurements were called oxygen consumed from permanganate, rather than the oxygen demand of organic substances. Potassium permanganate's effectiveness at oxidizing organic compounds varied widely, {{and in many cases}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measurements were often much greater than results from COD measurements. This indicated that potassium permanganate was not able to effectively oxidize all organic compounds in <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> it a relatively poor oxidizing agent for determining COD.|$|E

50|$|The 3rd Division used Buffalo amphibious {{vehicles}} {{to move through}} the flooded areas; the <b>water</b> <b>rendered</b> the German field defences and minefields ineffective and isolated their units on islands where they could be picked off, one by one. XXX Corps had rehearsed forest warfare tactics and were able to bring armour forward with them (despite a high rate of damage due to the natural conditions combined with the age of the tanks). The German defences had not anticipated such tactics, so these tanks, including Churchill Crocodile flame-throwers, had great shock value.|$|R
5000|$|Clark is {{best known}} by his hard water tests and by his process for {{softening}} chalk waters.

Atlas used GPU hardware to render a massive terrain block and its textures. This allowed Atlas to scale with faster systems of the future. A shaded <b>water</b> <b>rendering</b> system was implemented with full reflection, refraction, and Fresnel reflection. TGEA incorporated a lighting system based on Torque Lighting Kit, including a light manager tool, scene lighting, and dynamic shadows among others.|$|E
50|$|Extreme {{fire hazard}} with any {{significant}} amounts of air (oxygen) and spontaneous combustion with <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> sodium leaks and flooding dangerous. This was the case at the Monju Nuclear Power Plant in a 1995 accident and fire. Reactions with water produce hydrogen which can be explosive. Sodium activation product (isotope) 24Na releases dangerous energetic photons when it decays (however {{it has a very}} short half-life of 15 hours). Reactor design keeps 24Na in the reactor pool and carries away heat for power production using a secondary sodium loop, adding costs to construction and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Modern safety {{precautions}} recommend storing picric acid wet. Dry picric acid is relatively sensitive to shock and friction, so laboratories that use it store it in bottles under {{a layer of}} <b>water,</b> <b>rendering</b> it safe. Glass or plastic bottles are required, as picric acid can easily form metal picrate salts that are even more sensitive and hazardous than the acid itself. Industrially, picric acid is especially hazardous because it is volatile and slowly sublimes even at room temperature. Over time, the buildup of picrates on exposed metal surfaces can constitute a grave hazard.|$|E
