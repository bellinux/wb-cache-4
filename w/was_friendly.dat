5|$|Association with Koren – in America, Speyer <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> with John Koren, an American {{statistician}} {{who represented}} the United States on the International Prisons Commission. In 1916, Speyer had funded a fact-finding trip by Koren to Europe, during which Koren visited Germany and met Speyer's sister and friends. Although the committee considered the trip strange, they drew no inference of disloyalty from the events.|$|E
5|$|In Boston, a {{group called}} the Loyal Nine, a {{precursor}} to the Sons of Liberty, organized protests of the Stamp Act. Adams <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> with the Loyal Nine but was not a member. On August 14, stamp distributor Andrew Oliver was hanged in effigy from Boston's Liberty Tree; that night, his home was ransacked and his office demolished. On August 26, lieutenant governor Thomas Hutchinson's home was destroyed by an angry crowd.|$|E

Debora cited basic incompatibility {{as the reason for}} the divorce—"e had absolutely no common interests", she was later quoted as saying—but the divorce <b>was</b> <b>friendly.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tiku {{was born}} near Rantepao in the {{highlands}} of Sulawesi (now part of North Toraja Regency, South Sulawesi) in 1846. At the time, southern Sulawesi was home to a booming coffee trade and controlled by numerous warlords. Tiku {{was the last of}} six children born one of these warlords; he was born to Siambo' Karaeng, lord of Pangala', and his wife Leb'ok. An athletic youth, Tiku <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> with coffee traders who visited his village.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in his {{previous}} congressional term, when Weaver entered the 49th United States Congress, {{he was the only}} Greenback member.

As it had been for years, Weaver's chief concern was with the nation's money and finance, and the relationship between labor and capital.|$|E
5|$|Whether a Native American tribe <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> or warlike was {{critical}} to the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers.|$|E

5|$|William Seward {{was sworn}} in as senator from New York on March 5, 1849, during the brief special session called to confirm President Taylor's cabinet nominees. Seward was seen as having {{influence}} over Taylor: taking advantage of an acquaintance with Taylor's brother. Seward met with the former general several times before Inauguration Day (March 4), and <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> with Cabinet officers. Taylor hoped to gain the admission of California to the Union, and Seward worked to advance his agenda in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Having settled {{these matters}} he {{traveled}} to Cyrrhus, a city in Syria between Antioch and the Euphrates, where he {{spent the rest of}} AD 18 in the winter quarters of the Legion X Fretensis. Evidently here Piso attended Germanicus, and quarreled because he failed to send troops to Armenia when ordered. Artabanus sent an envoy to Germanicus requesting that Vonones be moved further from Armenia as to not incite trouble there. Germanicus complied, moving Vonones to Cilicia, both to please Artabanus and to insult Piso who Vonones <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> with.|$|E
5|$|The consul {{reached the}} Rhotrine Springs {{and he was}} once again met by Seleucus. Seleucus took the injured and sick Romans with him to Apamea as well as {{supplying}} the Romans some guides. They marched for three days after departing from the springs and {{on the third day}} they arrived on the border with the Tolistobogii, one of the three Galatian tribes. The consul held an assembly and addressed his troops about the upcoming war. He then sent envoys to Eposognatus, chieftain of the Tectosagi, the only chieftain who <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> with Pergamum. The envoys returned and replied that the chieftain of the Tectosagi begged the Romans not to invade his territory. He also claimed that he would attempt to force the submission of the other chieftains.|$|E

5|$|Ashbrook was {{defeated}} {{for re-election in}} the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not end until March 4 of the following year. He <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republican–Indiana), and persuaded him to schedule {{a hearing on the}} peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as the redesign involved no expense.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{appointed}} four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The {{first was}} David Josiah Brewer, a {{judge on the}} Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Brewer, the nephew of Justice Field, had previously been considered for a cabinet position. Shortly after Brewer's nomination, Justice Matthews died, creating another vacancy. Harrison had considered Henry Billings Brown, a Michigan judge and admiralty law expert, for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second. For the third vacancy, which arose in 1892, Harrison nominated George Shiras. Shiras's appointment was somewhat controversial because his age—sixty—was older than usual for a newly appointed Justice. Shiras also drew the opposition of Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania {{because they were in}} different factions of the Pennsylvania Republican party, but his nomination was nonetheless approved. Finally, {{at the end of his}} term, Harrison nominated Howell Edmunds Jackson to replace Justice Lamar, who died in January 1893. Harrison knew the incoming Senate would be controlled by Democrats, so he selected Jackson, a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> to ensure his nominee would not be rejected. Jackson's nomination was indeed successful, but he died after only two years on the Court.|$|E
5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting <b>was</b> <b>friendly</b> and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, {{the same way he}} had sounded out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} model of two sociological phenomena: the tendencies to form groups and to favor others who are similar. Individuals divide society into friends and enemies. Individualspayo¤s depend on their own choices and on the choices of others. We assume di¤erent types of complementarities: Other things equal, each {{individual}} prefers to <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> towards those who <b>are</b> <b>friendly</b> toward her (second-degree complementarity) and toward those who <b>are</b> <b>friendly</b> toward those [...] . who <b>are</b> <b>friendly</b> toward her (higher-degree complementarity). With second-degree complementarities, but no higher-degree externalities, individuals want to reciprocate friendship. Any additional amount of higher-degree complementarities pushes individuals to form groups. Next, we assume everybody may make mistakes that make him confuse individuals who are similar to each other. To minimize {{the cost of the}} mistakes, individuals want to keep their friends as di¤erent from their enemies as possible. Combined with group formation, individuals would like to <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> toward others who are similar to them. Although individuals act as if they have preferences for similar others, in reality, their behavior is a best response to the equilibrium behavior of others. 1...|$|R
