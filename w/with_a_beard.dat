5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises himself <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> and monocle and {{assumes a}} new {{identity}} {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to recognize him as Woodruff because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates Woodruff in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard,</b> others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.|$|E

50|$|The {{portrait}} of the king is almost exclusively known from his coinage. It is possible to identify several types of depiction in the coinage. He can be shown <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short <b>beard</b> and <b>a</b> diadem, but there are images which show him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mid-length <b>beard</b> or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long <b>beard,</b> still wearing the diadem. A completely different type of image shows him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high domed tiara on his head.|$|R

25|$|The series spans 50 {{years of}} Quatermain's life, from 18 to 68; {{at the start}} of the {{foundation}} novel King Solomon's Mines, he has just turned 55. Physically, he is small, wiry, and unattractive, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> and short hair that sticks up. His one skill is his marksmanship, where he has no equal. Quatermain is aware that as a professional hunter, he has helped to destroy his beloved wild free places of Africa. In old age he hunts without pleasure, having no other means of making a living.|$|E

25|$|Although some images {{exist at}} the synagogue at Dura-Europos, and such images {{may have been}} common, Judaism in theory forbade images, and its {{influence}} on the depictions of Jesus remains unknown. Christian depictions of the 3rd and 4th centuries typically focused on New Testament scenes of healings and other miracles. Following the conversion of Constantine in the 4th century, Christian art found many wealthy donors and flourished. In this period Jesus began to have more mature features, and was shown <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard.</b> A new development at this time was the depiction of Jesus without a narrative context, but just as a figure by himself.|$|E
25|$|The Saint {{appeared}} in a long-running series starting as a daily comic strip 27 September 1948 with a Sunday added on 20 March the following year. The early strips were written by Leslie Charteris, who had previous experience writing comic strips, having replaced Dashiell Hammett as the writer of the Secret Agent X-9 strip. The original artist was Mike Roy. In 1951, when John Spranger replaced Roy as the artist, he altered The Saint's appearance by depicting him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard.</b> Bob Lubbers illustrated The Saint in 1959 and 1960. The final {{two years of the}} strip were drawn by Doug Wildey before it came to an end on 16 September 1961.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, new {{reports of}} miraculous images of Jesus had {{appeared}} and continue to receive significant attention, e.g. Secondo Pia's 1898 photograph of the Shroud of Turin, {{one of the most controversial}} artifacts in history, which during its May 2010 exposition it was visited by over 2 million people. Another 20th century depiction of Jesus, namely the Divine Mercy image based on Faustina Kowalska's reported vision has over 100 million followers. The first cinematic portrayal of Jesus was in the 1897 film La Passion du Christ produced in Paris, which lasted 5 minutes. Thereafter cinematic portrayals have continued to show Jesus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> in the standard western depiction that resembles traditional images.|$|E

25|$|Up {{to about}} the 17th century Joseph tends to be {{depicted}} as a man advanced in years, with grey hair, often balding, occasionally frail, a comparatively marginal figure alongside Mary and Jesus if not entirely in the background, passive other than when leading them on their flight to Egypt. Joseph is shown mostly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard,</b> not only in keeping with Jewish custom, but also because – although the Gospel accounts do not give his age – later literature tends to present him as an old man {{at the time of}} his wedding to Mary. This depiction arose to allay concerns about both the celibacy of the newly wedded couple, the mention of brothers and sisters of Jesus in the canonical Gospels, and Joseph's other children spoken of in apocryphal literature – concerns discussed very frankly by Jean Gerson for example, who nonetheless favoured showing him as a younger man.|$|E
25|$|The {{fountain}} {{is a large}} granite surface, {{forming an}} elongated backrest, measuring about 3 metres wide and 1.20 metres high. On {{the left of the}} rock is a carved human figure, about 1.10 metres tall, upright, but deteriorated, and possibly male <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard,</b> wrapped in a toga, holding in his left arm a bulky object. It is flanked above by Latin inscription, the first word partially cut into the stone. To the right of the figure (just slightly below) is a rectangular building cut into the rock, about 0.7 metres high, 0.6 metres wide and 0.12 deep, with the worn figure of human head. The little house is crowned by a triangular pediment with a bird engraved into its triangular form, while other Latin inscriptions are engraved into its sides, extending to the base. At the base of this granite structure flows the fountain's water.|$|E
25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

25|$|Luthor {{decides to}} fake {{his own death}} by {{piloting}} a prototype jet on a proposed trip {{around the world and}} crashing it in the Andes; this is merely a cover for the removal of his brain from his cancer-ridden body and the growth of a cloned body around it, whereupon he passes himself off as his hitherto unknown, illegitimate 21-year-old son and heir, Lex Luthor II. His deception is benefited by a vibrant new body <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> and full head of red hair, as well as assuming an Australian accent as part of his fake backstory. As Luthor II, he inherits control of LexCorp and seduces Supergirl (a protoplasmic clone of an alternate universe Lana Lang), due to his resemblance to her creator (the alternate universe's Luthor). Luthor's clone body eventually begins to deteriorate and age (and lose its hair) at a rapid rate, a side-effect of a disease that affects all clones. Meanwhile, Lois Lane discovers proof of Luthor's clone harvesting and false identity; with help from Superman, she exposes the truth, and a despondent Superman helps to apprehend Luthor. In the end, Luthor becomes a permanent prisoner in his own body, unable to even blink, and swearing vengeance on Superman.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Ryan {{learned that}} American Idol judge Simon Cowell was serving as {{executive}} producer {{for an upcoming}} competition titled America's Got Talent, and the tryouts in New York were happening {{on the same day}} as a family outing in the city. Ryan almost left without performing when she looked at the other contestants and saw a lady <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> [...] "probably about, like, two feet long," [...] juggling torches. She decided to stay when her father told her the grand prize was US$1 million.

Lazenby claimed the producers had tried {{to persuade him to}} shave it off to appear like Bond, but at that stage he had already decided not to make another Bond film and rejected the idea. The beard and accompanying shoulder-length hair [...] "strained his already fragile relationship with Saltzman and Broccoli". As On Her Majesty's Secret Service had been filmed in stereo, the first Bond film to use the technology, the Odeon had a new speaker system installed to benefit the new sounds.|$|E

500|$|Steven Moffat, head {{writer of}} the new series, said before {{broadcast}} {{that this would be}} one of the darkest openers to a series ever done for Doctor Who. Director Toby Haynes believed that the darker episodes like [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] and [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] would allow the series to get into [...] "more dangerous territory." [...] The creation of the Silence was partly inspired by the figure from the Edvard Munch painting The Scream. Introducing the alien villains became a [...] "big challenge" [...] for the producers; it would tie in with the loose [...] "silence will fall" [...] arc that carried through the fifth series. Moffat did not wish to end the arc in the previous series, as he felt it would be [...] "more fun" [...] to continue it. Elsewhere in the episode, Delaware was written to be deceptively antagonistic towards the protagonists, which was based on actor Mark Sheppard's past as villains for his work in American television. Moffat was also keen on the idea of having the Doctor imprisoned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> in Area 51. Smith wore a glued-on beard, which was difficult to peel off.|$|E
500|$|The TV show Police Cops is {{a parody}} of the {{television}} series Miami Vice. One of the new TV shows features Archie Bunker in the show All in the Family 1999. Homer suggests the names Hercules Rockefeller, Rembrandt Q. Einstein, and Handsome B. Wonderful to Judge Snyder for his name change. The [...] "Max Power" [...] song is sung to the melody of [...] "Goldfinger", the theme from the James Bond film Goldfinger (1964). Actor Woody Harrelson, President Bill Clinton and producers Lorne Michaels, Brian Grazer and Jerry Bruckheimer are shown in attendance at the party (Grazer's appearance is identical to his guest-voice appearance as himself from [...] "When You Dish Upon a Star", while Bruckheimer, who has not done a voice cameo for the show, is the thin man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> standing next to Grazer and wearing a bright sportcoast over a plain T-shirt). [...] The police attempting to [...] "swab" [...] the protestors is a reference to several incidents in 1997 in which sheriff's deputies of Humboldt County, California, swabbed pepper spray {{in the eyes of}} environmental protesters. Actor Jeremy Piven is mentioned by Homer in this episode who asks the producers of Police Cops [...] "Who's Jeremy Piven?" [...] to which they reply [...] "We don't know".|$|E
500|$|Game {{developer}} studio Namco {{had wanted}} to include a Tekken Force character to the series since Tekken 3. Lars' full name was proposed to the staff by an unknown woman from the Swedish embassy in Japan, years before Tekken 6 was developed. Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada found it [...] "cool" [...] and immediately {{decided to use the}} name. Lars was finally introduced to Tekken 6 in an update titled Bloodline Rebellion. In early sketches, Lars was depicted as older than he appears in the game, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> and a pony tail. Another rejected sketch featured Lars' complete Tekken Force design that covered his entire face and had a bigger cape. Unlike other new Tekken 6 characters who were based on fan input, both Lars and fellow newcomer Alisa Bosconovitch were created using a different approach, focusing on their importance to the game's story. As a result, in the arcade version of Tekken 6, most of Lars' identity was kept a mystery, leaving it to the console versions' Scenario Campaign mode to explain his role in the series, with Harada teasing about his potential attack of Jin Kazama's forces. In response to claims that the story of Tekken was complicated, Harada denied as he saw it as a [...] "simple" [...] struggle between members from the Mishima family and how multiple characters are dragged into this.|$|E
