25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

500|$|Steve Young, {{a writer}} for the Late Show with David Letterman, was brought in as a {{freelance}} writer to write the episode. The writers wanted to explore what made Flanders tick and examine what made him act the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> The original idea came from George Meyer, who had also wanted an episode about Flanders' faith being tested. One of the key story points came from his friend Jack Handey, {{a writer for}} Saturday Night Live, who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him, but make very bad shoes. Likewise, it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders' house, but do a bad job and provoke an outburst.|$|E
500|$|Several new {{actors were}} cast as Samwell Tarly's family in Horn Hill. Samwell's father, Randyll Tarly, had been {{referenced}} {{several times and}} had been described as [...] "cruel" [...] in his treatment of his oldest son. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, John Bradley (Samwell Tarly) spoke about the introduction of his family to the series, stating, [...] "When you see Sam {{with his father and}} mother and brother especially, he starts to make sense. The character is contextualized. Why is his psyche the way it is? Why does he behave the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does?</b> Ever since you first saw him, he comes from this very sincere and heartfelt maternal love, and then there's this monster. You can see why he's so damaged. His emotional life has been pulled in so many different directions. He's so incredibly confused." [...] Actor James Faulkner was cast in the role of Randyll, with Samantha Spiro portraying Samwell's mother and Freddie Stroma and Rebecca Benson portraying Samwell's brother Dickon and sister Talla.|$|E
500|$|The idea of Lisa dating Nelson {{had been}} around for a while, with several {{different}} versions being pitched. The writers wanted a [...] "silly" [...] Homer story to balance the episode out, and the idea of using the telemarketing scam for this had also {{been around for a}} while. By this time, the show had begun to have episodes revolving around secondary characters. This was the first episode to revolve around Nelson, and was done to partly explain why Nelson acts the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> The words to Nelson's song were contributed by Mike Scully's daughters. The scene in which Milhouse passes Lisa's note to Nelson was written by Bill Oakley, with the line, [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze", being George Meyer's line. There was a debate as to how injured Milhouse should look without it looking disturbing, and the drop of blood coming from his nose was decided to be enough. Milhouse liking Vaseline on toast was based on a child from Josh Weinstein's school days who everyday would get onto the bus with a piece of toast, which had Vaseline on it.|$|E

500|$|The writers first {{detailed}} Cane as [...] "a smart, loyal, {{and moral}} survivalist with an edge". Goddard describes Cane as a [...] "typical Australian, working-class {{kind of guy}} who mined opals, raised goats, then went off for travel and adventure to sort of find himself". Global BC penned Cane as [...] "mysterious". SoapNet described Cane as a [...] "pretty stand-up guy", as well as [...] "loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about". The network said his time in Genoa City has [...] "made him a good man". In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", and that he is [...] "very sensitive about that". He also stated that Cane [...] "has no fears in doing business with anybody" [...] because if you can come from a [...] "family of gangsters than business people don’t really measure up". Looking back on Cane's [...] "power jobs", Goddard stated: [...] "I don’t think Cane has the book learning skills side of it, but I think he has the life lessons side of it, based on who he is and where he has come from. The <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> business with people, he kind of understands who they are as people." ...|$|E
500|$|Bellman was a skilful and {{entertaining}} performer of his songs, accompanying {{himself on the}} cittern, putting on different voices, and imitating the sounds made by a crowd of people. He is unusual, even unique, among major poets in {{that almost all of}} his work was [...] "conceived to music". His achievement has been compared to Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth. Bellman, however, was no great playwright, nor a major classical composer. His biographer, Paul Britten Austin, suggests that the comparison with Hogarth is closer to the mark. Bellman had a gift for using elegant classical references in comic contrast to the sordid realities of drinking and prostitution. The <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> this, at once regretting and celebrating these excesses in song, achieves something of what Hogarth achieved in engravings and paint. The art historian Axel Romdahl describes Bellman's sensibility {{as if he had been}} a painter: [...] "An unusual swiftness of apprehension, both optical and aural, must have distinguished him." [...] Britten Austin agrees with this, noting that [...] "When [...] words and music have faded into silence it is the visual image which remains." [...] Jan Sjåvik comments in the Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature and Theater that [...] "Bellman's achievement consists in taking this humble and unrecognized literary form [...] and raising it to a genre that became impossible to ignore, while in the process creating songs and characters that have become an indispensable part of Sweden's literary and cultural heritage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yaakov Kirschen, {{creator of}} the Israeli comic strip Dry Bones, says his {{cartoons}} are designed to make people laugh, which makes them drop their guard and see things the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> In an interview, he defined his objective as a cartoonist {{as an attempt to}} [...] "seduce rather than to offend." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Most {{likely he}} thought things were growing {{too hot for}} him," [...] was Phil's comment, when the boys talked the matter over.

2500|$|On July 13, 2011, a {{controversial}} magazine article titled [...] "James Harrison: Confessions of an NFL Hitman" [...] {{was published by}} Paul Solotaroff in Men's Journal. In the article, Harrison was asked multiple questions about {{who he is and}} why he plays the game of football the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> The controversy comes into play when Harrison begins talking about the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Harrison called Goodell a [...] "crook and a puppet", and then proceeded to say that [...] "I hate him and will never respect him." [...] Harrison also made comments towards his quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, and other players in the National Football League such as Brian Cushing. Harrison released an apology for his statements on July 14, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Souter {{elaborated}} on {{two reasons}} why an adjustment {{in line with}} the Pickering balancing test would be feasible in this instance. First, the extent of the public employer's authority over speech can be predetermined in advance to set up a barrier of sorts that the employee engaging in speech would have to overcome. In this way, the employee speaking on matters {{in the course of his}} employment would not be able to overcome the barrier unless he speaks [...] "on a matter of unusual importance and satisfies high standards of responsibility in the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it." [...] Additionally, should the incorporation of such a standard fail to discourage meritless action, the matter would get resolved at the summary-judgment level.|$|E
2500|$|Suffering from {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, it was {{too painful}} for Bowden to signal a batsman out in the conventional fashion, with a straight index finger raised above the head, and {{this led to the}} [...] "crooked finger of doom". He has also put his own slant on several other signals, including a [...] "crumb-sweeping" [...] wave of the arm to signal four, and the [...] "double crooked finger six-phase hop" [...] to signal a six. His signals are sedate in Tests, more flashy in ODIs and decidedly flamboyant in Twenty20. His behavior has attracted him both fans and critics almost equally. Martin Crowe referred to him as Bozo the Clown, and at least one commentator has said he should remember that cricket is for the players and fans, not for the umpires. However, there was a suggestion that he needs to do the signals in the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> because of his arthritis, as he needs to keep his body fluid.|$|E

2500|$|Gordon Dahlquist of The Kubrick FAQ {{argues that}} the name change [...] "deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous {{situation}} {{and the man who}} has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may {{have had a chance to}} escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to." [...] Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; [...] "I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [...] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'." ...|$|E
