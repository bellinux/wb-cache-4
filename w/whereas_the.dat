5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem while preserving their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δr, the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δr, <b>whereas</b> <b>the</b> radius of its externally tangent given circles must be changed by −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell in tandem, <b>whereas</b> <b>the</b> externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E
