5000|$|In 1996, George Washington University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg {{presented}} this bronze statue {{as a gift}} to the University's Class of 2000. The hippo {{stands with}} its mouth wide. Its nose is slightly <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> passerby <b>rubbing</b> it. A plaque is placed on the base: ...|$|R
50|$|Fights {{occur for}} dominance, {{in which the}} bulls lock horns and try to twist the necks of their opponents. As an act during rut, the males rub their foreheads in fresh urine or mud. They also use their horns to thresh and throw loose earth on themselves. The horns of older males get <b>worn</b> out <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> them on tree barks. Expressions of anger are not {{typically}} observed. Dominant males may mate with multiple females. The courtship is brief, consisting of a penetration and one ejaculatory thrust.|$|R
50|$|The major {{complication}} or {{the most}} important one is corneal ulcer occurring <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> by concentrations, or trichiasis with superimposed bacterial infection.|$|R
5000|$|Any {{condition}} {{that causes the}} eyes to itch can contribute <b>to</b> darker circles <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> or scratching the skin around them. Hay fever sufferers in particular will notice under-eye [...] "smudges" [...] {{during the height of}} the allergy season.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Dragonfly {{in perfect}} working {{condition}} but showing <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> numerous crashes ...|$|R
50|$|Sheets of Braille were {{coated with}} shellac {{to help protect}} them from <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> being read by hand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lightness}} {{of the structure}} means it is more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> water vibrations than more massive dams ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The nose of {{the statue}} of Warner Bentley is {{discolored}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> students <b>rubbing</b> it.|$|R
50|$|Ireland {{is rich in}} menhirs, {{standing}} stones {{which are}} usually located in farmer's fields and are heavily <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> poor weather conditions and exposure to livestock.|$|R
50|$|In clothing, static cling occurs from static electricity, {{which is}} usually <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> as in a clothes dryer (the triboelectric effect). It is {{especially}} noticeable when humidity is low, allowing static electricity to build up. Certain substances can reduce static cling and are often included in fabric softener and dryer sheets. Antistatic agents, which make the surfaces slightly conductive, {{can be used on}} fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Australian rules {{has evolved}} to have {{sleeveless}} jumpers, whereas Gaelic footballers wear short sleeved outfits similar to soccer or rugby tops. Long sleeves (usually <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> cold weather) are acceptable in both codes.|$|R
40|$|Ceramics {{have a high}} {{strength}} and are chemically stable materials, however they are often not used because extreme <b>wear</b> is feared <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their brittle nature. Therefore a model has been derived, predicting the transition of mild <b>to</b> severe <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> thermally induced stresses (Metselaar et al. 1999) : The temperature rise <b>due</b> <b>to</b> frictional heating in a tribological contact induces thermal stresse...|$|R
5000|$|Fine (F) - Paper is now {{slightly}} soft, considerable <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> folds from use in circulation. Minor {{tears to}} note, not extending into the design. Clear but not bright in appearance. Staple holes but not holes <b>due</b> <b>to</b> folding.|$|R
40|$|A {{second stage}} stator blade and three sixth stage rotor blades were {{recovered}} from the wreckage of an aircraft accident. The stator blade had a nick and this damage was <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> action of another object. Soot had deposited on the rotor blades {{but not in the}} regions where the blades were overlapping. This indicates that the deposition of soot should have occurred after the blades got bent, i. e, after the accident...|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the castle}} saw its {{usefulness}} decline. Townspeople neglected to maintain proper {{of the castle}} and the fortress slowly <b>wore</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the force of nature. The castle is mostly in ruins with a few left standing.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Circular rock carving. (Approx. 1 metre diameter.) There {{are several}} of these, some badly <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> tourist traffic. The Incas {{believed}} that the puma engraved on the rock represented the priesthood or the power of God.|$|R
50|$|If {{chemosis}} {{has occurred}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> excessive <b>rubbing</b> of the eye, the first aid {{to be given}} is a cold water wash for eyes.|$|R
50|$|Surgical scrubs are not {{generally}} {{owned by the}} <b>wearer.</b> <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> concerns about home laundering and sterility issues, these scrubs are usually hospital-owned or hospital-leased through a commercial linen service. And <b>due</b> <b>to</b> these laundering and sterility limitations, disposable scrub suits were introduced in the market.|$|R
50|$|Unlike some {{collectible}} toys, Breyer horse packaging {{does not}} generally affect the model's value. Unfortunately, {{there have been}} some issues with pre-2000s packaging, in which if a model is left in the box {{for an extended period of}} time, the box can actually cause harm to the horse's finish <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> of the horse's paint on the sides of the box or on the plastic ties binding it to the packaging, therefore diminishing the model's value.|$|R
2500|$|Camshaft {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to crankshaft main bearings, being pressure-fed with oil. [...] However, overhead camshaft bearings do not always have replaceable bearing shells, meaning that a new cylinder head is required if the bearings suffer <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> insufficient or dirty oil.|$|R
50|$|This crater {{is roughly}} circular, with an outer rim {{that has been}} {{slightly}} <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> minor impacts. The northwestern rim in particular has merged with a smaller crater, and another impact lies on the interior floor along the west-northwestern inner wall.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the well {{contains}} several large windows arranged regularly. It was possible to draw water from the well to every floor, and {{there is evidence of}} <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the ropes in several locations, but especially on the third floor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, after over 300 {{years in the}} church of Matara, the statue looked faded and <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{exposure}} and the thousands of devotees touching and kissing it. Arrangements were made with a sculptor in Ghent, Belgium, to renovate the statue.|$|R
50|$|The outer rim of this crater has {{undergone}} some <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> impact erosion. Still the inner walls possess some terrace structures {{along the southern}} edge. A small crater overlays the northern rim, {{and a pair of}} tiny craters line along the eastern edge.|$|R
5000|$|Kundt is a small, bowl-shaped lunar {{impact crater}} in the {{northern}} section of the Mare Nubium. It has a raised rim and is not significantly <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> impact erosion. This crater lies part way between Guericke {{to the west and}} Davy in the east.|$|R
40|$|Rubbing-induced {{lignification}} in Bryonia dioica internodes {{is significantly}} impaired by N(o-hydroxyphenyl) and N(o-aminophenyl) sulfinamoyl tertiobutyl acetate, specific inhibitors of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, an enzyme which is strictly associated with lignin monomer synthesis. Along with {{the reduction of}} lignification, these inhibitors counteract the inhibition of elongation <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing.</b> These results indicate that lignification participates in the thigmomorphogenetic growth response of Bryonia dioica internodes. In a general way, the data point to the causal role of lignification in the limitation of plant growth...|$|R
50|$|Cylindrical {{thrust roller}} {{bearings}} consist of small cylindrical rollers arranged flat with their axes {{pointing to the}} axis of the bearing. They give very good carrying capacity and are cheap, but tend <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the differences in radial speed and friction which is higher than with ball bearings.|$|R
40|$|Teeth erosion in Caucasian males is {{a fairly}} rare {{condition}} and the pathosis afflicts more females than males in Western Countries. This is a case report of a 22 year old male with pathological teeth <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> anorexia bulimia. He was treated using Tanaka'scopper oxide treatment to cast gold veneers...|$|R
50|$|PBT {{can also}} be made into yarn. This has a natural stretch similar to Lycra and can be {{incorporated}} into sports <b>wear.</b> <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> its chlorine resistance it is commonly found in swimwear. Further, recent studies have shown that PBT has superior UV properties to PET based fabrics such as T400.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} liquid {{sulfidation}} {{has also been}} used in the manufacturing of diamond-like carbon films. These films are generally used to coat surfaces <b>to</b> reduce the <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> friction. The inclusion of sulfidation in the process has been shown to reduce the friction coefficient of the dlc film.|$|R

50|$|Severe skin {{irritation}} is physically apparent, with reddening of non-pigmented and unprotected areas. This subsequently leads <b>to</b> itch and <b>rubbing,</b> followed by further inflammation, exudation, and scab formation. Lesions and inflammation that occur {{are said to}} resemble the conditions seen in foot and mouth disease. Sheep have been observed to have face swelling, dermatitis, and wool falling off <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubbing.</b> Lactating animals may cease or have reduced milk production; pregnant animals may abort. Lesions on udders are often apparent. Horses may show signs of anorexia, depression (with a comatose state), dilated pupils, and injected conjunctiva.|$|R
50|$|Segers {{is unusual}} in that all of its {{satellite}} craters have a larger diameter. It is roughly circular in outline, with a bowl-shaped interior. The rim is not significantly <b>worn</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> impact erosion, and the edge remains sharp. The inner wall has a relatively high albedo, giving the crater a bright appearance.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{the test}} {{work on the}} TBRC had shown {{that it had a}} high rate of {{refractory}} <b>wear,</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the washing action of the slag caused by the rotation of the furnace, which provided additional pressure to develop an alternate process. The TBRC test work also resulted in low oxygen utilization (about 60%).|$|R
50|$|Carbon nanocones {{have been}} used to cap {{ultrafine}} gold needles. Such needles are widely used in scanning probe microscopy owing to their high chemical stability and electrical conductivity, but their tips are prone <b>to</b> mechanical <b>wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the high plasticity of gold. Adding a thin carbon cap mechanically stabilizes the tip without sacrificing its other properties.|$|R
50|$|In 1876, Thomas Ridley Oswald, a {{shipbuilder}} from Sunderland, {{closed his}} yard on the River <b>Wear</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> financial difficulties {{and opened a}} new shipyard {{on the banks of}} the River Itchen, Hampshire at Woolston. In 1878 he formed a partnership with John Henry Mordaunt of Warwick, changing the name of the business to Oswald Mordaunt and Company.|$|R
