25|$|There is {{controversy}} in the academic world though as to <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> {{the topic of the}} machinations of the Gallo-Romano Aristocracy after the death of Avitus who was of Gallic origin and from amongst their own ranks. Many scholars old and new have either read the name of the event Marcellini, Marcelliniana instead of Marcellana. This does not make much sense to place Marcellinus as the person in question for this action of the Gallic aristocracy since he is not Gallic and most likely comes from a wealthy Dalmatian family. The assumption to place Marcellinus as the person being spoken of has only led others to assume then that he is Gallic in origin when there is absolutely no evidence to support this. Mathisen has shown that Marcellinus cannot be the person in question and that Apollinaris Sidonius was speaking of a Marcellus, who was a Gallic aristocrat. He demonstrates why Marcellinus cannot logically be the person in question by comparing other names written by the same author and showing that Sidonius using the same style in writing the names thus giving the support it is Marcellus not Marcellinus he speaks of.|$|E
500|$|In Present-day Boston, Emma Swan (Morrison) lives {{a lonely}} {{existence}} {{working as a}} bail bondsman and bounty hunter. She is approached by a ten-year-old boy, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who identifies himself as her son, whom she had given up for adoption as a teenager. Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma agrees to drive {{him back to his}} home in Storybrooke, Maine. Along the way, Henry shows her a large book of fairy tales he has, insisting that all of the stories in it are real. When they arrive in Storybrooke, Henry informs her that everyone in town is in reality a fairy tale character, exiled by the curse and with no memory of their real identities. This includes his therapist Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Jiminy Cricket, and his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Snow White. Henry claims that time is frozen in Storybrooke and the people are unable to leave, but that the curse will be broken by Emma. A skeptical Emma returns Henry to his adopted mother, the town Mayor, Regina (Parrilla), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the Evil Queen. Emma attempts to leave but after having drunk apple cider given to her by the Mayor and nearly hitting a wolf she has a car accident where she is knocked out. She is arrested and taken to Storybrooke Jail. When Henry runs away again, Emma makes a deal with the Mayor and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan): if they release her, she will find him. After exhausting all possibilities she speaks with Mary Margaret, who tells Emma to [...] "Check his castle." [...] After finding Henry at a wooden jungle gym (which bears a resemblance to Prince Charming's castle), they talk and Emma decides to stay in Storybrooke temporarily, especially after Regina warns her to leave town. This leads Emma to be suspicious of the mayor's motives.|$|E

Trudel tells Palin to hold on for a moment while he gives the phone to Sarkozy, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Audette.

When the real Mulder (David Duchovny) finds the wrecked hotel room, his sister Samantha {{explains}} that the Bounty Hunter will set up a hostage exchange to swap Scully for her. She further {{explains that the}} Bounty Hunter can only be killed by piercing {{the base of his}} neck, and that his toxic alien blood is deadly to humans. Finally, Samantha reveals that the clones are the progeny of two original aliens, and worked at abortion clinics to gain access to fetal tissue. Their objective was to set up an extraterrestrial colony on Earth, an effort that has gone {{as far back as the}} 1940s. However, because the clones' experiments were considered to have tainted their alien race, the Bounty Hunter was sent to kill them.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Lana Lang is {{characterized}} as the girl next door. As Kreuk describes her, she is the [...] "beautiful, popular girl <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> lonely". She has a [...] "hole in her heart", because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. Kristin feels that deep down the character is a [...] "tough girl", and that Lex manages to bring that side of her out more. For instance, he convinces her to fight back against a rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon – the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, that tough side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark. Kreuk thinks that Lana [...] "lived in her head a little bit"; she was intelligent enough to read classical books, but would also read romantic novels [...] "on the sly".|$|E
500|$|Blackwoods actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings. Tracy {{claimed that}} [...] " [...] doesn't really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical {{attitude}} can't ignore {{the truth of}} the situation they're all in." [...] Perry defined the role as [...] "someone <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her." [...] Her casting was assessed by Perry as [...] "full of energy" [...] and [...] "embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [...] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike so much that you don't understand why she is the way she is." [...] Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd (Rachel Todd in You, Me and the Kids) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk (Kyle Morgan in Once Upon a Christmas) as her son Tim Carpenter, David Paetkau (Hunter Kerrigan in Just Deal) as gambler Evan Lewis, Justina Machado (Vanessa Diaz in Six Feet Under) as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and Noel Fisher (Todd Tolanski of [...] ) as farmer Brian Gibbons. Novice actors Sarah Carter, Alejandro Rae, and Shaun Sipos were hired as Kimberly's friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman correspondingly. Andrew Airlie portrayed Kimberly's father Michael Corman, while Enid-Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian.|$|E

500|$|Like many of Keats's odes, [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] {{discusses}} art and art's audience. He {{relied on}} depictions of natural music in earlier poems, and {{works such as}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual. Keats reverses this when describing an urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] to focus on representational art. He previously used {{the image of an}} urn in [...] "Ode on Indolence", depicting one with three figures representing Love, Ambition and Poesy. Of these three, Love and Poesy are integrated into [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] with an emphasis on how the urn, as a human artistic construct, is capable of relating to the idea of [...] "Truth". The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities: an attempt at courtship, the making of music, and a religious rite. The figures are supposed to be beautiful, and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic. Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator, the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images. The narrator interacts with the urn {{in a manner similar to}} how a critic would respond to the poem, which creates ambiguity in the poem's final lines: [...] "'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." [...] The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> speaking these words, to whom they are speaking, and what is meant by the words, which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} case, Apollo is {{selected}} {{to serve as}} the defense in an experimental jury trial organized by Phoenix. His client, professional forger Vera Misham, is accused of poisoning her father Drew. After Vera succumbs to poison while testifying, the player is instructed by Phoenix to investigate the circumstances leading to the case. Seven years earlier, while representing magician Zak Gramarye in court, Phoenix was tricked into using false evidence created by Vera, costing him his reputation and job. Zak subsequently disappeared, leaving his daughter Trucy in Phoenix's custody. Over the years, Phoenix uses his experience and connections to gradually uncover the truth: Trucy and Apollo are half-siblings gifted with a unique power of perception by their mother, Thalassa Gramarye. Furthermore, Zak was forced to abandon Trucy, his daughter, in order to honor the wishes of her grandfather, who passed the legal rights to his magic to her side of the family. It also transpires that Zak is Shadi Smith, the victim in the first case, who had come to give the rights to Magnifi's magic to Trucy before being killed by Kristoph when the latter recognized him. The whole matter takes a surprise turn when Kristoph is summoned to testify and Apollo accuses him for setting up Phoenix out of jealousy and then killing everyone related to the case out of fear of being found out. Following the final arguments, the player takes control of a member of Phoenix's jury and must decide whether or not Vera is guilty. If [...] "Not Guilty" [...] is chosen, then she is declared innocent by unanimous vote and ultimately recovers from the poison. With his name cleared, Phoenix decides to apply for readmission to the bar and assures Lamiroir, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Thalassa in disguise, that he will watch over Apollo and Trucy. If [...] "Guilty" [...] is chosen, it triggers an alternate ending in which a hung jury forces the court with no choice but to delay the verdict. Vera's sudden death occurs soon after, resulting in an uncertain future for the Wright Anything Agency.|$|E
