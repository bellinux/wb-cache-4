500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Little X and features cameo appearances by Keri Hilson, Bria Myles, Sean Faris and Justin Timberlake. It does not follow a storyline and per Furtado's request, focuses on scenes with dancing and flirting {{because she wanted to}} recreate the song's indicative vibe, and took the opportunity to film a club video for the first time. Furtado said of the video, [...] "It's that whole dance that goes on. There's that mystery there, the fun, playful sexiness, the verbal Ping-Pong game". Furtado and Timbaland cannot decide whether they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> dating or instead flirt with others on the dance floor. Their single performances are intercut with several scenes of a dancing crowd, and the lighting changes between blue, green, red, and yellow colors.|$|E
2500|$|Tony's {{relationship}} with Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) was often strained by Jacqui's desire for children. Tony and Jacqui agree to adopt. Pickard commented that adoption is [...] "not something [...] even considered until Jacqui suggested it. Now he’s really into it though. They were both heartbroken when she lost {{the baby and}} found out she can never have children. Adoption could give them the family they desperately want". Pickard explained that the couple love each other and do not [...] "necessarily" [...] need a child to seal their relationship but they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> a family together. Pickard stated that despite Jacqui's past, his character [...] "sees some very good qualities in her". The actor revealed that Tony tries to stay positive that the couple {{will be able to}} adopt despite Jacqui's criminal record. When the couple are told they can not adopt, Pickard said they are [...] "devastated". He went on to add that the couple's desire for children is [...] "very strong" [...] so they may go down other routes such as surrogacy. When questioned if Jacqui is the one for Tony, his portrayer stated: [...] "He's committed to her and wants them to be together. They have a connection even though they’re constantly splitting up and getting back together. Jacqui could well be his Mrs Right at last". Pickard teased that [...] "maybe [...] already has a child – or maybe he’ll get someone pregnant by accident..." [...] He went on to add that [...] "even by soap standards, Tony's had shocking luck".|$|E
