2500|$|The {{charge of}} a uranium nucleus, we found, was indeed large enough to {{overcome}} {{the effect of the}} surface tension almost completely; so the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble a very wobbly unstable drop, ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation, such as the impact of a single neutron. But there was another problem. After separation, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy, about 200MeV in all; <b>where</b> <b>could</b> that energy come from? ...Lise Meitner... worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula E= mc2, and one-fifth of a proton mass was just equivalent to 200MeV. So here was the source for that energy; it all fitted! ...|$|E
