2500|$|Just a {{few weeks}} later, Pollock became deeply {{involved}} in the Hardin County onion pickers strike. [...] On June 19, 1934, onion <b>weeders</b> formed the first union of farm laborers in the United States, {{under the auspices of the}} International Quarrymen's Union. The 30 employers belong to the Onion Growers' Association, refused to recognize or bargain with the union, so the union called a strike. On June 22, a local court judge issued a sweeping labor injunction which restricted picketing in groups of two. Local sheriff's deputies began mass arrests of the picketers for congregating in violation of the injunction. The county sheriff, supplied with funds provided by the employers, hired Ohio National Guard troops who had recently served in Toledo during the Auto-Lite strike, and armed them with riot guns, machine-guns, and tear gas. Protests from Governor George White regarding the use of public equipment for private use were ignored. The troops helped break the strike by forcing workers off the picket lines, and arrests hundreds of workers. [...] When a truck full of replacement workers attempted to run down a group of picketers, the picketers retaliated by throwing stones. [...] Pollock was jailed, and a $1,000 bail set for this incident. Pollock was held incommunicado for several days. [...] When the local sheriff did tell Sarah Pollock where her husband was, he denied her access to him. When Pollock finally met with his defense attorneys, sheriff's deputies crowded close to listen in the conversations, and physically intimidate the lawyers. The strike ended shortly thereafter without agreement, and the union disbanded.|$|E

They went from one deserted house to another, marvelling at their quaint simplicity, and debating which they should choose.

In order to measure the value of <b>WEEDER</b> for identifying unknown grasses in comparison to a com- mon! used methoB, the dichotomous iffentificalion key, 41 volunteers were assigned to one of two groups; (i) those with any previous experience in plant diagnosis or any formal training in plant science; and (ii) those with no experience or training.

Below lay the {{thatched}} roofs of the little village of Bratham, {{and to the right}} the waters of the lake shone like silver in the glancing sunlight, whilst the gables of the old house, peeping out from amongst the budding foliage, looked very picturesque. The spring had cast her green garment over the land; from every copse rang out the melody of birds, and the gentle breeze was heavy with the scent of the unnumbered violets that starred the mossy carpet at their feet.

I hope that the next 29th of June, which is St. John Baptist's day, I shall not see the several pasture fields adjacent to this metropolis, especially that behind Montague House, thronged, as they were the last year, with well dressed young ladies crawling busily up and down upon their knees, as if they were a parcel of <b>weeders,</b> when all the business is to hunt superstitiously after a coal under the root of a plantain, to put under their heads that night, that they may dream who should be their husbands.

Give me leave first to tell you, that though what you aim at may be arrived to by these means, yet these means make that a miserable fortune which would have been a good one; because, in order to know human things beforehand, you use preternatural mediums, which destroy the goodness of the courses, which nature herself was taking for you, and annexes to them diabolical influences, which commonly carry along with them fatalities in this world as well as the next. You will, therefore, give me your pardon likewise, ladies, if I relate some other of these practices, which bare relation of itself, after what I have said before, seems to me sufficient to explode them.|$|E

When he is alone I don't think he says anything, and I dare say he feels very lonely and frightened, just as the lean man does, at the queer noises and the endless lines of the trees. He finds the strangest kinds of seeds, some of them bright coloured like lollipops, or really like precious stones; some of them in odd cases like tobacco-pouches. He finds and collects all kinds of little shells with which the whole ground is scattered, and which, though they are the shells of land animals like our snails, are nearly of as many shapes and colours as the shells on our sea-beaches. In the streams that come running down out of the mountains, and which are all as clear and bright as mirror glass, he sees eels and little bright fish that sometimes jump together out of the surface of the brook in a little knot of silver, and fresh-water prawns which lie close under the stones, and can be seen looking up at him with eyes of the colour of a jewel. He sees all kinds of beautiful birds, some of them blue and white, some of them blue and white and red, and some of them coloured like our pigeons at home, and these last the little girls in the cellar may like to know live almost entirely on nutmegs as they fall ripe off the trees. Another little bird he may sometimes see, as the lean man saw him only this morning, a little fellow not so big as a man's hand, exquisitely neat, of a pretty bronze black like ladies' shoes, and who sticks up behind him (much as a peacock does) his little tail shaped and fluted like a scallop shell.|$|E

Vibrations of the <b>weeder</b> mechanism were first measured without soil contact for different angular velocities of the rotary tine disk.

RMS accelerations and the frequency spectrum were used to evaluate the vibrations levels. Moist loam soil and sand had the highest and lowest increases in accelerations, respectively.

50|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{is a good}} {{illustration}} of unintentional selection by humans. Although the human selective agents might be conscious of {{their impact on the}} local weed gene pool, such effects go against the goals of those growing crops. <b>Weeders</b> do not want to select weeds that are increasingly similar to the cultivated plant, yet the only other option is to let the weeds grow and compete with crops for sunlight and nutrients. Similar situations include antibiotic resistance and, of similar nature to crop mimicry, herbicide resistance. This can be contrasted with other forms of artificial selection that do tend toward a favorable outcome, such as selective breeding. Having acquired many desirable qualities by being subjected to similar selective pressures, Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves. Vavilov called these weeds-become-crops secondary crops.|$|E
50|$|Only a few {{diseases}} and pests {{are known to}} attack proso millet, {{but they are not}} economically important. Weeds are a bigger problem. The critical phase is in juvenile development. The formation of the grains happens in the 3, up to 5, leaf stadium. After that, all nutrients should be available for the millet, so it is necessary to prevent the growth of weeds. In conventional farming, herbicides may be used. In organic farming it is possible to use harrow <b>weeders</b> and interrow cultivators, but special sowing parameters described in the chapter above are needed.For good crop development, fertilization with 50 to 75 kg nitrogen per hectare is recommended. Planting proso millet in a crop rotation after maize should be avoided due to its same weed spectrum. Because proso millet is an undemanding crop, it may be used {{at the end of the}} rotation.|$|E
