5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this time, {{as it had}} just been granted city status and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. The buildings today are {{regarded as one of}} Mountfort's most important works.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept {{it in the same}} class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E
