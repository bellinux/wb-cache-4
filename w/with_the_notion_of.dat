5|$|Groups share a {{fundamental}} kinship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> symmetry. For example, a symmetry group encodes symmetry {{features of a}} geometrical object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Poincaré groups, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity; and point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{the concept}} of {{symmetry}} is studied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a mathematical group. Every polyhedron has an associated symmetry group, which is the set of all transformations (Euclidean isometries) which leave the polyhedron invariant.

One often distinguishes between the full symmetry group, which includes reflections, and the proper symmetry group, which includes only rotations.|$|E

Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty’s ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty’s thought under a common category of “reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism”) seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress he puts on the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} a Noetherian ring is of {{fundamental}} importance in both commutative and noncommutative ring theory, due to the role it plays in simplifying the ideal structure of a ring. For instance, the ring of integers and the polynomial ring over a field are both Noetherian rings, and consequently, such theorems as the Lasker–Noether theorem, the Krull intersection theorem, and the Hilbert's basis theorem hold for them. Furthermore, if a ring is Noetherian, then it satisfies the descending chain condition on prime ideals. This property suggests a deep theory of dimension for Noetherian rings beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> the Krull dimension.|$|E
25|$|Special {{relativity}} {{implies a}} wide range of consequences, which have been experimentally verified, including length contraction, time dilation, relativistic mass, mass–energy equivalence, a universal speed limit and relativity of simultaneity. It has replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position. Rather than an invariant time interval between two events, there is an invariant spacetime interval. Combined with other laws of physics, the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy, as expressed in the mass–energy equivalence formula E=mc2, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{homosexual}} behaviour was decriminalised in Czechoslovakia, {{following a}} scientific research of Kurt Freund that included phallometry of homosexually oriented men {{who appeared to}} have given up sexual relations with other men and established heterosexual marriages.

The claim that phallometry on men was the reason for decriminalization of homosexual behavior in Czechoslovakia is contradicted by the fact that it applied to women as well, as the notion of a male-specific fixity of sexual orientation as an argument for gay rights combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> female sexual plasticity is adverse to lesbian rights.|$|E
25|$|Since the Roman Empire, {{most western}} {{contributions}} to Western legal culture was {{the emergence of}} a class of Roman jurists. During the Middle Ages, St. Thomas Aquinas, the most influential western scholar of the period, integrated the theory of natural law <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> an eternal and biblical law. During the Renaissance, Prof. Alberico Gentili, the founder of the science of international law, authored the first treatise on public international law and separated secular law from canon law and Roman Catholic theology. Enlightenment's greatest legal theorists, Cesare Beccaria, Giambattista Vico and Francesco Mario Pagano, are well remembered for their legal works, particularly on criminal law.|$|E
