5|$|After the World Cup, former <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> cricketer Phil Simmons {{took over}} the role of coach from Birrell. India were {{scheduled}} to play South Africa in a series of One Day Internationals in Ireland in June 2007. Ireland also played one-off matches at Stormont against the two teams. Missing several players from their World Cup squad, Ireland lost both games. Ireland hosted a quadrangular tournament in Dublin and Belfast in July involving the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> the Netherlands, and Scotland. Ireland and the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> both won their games against Scotland and the Netherlands with their direct encounter ending in no result due to rain. The <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> won the tournament because of a bonus point won against the Netherlands. Trent Johnston stepped down as captain and was replaced by William Porterfield in March 2008.|$|E
5|$|BWI. Athletes from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago competed as the British <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> (BWI) at the 1960 Games. The <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> Federation only existed as {{a nation}} from 1958–1962, so the {{constituent}} nations once again competed independently in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{continued}} to play for Trinidad between 1923 and 1926, although, owing to his business commitments, {{he was unable to}} play in every game. In 1926 he played against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was touring the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> for both Trinidad and a <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> team. He passed fifty three times against the touring team, and such was his improvement as a batsman that critics suggested he could hold a place in the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> team for his batting alone. However, Dewhurst did not play another first-class match until 1930.|$|E
5|$|England {{came to the}} <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> {{for their}} first defence of the Wisden Trophy. The {{recently}} appointed captain for England was Michael Vaughan, Hussain having stepped down a few months previously. Lara led the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> challenge.|$|E
5|$|He {{played only}} two Tests in 1972 owing {{to a series}} of injuries, but rejoined the team in the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> under Denness' captaincy. Boycott was {{dismissed}} for 99 in the first innings against the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, followed by a career-best first-class score of 261 not out against a <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> Board President's XI.|$|E

5|$|The 1969 {{tour was}} a three Test series. The captains were Ray Illingworth for England and Sobers for the <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b> The <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> had an ageing team and, with Sobers {{suffering}} {{a loss of}} form, were always the weaker side.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} of the Wisden Trophy series to take place in the <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b> The series showed a more {{sinister}} side of the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> with a riot occurring in the drawn second Test and the English team being attacked at the conclusion of the final Test.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 70s and 80s, {{many of the}} series between the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> and England had been {{dominated}} by the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> who had won fourteen of the fifteen Tests, often by large margins. The next two series in 1989–90 season and 1991 {{would prove to be}} closer contests.|$|E

5|$|A team {{must win}} a series {{to hold the}} Wisden Trophy. A drawn series results in the {{previous}} holders retaining the trophy. To date, a total of 23 Wisden Trophy series have been played, with <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> winning 13 and England 6. The remaining 3 series were drawn, with <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> retaining the Wisden Trophy on each occasion (1973–74, 1991 and 1995). In the series' 44-year history the Wisden Trophy has changed hands on five occasions (1968, 1973, 2000 and twice in 2009) with England regaining the trophy in 1968, 2000 and May 2009, while the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> regained it in 1973 and April 2009.|$|E
5|$|Australian Merv Hughes is {{the only}} bowler to take a hat-trick where the wickets fell over three overs. He took a wicket with the final ball of an over. With the first ball of the next over he took the final wicket of the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> innings. He then removed the opener Gordon Greenidge with the first ball of the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> second innings.|$|E
5|$|Best innings bowling: 4/11, Alex Cusack v <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> 21 February 2014 at Sabina Park, Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, with the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> not the force they had been, and England on the rise. The key players for the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> were Lara, Walsh and Bishop while England {{had a strong}} opening pair of Atherton and Graham Thorpe plus the young Dominic Cork who would be decisive in England's two Test {{victories}} in this series.|$|E
5|$|Davidson was {{selected}} for the 1954–55 tour of the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> where he injured his right ankle in a tour match against Jamaica and missed the First Test against the <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b> Upon his recovery, he could not break into the XI and did not play {{in any of the}} Tests, which Australia won 3–0. He scored 70 runs at 35.00 and took four wickets at 51.75 in three first-class outings.|$|E
5|$|During the 1912–13 season, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) toured <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> {{playing in}} Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana. The MCC played two matches against each island and faced a {{representative}} <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> side in each location. Small played for Trinidad against the tourists; he made scores of 25 and 26, and took seven for 49 in the MCC first innings, adding another wicket {{in the second}} innings. Although that match was lost by Trinidad, the second game was drawn. Small scored 28 runs and took one wicket in the game. He {{was included in the}} <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> team which played at Port of Spain, but had little success.|$|E
5|$|During the war, at {{the request}} of the British government, Constantine made radio {{broadcasts}} to the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> reporting on the involvement of West Indians in the war effort. As a result, he was often asked to speak on BBC radio about his life in England. His radio performances met with critical acclaim, and he became a frequent guest on radio panel shows; he also took part in a film documentary, <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> calling, in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Early the {{following}} year, a weakened English cricket team toured the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> playing four Tests and eight other first-class matches. Fernandes captained British Guiana {{in both of}} their matches against the MCC, each of which was lost by an innings. Generally, the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> named a different captain for each of their home matches, commonly selecting a player from the host colony for the honour due to financial constraints. Fernandes was chosen as captain for the Test played at Bourda, Georgetown, British Guiana. The first two Tests had resulted in a draw and an English victory. Fernandes won the toss and elected to bat first. Clifford Roach and Errol Hunte opened the batting for the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> and scored 144 runs together for the opening partnership before Hunte was out for 53. George Headley then joined Roach at the crease, and the pair took the score onto 336 before Roach was dismissed after reaching his double century. Fernandes and Headley took the score up to 400, of which Fernandes added 22. The remaining batsmen were dismissed for a combined 71; Headley scored a century and the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> were all out for 471. The England team was then bowled out for 145, a first innings deficit of 326. Despite the healthy lead, Fernandes chose not to enforce the follow-on, and the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> batted again to score 290, leaving England requiring 617 runs in the fourth innings to achieve victory. Patsy Hendren scored a century for the visitors, but no other batsman reached 50 runs, and with just four minutes of the match remaining, the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> secured their maiden Test win by 289 runs.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Lloyd St Hill (9 March 1904– 21 May 1957) was a Trinidadian cricketer {{who played}} two Test matches for the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> in 1930. His brothers, Wilton and Cyl, also played for Trinidad; in addition, the former played Test matches for the <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b> St Hill first played local cricket in Trinidad {{with some success}} and {{graduated}} to the Trinidad team. He played regularly {{for the next five}} years but was not selected for any representative West Indian teams. His increased success in 1929 attracted the attention of the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> selectors, and he played two Test matches against England in 1930. Although not particularly successful, he bowled steadily and was chosen to tour Australia with the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> in 1930–31. He was fairly effective in first-class games but the form of the other fast bowlers in the team meant that he was not chosen for any of the Test matches.|$|E
5|$|Eight teams {{participated in}} the first tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> (the six Test nations at the time), {{together}} with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa. One notable omission was South Africa, who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid. The tournament was won by the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|England {{currently}} {{hold the}} trophy. They held the trophy for nine years, after beating the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> 3–1 to regain it in 2000; they successfully defended the trophy three times. <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> regained the trophy in the 2009 {{series in the}} <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> winning 1–0. It was originally planned to consist of four Test matches. However an extra match was arranged when the second Test had to be abandoned {{after only a few}} overs play because the ground was unfit. England regained the trophy in May 2009, winning a two Test series 2–0. The tour, coming uncommonly soon after England toured the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> replaced the previously announced tour by Sri Lanka, which in turn was arranged to replace the originally scheduled tour by Zimbabwe.. Since then England have held onto the trophy up to and including the 2017 series in England, which they won to retain the Trophy.|$|E
5|$|England won the 1957 Test {{series against}} the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> 3–0 and the 1958 series against New Zealand 4–0. But despite having what was {{regarded}} as a strong team, England lost 4–0 in Australia in 1958–59. The team was more successful afterwards, beating India 5–0 in 1959, defeating <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> 1–0 in 1959–60 and South Africa 3–0 in 1960. Allen's final series as chairman was against Australia in 1961; England lost after making tactical mistakes in the fourth Test.|$|E

5|$|Following Australia's {{victory in}} 1994–95, when <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> toured Australia in 1996–97 {{the series was}} heavily publicised as a re-match. However, the visiting team were often ineffective, {{continuing}} a trend of decline, and depended heavily on their senior players, {{one of whom was}} Ambrose. He began the series poorly, continuing a pattern established in several preceding series, and critics suggested that he was no longer effective. After taking only three wickets in the first two Tests, both of which were lost by <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> Ambrose told his team-mates that he would take ten wickets in the third. On a difficult pitch for batting, he managed to take nine in the match, including three in the first hour of the game, despite struggling with a hamstring injury. <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> won, and Ambrose was named man of the match, but he missed the fourth Test with an injury. Writing in Wisden, Greg Baum suggested that Ambrose absence possibly affected the outcome of the series; Australia won easily to ensure they won the series. Ambrose returned for the final match, and on another difficult batting pitch, took five for 43 on the first day. <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> won and Ambrose was again man of the match. He led the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> bowling averages with 19 wickets at 23.36, but had been the driving factor in West Indies' two wins. Ambrose also played in an ODI tournament during the tour of Australia, taking nine wickets at 27.33. Later in the season, between March and May 1997, India toured West Indies; Ambrose took ten wickets at 30.10 in the Test series, including five for 87 in the second Test, but was no longer the home team's most effective bowler. Then in June, Sri Lanka played a two-Test series, won 1–0 by <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b> In the first, Ambrose took five for 37 in the first innings, and eight wickets in the game, to be named man of the match. This included his 300th wicket in Test matches; he was the 12th bowler, and fourth West Indian, to reach this landmark. Ambrose also played five ODIs during the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> home season, taking nine wickets.|$|E
5|$|Garry Sobers was {{the captain}} for the <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> while England had three captains: Mike Smith (first Test), Cowdrey (second-fourth Test) and Brian Close (fifth Test) during the five Test series. The <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> team {{was not as}} strong as in the {{previous}} series, but many of their deficiencies were glossed over by Sobers' exceptional all-round performance. He scored centuries in three Test matches and claimed five wicket innings hauls in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|Graduating {{from playing}} at the Demerara Cricket Club as a teenager, to play for British Guiana in 1922, Fernandes took part in tours of England in 1923 and 1928. He made his debut Test {{appearance}} during the 1928 tour, playing {{in the first of}} the three Tests. His next, and final Test match came during the English tour of the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> in 1930. At the time, the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> had a practice of picking their captain from the colony that the match was being played in, and Fernandes was granted the honour for the match in British Guiana. The <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> won the match, their maiden victory in Test cricket. After the match, Fernandes only played one further first-class match, and retired from first-class cricket in 1932.|$|E

5|$|In April 1992, South Africa toured <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> for {{the first}} time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, {{all of which were}} won by <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b> The Test match was the first time <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> bowled under a new playing {{regulation}} which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began {{the final day of the}} match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.|$|E
5|$|Karthik then {{featured}} in the four-match ODI series against <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> and after not batting in the victory in the first match, he top-scored with 63 as a specialist batsman when India recovered from 35/3 to post 189 on a slow wicket at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack. India {{went on to win}} by 20 runs, giving Karthik his first man of the match award. He was rewarded with continued selection for the subsequent series against Sri Lanka and the 2007 Cricket World Cup. However, Karthik faltered in the series against Sri Lanka, managing only 31, 4 not out and 1, leaving his position in jeopardy. In two warm-up matches in the <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> {{before the start of the}} World Cup, Karthik scored 3 and 38 not out against The Netherlands and the <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b>|$|E
