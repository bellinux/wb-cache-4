500|$|After {{finishing}} the album, Townsend stated {{the project was}} [...] "punishing" [...] and an [...] "absolute nightmare to complete" [...] due to amount of material against tight schedules. He also described the hardship of the project by telling [...] "if he <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to start drinking , the last months would have been it", but now [...] "he's starting to get excited again". Later, [...] "after the chaos of finishing it had subsided", Townsend stated he is really satisfied with the result.|$|E

500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to learn to surf – no way! Because I can imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E
500|$|Crompton and Halbish {{knew that}} if the {{involvement}} of Waugh and Warne with bookmakers was revealed, {{the credibility of the}} two players as witnesses against the Pakistani captain Malik would be severely questioned, as they too were involved in activities associated with unregistered gambling. There would be significant pressure on the ACB to ban the players, so they decided to cover up the matter. Board member Cam Battersby said, [...] "The only way he [...] <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to be convicted was if our evidence was credible... Revealing the information...would provide an excuse for Pakistan to do nothing". The ACB prepared a press release in case the matter was leaked. The ACB's legal adviser Graeme Johnson later said that he had told Crompton that they were not obliged to tell the press about the matter.|$|E
500|$|Steph's {{relationships}} were {{a focal point}} of many reviews. The Daily Mirror Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson found a 2004 love triangle between Steph, her sister Debbie and love interest Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) [...] "surprising compelling". Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando: [...] "With the best will in the world, I don't feel that marriage <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to last". Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes' [...] "About You Now" [...] at Max's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury felt there was [...] "plenty of chemistry" [...] between Steph and Gilly. Their relationship was frequently commented on by the Daily Mail Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column. She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl's rivalry over Gilly, and found it implausible that she and Jem would quarrel over him. When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She highlighted a lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: [...] "Of course, {{you know that the}} moment she says that nothing is going to stop her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the character's small {{appearances}} in Part II, {{most of them}} were well received. The way Orochimaru angers Naruto Uzumaki in their battle as well as how he manages events ever since his reintroduction have been deemed as [...] "near perfectly" [...] by Mania's Chris Beveridge. Orochimaru's fight against Sasuke in later parts from the series was praised by Mangalife's Park Cooper due to how it changes [...] "the nature of things" [...] in a short time. While agreeing with Cooper, Beveridge found that the fight did not bring a certain end to Orochimaru which he thought it would have made it more entertaining. On the other hand, Beveridge liked how during the fight between the two a flashback showed Orochimaru's backstory in Konoha, which helped in expanding his character. His apparent redemption to follow Sasuke in later parts of the story was criticized by writer Jason Thompson during a review of the manga. On the other hand, Bryce Coulter from the Fandom Post found Orochimaru's change based on Sasuke's new interest intriguing due to the future possibilities of becoming Konohagakure's ally. Ramsey Isler from IGN still praised the relationship between Orochimaru and his ally Kabuto Yakushi as the former often wondered if Kabuto <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to betray him. In the final episodes of the anime Naruto Shippuden Orochimaru made small cameos during the preparations for Naruto and Hinata's wedding which were found hilarious by Amy Mcnulty from Anime News Network.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{appearing}} on America's Got Talent, Fator had almost {{given up on}} achieving success in show business as a ventriloquist. [...] "It wasn't easy trying to keep going all these years, {{and by the time}} I was in my late 30s, I wasn't sure it <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to happen," [...] says Fator.|$|E

2500|$|In 1165, {{hopes of}} Henry II's son's future {{accession}} to the French throne were dashed when Adèle {{gave birth to}} a son, Philip. Following this, the fragile Anglo-French peace ended. In 1167, Henry II marched into Auvergne, and in 1170 he also attacked Bourges. Louis VII answered by raiding the Norman Vexin, forcing Henry II to move his troops north, giving Louis the opportunity to free Bourges. At this point, John Gillingham mentions in The Angevin Empire that he believes Louis [...] "must have wondered whether there <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to be an end to Henry's aggressively expansionist policies".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that Parker would succeed Royal Marine Lieutenant General Sir Jim Dutton as deputy commander of ISAF in Afghanistan. During his tenure as deputy commander, Parker denied claims that British personnel in Afghanistan were suffering from a lack of equipment and helicopters, saying in an interview [...] "rather than asking for more helicopters– which may be a requirement– we've got to develop tactics that get you out and amongst the people and re-establish ourselves as a force for good in the community" [...] and that he was [...] "absolutely convinced that what Harry [...] was given was right for what he was doing. However, nothing <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to stop his leg getting blown off". Parker was serving in Afghanistan on Christmas Day 2009 and undertook a tour of British bases in the area to visit troops.|$|E
2500|$|The early Game Theory was {{described}} as a [...] "pseudo-psychedelic pop quartet" [...] for which Miller sang and wrote [...] "almost all of the material." [...] On the first three releases, Miller shared co-writing credits on [...] "The Young Drug" [...] with Alternate Learning's Carolyn O'Rourke, and on [...] "Life in July" [...] with Nancy Becker. Miller also included three songs that were written by Fred Juhos, and later defended the decision to record Juhos's songs as a Beatles-like [...] "relief from seriousness," [...] though only one was included in the Distortion of Glory compilation. Juhos's contributions were criticized as failing to mesh with Miller's, and Miller later mused, [...] "It's funny that his stuff wasn't popular. We all had the impression that no one <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to get into my stuff and that his one or two would be the ones to catapult us to fame." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 26 July, Major Mannock {{offered to}} help a new arrival, Lt. Donald C. Inglis from New Zealand, obtain his first victory. After {{shooting}} down an enemy LVG two-seater behind the German front-line, Mannock {{is believed to have}} dived to the crash site to view the wreckage, seemingly breaking one of the unwritten rules of fellow pilots. In consequence, while crossing the trenches the fighters were met with a massive volley of ground-fire. The engine of Mannock's aircraft was hit and immediately caught fire, and shortly after the plane crashed behind German lines. Mannock's body {{is believed to have been}} found, though this is unproven, about 250 yards from the wreck of his machine, perhaps thrown, perhaps jumped. The body showed no gunshot wounds; Mannock always promised to shoot himself if he <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> down in flames. The BBC Timewatch programme [...] "WW1 Aces Falling" [...] details the search to prove whether or not that this body was that of Mannock. Inglis described what happened: ...|$|E
2500|$|Film critic Scott Mendelson, {{writing in}} The Huffington Post, cited Scully {{as an example}} of strong female {{characters}} on television, calling her [...] "one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre". Radio Times Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1. Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, [...] "The very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's not as though he <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change". She praised her for being more [...] "rational, resilient, [...] mature" [...] than her partner and for their mature relationship. In a review of [...] "Irresistible", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that it was a cliché to put Scully in danger, as [...] "Scully is [...] heart, and any time she's in danger, it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart".|$|E
