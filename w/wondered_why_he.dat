25|$|Rob Donovan reads {{an article}} in the {{newspaper}} about Johnny at the factory. He then requests a visit from Tracy and tells his prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. Tracy turned up to visit Rob and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had chosen to contact her after such time, however Rob confessed to being angry at first but could never stop loving her and he did not blame her for him being arrested. After Tracy's visit, Rob requested a visit from Johnny, and reveals that he is the father of Carla. He demands £10,000 from Johnny to keep it secret. Johnny told him that Tracy was with Robert Preston. Johnny does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. Rob then sent a visiting order to Robert. He told him about Tracy wanting to start a new relationship with him. Robert was disgusted and stormed out. He then split up with Tracy. Rob reveals to Tracy that everything was a lie and that he still hated her. Johnny reveals all to a disgusted Carla. Carla is furious, however Johnny continues to plead with Carla not to tell Aidan and Kate. Carla Sleeps with Robert. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who attempts to persuade Carla not to tell Nick. Carla continues to threaten to tell Johnny's children the truth unless he moves away, which he does not. Carla reveals that she is their half-sister to Kate and Aidan, who are distraught. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their affair to Nick if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit under wraps. She also begins bonding with Kate. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, but changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the bistro to confront him. Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows. However, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), and his friend, Lee, burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase. She jumps into the car, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the car drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious. She survived and Tracy pressures her to persuade Nick to sell the Bistro. He eventually sells to Robert, and Carla and Nick make plans to move to Devon.|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} these was Daredevil (2003), in which Affleck starred as the blind superhero. Affleck was a {{longtime}} comic book fan, and had written a foreword for Kevin Smith's Guardian Devil (1999) about his love for the character of Daredevil. The film was a commercial success, but received a mixed response from critics. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said Affleck was [...] "lost" [...] in the role: [...] "A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor." [...] In 2014, Affleck described Daredevil as the only film he regretted making. He next appeared as a low-ranking mobster in the romantic comedy Gigli (2003), co-starring Lopez. The film was almost uniformly panned, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times remarking that [...] "Affleck doesn't have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material." [...] Yet Affleck has repeatedly defended director Marty Brest since the film's release, describing him as [...] "one of the really great directors". In his last film role of 2003, Affleck starred as a reverse engineer in the sci-fi thriller Paycheck (2003). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked on Affleck's [...] "self-deprecating charm" [...] and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> could not find better scripts. Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found it [...] "almost unfair" [...] to critique Affleck, given that he [...] "had such a rough year".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{seemingly}} concluded, Pryce's {{evidence was}} not used in court; this was because the authorities <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had failed {{to make contact with}} them in February when this happened. While the trial (and thus information about the plot) was mostly focused on the attempted assassination of the King, Despard and his co-conspirators also contemplated the seizure of the Bank of England and a military rising of the Third Grenadiers stationed at the Tower of London. [...] They hoped that these attacks would set off uprisings all over the country.|$|E
2500|$|Ownership {{changed hands}} {{several times during}} the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor {{decision-making}} and planning. Owner Pete Queseda once <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> needed to pay players who didn't belong in the majors and later agreed to a 10-year lease at D.C. Stadium—a move that would come back to haunt the Senators. In , Quesada sold his stake in the club and resigned. Washington stockbrokers James Johnson and James Lemon owned the team briefly, suffering massive financial losses. Johnson died in [...] and Lemon sold the team a year later to hotel and trucking executive Bob Short, who outbid a group headed by Bob Hope. Short named himself general manager and hired Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager. Although Williams had never coached or managed at any level of baseball, he seemed to light a spark under the once-moribund Senators. Williams kept them in contention for most of the 1969 season; their 86–76 record would be its only winning season in Washington.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{hijacking}} progressed, {{the passengers}} recognised the personalities of the hijackers. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled {{that the crew}} and passengers gave nicknames to the hijackers [...] "to make things simpler." [...] Yahia, the leader, had given his name, so the passengers called him by that name. According to Burgniard, Lotfi had a [...] "peculiar" [...] character, [...] "was always on a knife edge," [...] and [...] "the most fanatic" [...] and [...] "the most fundamentalist" [...] of the hijackers. Therefore, he received the nickname [...] "Madman" [...] from the passengers. According to Burgniard, Lotfi was the hijacker who insisted that the passengers follow Islamic law. Lotfi found women having their heads uncovered [...] "intolerable," [...] making him very angry. One hijacker did not give his name to the passengers, so they called him [...] "Bill." [...] Burgniard stated that Bill was [...] "a little bit simple" [...] and [...] "more of a goatherd than a terrorist." [...] She said {{his role as a}} hijacker was [...] "an error in casting." [...] Burgniard remembered that the occupants wondered why Bill was there and that they saw Bill appearing as if he <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was there, as well. The hijacker nicknamed [...] "The Killer" [...] shot the hostages whom the hijackers had targeted.|$|E
