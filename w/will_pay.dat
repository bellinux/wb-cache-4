40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} pay for an improved water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> for improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as they are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> for its provision. Those with a higher income were <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> for an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> for improved water quality and reliability. Larger families are not <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> for an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people are lesser <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> for improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E

The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E

Quantitative analysis was used based on 1, 067 face-to-face interviews collected in 3 Italian regions in the north bordering the Adriatic Sea (Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna) carried out during 2008. The consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) is measured using a contingent valuation method. In order to estimate separately the determinants of the probability that respondents are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> and the maximum that they are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay,</b> a generalization of Tobit model was adopted. The results indicate that consumers are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> a premium price mainly to purchase better quality products.
