5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.|$|E

5|$|Aalborghus Castle (Aalborghus Slot) is a half-timbered {{building}} with red-painted woodwork and whitewashed wall panels. It {{was built in}} the mid-16th century by King Christian III for his vassals <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> taxes and is the only remaining example {{of its kind in the}} country. The park, dungeon and casemates, but not the castle itself, are open to the public in the summer months. In the 1950s, the castle was converted into administrative offices.|$|E
5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, {{and the right to}} tax local areas.|$|E
5|$|Arghezi's texts for Seara {{were largely}} unknown to later generations. They again saw print in 2003, in a {{critical}} edition co-edited by daughter Mitzura Arghezi (Domnica Theodorescu) and Traian Radu. According to philogist Gheorghe Pienescu, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s, the copies were taken from him under false pretense by Mitzura Arghezi, and never returned. As an additional contribution to Romanian literature, Searas popularization of the expression craii de Curtea-Veche may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in writing his celebrated 1929 novel.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of its}} 1996 Pepsi Stuff {{marketing}} campaign, Pepsi ran {{an advertisement}} promising a Harrier jet to anyone <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted {{to take advantage of}} the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim a jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a lawsuit ensued, in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{have been}} useful for retrospective studies. Bird collections offer {{the potential for}} current and future researchers to make in-depth morphological and molecular study of past avian diversity. One of the earliest and most famous examples of this {{was the use of}} egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> the eggs could never have known that their work would one day help establish causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli) is {{a species}} of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It was given its common name by Oldfield Thomas in honour of C. W. Campbell (Charles William Campbell), <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> the first {{specimen}} in Mongolia on July 1, 1902. It is distinguished from the closely related Djungarian hamster as it has smaller ears and no dark fur on its crown. Campbell's dwarf hamster typically has a narrow dorsal stripe compared to the Djungarian hamster and grey fur on the stomach.|$|E

5|$|From 1851 to 1854 Henry Denham {{captain of}} HMS Herald, {{which was on}} a {{scientific}} expedition to the southwest Pacific (1852–1856), completed the island's first hydrographic survey. On board were three Scottish biologists, William Milne (a gardener-botanist from the Edinburgh Botanic Garden), John Macgillivray (naturalist) <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> fish and plant specimens, and Assistant Surgeon and zoologist Denis Macdonald. Together these men established much basic information on the geology, flora and fauna of the island.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, David Harrison {{described}} a small Miniopterus {{from the island}} of Grande Comore as a subspecies, Miniopterus minor griveaudi, of the mainland African species M.minor. The name griveaudi honors Paul Griveaud, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> the specimens on which Harrison based his description. This classification remained {{for the next few}} decades; in 1992, for example, Javier Juste and Carlos Ibáñez recognized five subspecies, including griveaudi, within M.minor, ranging from São Tomé to Madagascar. In their 1995 review of Madagascar bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues recognized the small Malagasy Miniopterus as a separate species, Miniopterus manavi, with griveaudi as a subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The British mustered an {{overwhelming}} force under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and Lieutenant-General George Beckwith, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> 29 ships and 10,000 men – almost {{four times the}} number of French regular forces garrisoning Martinique. Landing in force on both the southern and northern coasts of the island, British troops pushed inland, defeating French regulars in the central highlands and routing local militia units in the south of the island. By 9 February, the entire island was in British hands except Fort Desaix, a powerful position intended to protect the capital Fort-de-France, which had been bypassed during the British advance. In a siege lasting 15 days the Fort was constantly bombarded, the French suffering 200 casualties before finally surrendering.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper Mexican {{cochineal}} {{led to an}} abrupt slump in the Polish cochineal trade, and the 1540s saw a steep decline in quantities of the red dye exported from Poland. In 1547, Polish cochineal disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish cochineal, which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric {{but also as a}} vodka colorant, an ingredient in folk medicine, or even for decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E
5|$|The hardnose shark was {{described}} by German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They named it Carcharias (Hypoprion) macloti in honour of Heinrich Christian Macklot, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> the type specimen from New Guinea. In 1862, American ichthyologist Theodore Gill elevated Hypoprion {{to the rank of}} full genus, with C. macloti as the type species. In 1985, Jack Garrick synonymised Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. This species may also be called Maclot's shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by American botanist William Chambers Coker in 1917, in his monograph of Amanitas {{of the eastern}} United States. Coker's description was based on several specimens he had collected from various locations in North Carolina in September and October 1914. The specific name honors George Atkinson, a Cornell University mycologist <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> and described mushrooms in the southern and eastern United States in the late 19th century. In 1952, Marcel Locquin chose to place it in the genus Armillaria as Armillaria atkinsoniana, but this change was not adopted by later authors.|$|E

5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1880, by Gustav Hartlaub in the Journal für Ornithologie, as Sorella Emini Bey. Hartlaub {{gave it the}} specific name Emini Bey in honour of the explorer Emin Pasha, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> the type specimen in modern South Sudan or Uganda near Lado, and it is occasionally given the eponymous common name Emin Bey's sparrow. Hartlaub's unusual spelling of its specific epithet as two words led some to spell the name emini or emini-bey. No subspecies are recognised, but one was described by British ornithologist George L. G. Van Someren in 1922 from Archers Post in central Kenya, as Sorella eminibey guasso.|$|E
5|$|Today, 19 skins of the Cuban macaw {{exist in}} 15 {{collections}} worldwide (two each in Natural History Museum at Tring, Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and the Smithsonian Museum), {{but many are}} of unclear provenance. Several were provided by the Cuban naturalist Juan Gundlach, <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> some of the last individuals that regularly fed near the Zapata Swamp in 1849–50. Some of the preserved specimens {{are known to have}} lived in captivity in zoos (such as Jardin des Plantes de Paris, Berlin Zoo, and Amsterdam Zoo) or as cagebirds. Several more skins are known to have existed, but have been lost. There are no records of its eggs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these laws}} were relaxed over time, Emperor Wu renewed the state's {{persecution}} of merchants when in 119 BCE {{he made it}} illegal for registered merchants to purchase land. If they violated this law, their land and slaves would be confiscated by the state. The effectiveness of this law is questionable, since contemporary Han writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land. A merchant who owned property worth a thousand catties of gold—equivalent to ten million cash coins—was considered a great merchant. Such a fortune was one hundred {{times larger than the}} average income of a middle class landowner-cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash-coin income of a marquess <b>who</b> <b>collected</b> taxes from a thousand households. Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a hundred million cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government.|$|E
