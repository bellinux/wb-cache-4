5|$|Vesuvius {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the <b>water-saturated</b> sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{liquefaction}} occurs when, {{because of}} the shaking, <b>water-saturated</b> granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{detachment}} {{along the}} weak layers was likely {{aided by the}} presence of high-pressure water in the sediment pore spaces. This possibility has interesting astrobiological implications. If <b>water-saturated</b> zones still exist in sediments under the volcano, they would likely have been kept warm by a high geothermal gradient and residual heat from the volcano's magma chamber. Potential springs or seeps around the volcano would offer exciting possibilities for detecting microbial life.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{problematic}} side-effects of the fires that periodically rage through Malibu is the destruction of vegetation, which normally provides some degree of topographical stability to the loosely packed shale and sandstone hills during periods of heavy precipitation. Rainstorms following large wildfires can thus cause a phenomenon known as mudslides, in which <b>water-saturated</b> earth and rock moves quickly down mountainsides, or entire slices of mountainside abruptly detach and fall downward.|$|E
25|$|According to Mulcahy, “ {{scientists}} and underwater archaeologists {{now believe that}} the earthquake was a powerful one and {{that much of the}} damage at Port Royal resulted from a process known as liquefaction.” Liquefaction occurs when earthquakes strike ground that is loose, sandy, and <b>water-saturated,</b> increasing the water pressure and causing the particles to separate from one another and form a sludge resembling quicksand. Eyewitness accounts attested to buildings sliding into the water, but it is likely some simply sank straight down into the now unstable layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{caused the}} sand under Port Royal to liquefy and flow out into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two feet down before the impact, {{and the town}} was built on a layer of some 65 feet of <b>water-saturated</b> sand. This type of area did not provide a solid foundation {{on which to build}} an entire town. Unlike the Spanish before them, the English had decided to settle and develop the small area of land, even while acknowledging that the area was nothing but “hot loose sand”.|$|E
25|$|Lightning {{protection}} systems {{are used to}} prevent or lessen lightning strike damage to structures. Lightning {{protection systems}} mitigate the fire hazard which lightning strikes pose to structures. A lightning protection system provides a low-impedance path for the lightning current to lessen the heating effect of current flowing through flammable structural materials. If lightning travels through porous and <b>water-saturated</b> materials, these materials may literally explode if their water content is flashed to steam by heat produced from the high current. This is why trees are often shattered by lightning strikes.|$|E
25|$|Also called caissons, drilled shafts, drilled piers, Cast-in-drilled-hole piles (CIDH piles) or Cast-in-Situ piles, a {{borehole}} is drilled {{into the}} ground, then concrete (and often {{some sort of}} reinforcing) is placed into the borehole to form the pile. Rotary boring techniques allow larger diameter piles than any other piling method and permit pile construction through particularly dense or hard strata. Construction methods depend on the geology of the site; in particular, whether boring is to be undertaken in 'dry' ground conditions or through <b>water-saturated</b> strata. Casing is often used when {{the sides of the}} borehole are likely to slough off before concrete is poured.|$|E
25|$|The Marina {{district}} {{was built on}} a landfill made of a mixture of sand, dirt, rubble, waste and other materials containing {{a high percentage of}} groundwater. Some of the fill was rubble dumped into San Francisco Bay after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but most was sand and debris laid down in preparation for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a celebration of San Francisco's ability to rebound after its catastrophe in 1906. After the Exposition, apartment buildings were erected on the landfill. In the 1989 earthquake, the <b>water-saturated</b> unconsolidated mud, sand and rubble suffered liquefaction, and the earthquake's vertical shock waves rippled the ground more severely.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} molten rock intruded into depositional sand but {{it failed to}} erupt through the surface, so erosion took place to expose the igneous formations. In other places molten rock erupted explosively, {{producing}} clouds of solidified lava that later fell back to earth as ash, forming a cone around the vent. In some cases, it erupted several times as a succession of lava flows from a single vent forming widespread basalt layers taking on {{the form of a}} shield. At times, molten rock came into contact with <b>water-saturated</b> sand and it produced superheated and highly pressurized water vapor that exploded though the earth’s surface with a devastating force creating large craters known as maars or lakes.|$|E
25|$|Mass wasting {{events such}} as the 1925 Gros Ventre {{landslide}} continue to change the area. On June 22, 1925 an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 4 weakened {{the side of a mountain}} located three miles (4.8km) outside of the current park's southeastern border. The next day, 50 million cubic yards (38 million cubic meters) of <b>water-saturated</b> Pennsylvanian-aged Tensleep Sandstone slid 1.5 miles (2.4km) from its source on Sheep Mountain and into the Gros Ventre River valley 2,100 feet (640 m) below, damming the river. Stressed by snow melt, the resulting 5 mile (8km) long and 200 feet (60 m) deep lake breached the debris dam on May 18, 1927 and flooded the town of Kelly, Wyoming, killing six.|$|E
25|$|The {{single most}} {{revealing}} property of wood {{as an indicator}} of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986), as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm3 or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (<b>water-saturated)</b> wood and are referred to as basic specific gravity (Timell 1986).|$|E
25|$|Large shield volcanoes grow {{not only}} by adding {{material}} to their flanks as erupted lava, but also by spreading laterally at their bases. As a volcano grows in size, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional. A subterranean rift may develop {{at the base of}} the volcano, causing the underlying crust to spread apart. If the volcano rests on sediments containing mechanically weak layers (e.g., beds of <b>water-saturated</b> clay), detachment zones (decollements) may develop in the weak layers. The extensional stresses in the detachment zones can produce giant landslides and normal faults on the volcano's flanks, leading to the formation of a basal escarpment. Further from the volcano, these detachment zones can express themselves as a succession of overlapping, gravity driven thrust faults. This mechanism has long been cited as an explanation of the Olympus Mons aureole deposits (discussed below).|$|E
25|$|Other surface {{features}} {{may include}} disturbed ground, pressure ridges, faults, water movement (including {{changes to the}} water table level), rockfalls, and ground slump. Most of the gas in the cavity is composed of steam; its volume decreases dramatically as the temperature falls and the steam condenses. There are however other gases, mostly carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which do not condense and remain gaseous. The carbon dioxide is produced by thermal decomposition of carbonates, hydrogen is created by reaction of iron and other metals from the nuclear device and surrounding equipment. The amount of carbonates and water in the soil and the available iron {{have to be considered}} in evaluating the test site containment; <b>water-saturated</b> clay soils may cause structural collapse and venting. Hard basement rock may reflect shock waves of the explosion, also possibly causing structural weakening and venting. The noncondensible gases may stay absorbed in the pores in the soil. Large amount of such gases can however maintain enough pressure to drive the fission products to the ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{installation}} {{began in}} November 1987 and {{was completed by}} 1988, lowered at a pace of half a meter a day. Since the construction took place in <b>water-saturated</b> soils, over 200 frozen wells had to be formed {{so it could be}} lowered to its proper location. In addition, over [...] of rock had to be removed {{to make way for the}} vestibule. After it was finally installed, construction work began on the lower escalator tunnel. Due to a difficult hydrogeology, the tunnel was not completed by the station's grand opening and until 1 May 1990, it could only be reached with a transfer from the Teatralna station.|$|E
500|$|Uturunku's lavas contain biotite, hypersthene, ilmenite, magnetite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. They {{also contain}} inclusions, a few percent andesite, norite and xenoliths {{derived from the}} crust {{containing}} sillimanite gneiss and igneous rocks. Morphological and chemical analysis of the eruption products indicate that the dacites formed by fractional crystallization of andesite magma. Some of the dacite magma was modified by mixing of dacite and andesite magmas. The magma also underwent oxidation and degassing during ascent. Analysis of the erupted dacites indicate that the magma was nearly <b>water-saturated</b> and stored at depths given differently as [...] or [...] by studies, and temperatures of [...] The chemistry and microstructure suggest that Uturunku magmas formed in magma chambers subject to episodic replenishment with hotter magmas. Major and trace element analysis indicates a substantial similarity of Uturunku lavas to local ignimbrites.|$|E
2500|$|According to the AECOM report {{commissioned}} by TVA and released June 25, 2009, failure occurred due {{to a variety of}} causes, primarily due to liquefaction of layers of [...] "slimes" [...] and other <b>water-saturated</b> materials deep within the growing ash pile. Collapse occurred over the course of approximately one hour in consecutive waves of breaking away and sliding.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>water-saturated</b> {{thickness}} of the Ogallala Formation ranges from a few feet to more than 1,000feet (300m) and is generally greater in the Northern Plains. The depth of the water {{below the surface of}} the land ranges from almost [...] in parts of the north to between [...] throughout much of the south. Present-day recharge of the aquifer with fresh water occurs at an exceedingly slow rate, suggesting that much of the water in its pore spaces is paleowater, dating back to the most recent ice age and probably earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Damming of the Lillooet River {{from the}} second block-and-ash flow {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} a lake just upstream. This lake continued to fill when the third block-and-ash flow was erupted, eventually reaching a maximum elevation of [...] and a depth of at least [...] As the lake continued to rise from inflow of the Lillooet River, the variably welded, poorly indurated pyroclastic dam failed catastrophically, releasing lake water down the Pemberton Valley to produce an outburst flood. Large volcanic blocks derived from the pyroclastic dam were carried downstream for [...] where they were deposited in the <b>water-saturated</b> debris.|$|E
2500|$|Quick clay, {{also known}} as Leda Clay in Canada, is a <b>water-saturated</b> gel, which in its solid form {{resemble}} a unique form of highly sensitive clay. This clay {{has a tendency to}} change from a relatively stiff condition to a liquid mass when it is disturbed. This gradual change in appearance from solid to liquid is a process known as spontaneous liquefaction. The clay retains a solid structure despite the high water content (up to 80% by volume), because surface tension holds water-coated flakes of clay together in a delicate structure. [...] When the structure is broken by a shock or sufficient shear, it turns to a fluid state.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} the Ekofisk field {{as a whole}} and the {{platforms}} in particular were found to be suffering from an unexpected degree of subsidence. Detailed geological investigation showed that it was the result of delayed compactional diagenesis of the Chalk Formation reservoir rocks. As hydrocarbons were produced the pore pressure declined and the effective stresses increased leading to subsidence. Water injection was initiated to repressurize the reservoir, but due to the lower compaction strength of <b>water-saturated</b> chalk compared with oil-saturated chalk the seafloor continued subsiding and displacements of several metres were recorded. It was calculated that the total subsidence would almost be [...] {{at the end of the}} concession of Phillips Petroleum, too much to keep the platforms secure.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, {{the best}} {{that can be done}} is to reduce the {{entrance}} of water runoff from higher, stable elevations by capturing and bypassing through channels or pipes, and to drain water infiltrated directly and from subsurface springs by inserting horizontal perforated tubes. There are numerous locations in California where extensive developments have been built atop archaic landslides, which have not moved in historic times but which (if both <b>water-saturated</b> and shaken by an earthquake) have a high probability of moving en masse, carrying entire sections of suburban development to new locations. While the most modern of house structures (well tied to [...] monolithic concrete foundation slabs reinforced with post tensioning cables) may survive such movement largely intact, the building will no longer be in its proper location.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} retrofits is that required to prevent damage due to soil failure. Soil failure can occur on a slope, a slope failure or landslide, or in a flat area due to liquefaction of <b>water-saturated</b> sand and/or mud. Generally, deep pilings must be driven into stable soil (typically hard mud or sand) or to underlying bedrock or the slope must be stabilized. For buildings built atop previous landslides the practicality of retrofit may be limited by economic factors, as it is not practical to stabilize a large, deep landslide. The likelihood of landslide or soil failure may also depend upon seasonal factors, as the soil may be more stable {{at the beginning of a}} wet season than at the beginning of the dry season. Such a [...] "two season" [...] Mediterranean climate is seen throughout California.|$|E
2500|$|All Utricularia are {{carnivorous}} {{and capture}} small organisms {{by means of}} bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in <b>water-saturated</b> soil. The traps can {{range in size from}} 0.2mm to 1.2cm. Aquatic species, such as U.vulgaris (common bladderwort), possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (Daphnia), nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when [...] "set", is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second.|$|E
2500|$|... and {{is covered}} with {{fractured}} plates and sinuous ridges that look like pack-ice on the Earth. Sorted patterned ground and erosion patterns in polygonal terrain in the region support ice-rich material; hence a lake. Also, the presence of streamlined islands, cataracts, and dendritic channel systems suggest formation by water from a lake. [...] Some surfaces here show [...] "Rootless cones" [...] which are mounds with pits. They {{can be caused by}} explosions of lava with ground ice when lava flows on top of ice-rich ground. The ice melts and turns into a vapor that expands in an explosion that produces a cone or ring. Features like these are found in Iceland, when lavas cover <b>water-saturated</b> substrates. The western Elysium Planitia basin can be described as almost a perfect equipotential surface because it slopes only about 10m over a 500km distance—that’s about as level as the Earth’s ocean. [...] This very gentle slope argues against a lava flow. [...] In places, it has been found that the flow surface has been lowered by 50% which is expected if the flow was of water, but not if it were lava. The maximum depth of the lake was estimated to be between 31 and 53m.|$|E

50|$|The {{movement}} {{that happens to}} these glaciers as they slide {{is that of a}} jerky motion where any seismic events, especially at the base of glacier, can cause movement. Most movement is found to be caused by pressured meltwater or very small <b>water-saturated</b> sediments underneath the glacier. This gives the glacier a much smoother surface on which to move as opposed to a harsh surface that tends to slow the speed of the sliding. Although meltwater is the most common source of basal sliding, {{it has been shown that}} <b>water-saturated</b> sediment can also play up to 90% of the basal movement these glaciers make.|$|E
50|$|Both palsas and pingos {{result from}} {{freezing}} {{of water to}} an ice core. Palsas, however, do not necessarily require positive hydrostatic pressure (to inject water), since the boggy soil is <b>water-saturated</b> and therefore has sufficient supply for the growing ice core.|$|E
5000|$|In geology, soil {{liquefaction}} {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} <b>water-saturated,</b> unconsolidated sediments are transformed into a substance that acts like a liquid, often in an earthquake.
