500|$|Producer Norman Dayron {{recalled}} the young Butterfield as [...] "very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, {{kind of a}} hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets... Paul was hard to be friends with." [...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was a bad guy. [...] He carried pistols.

He remembered Butterfield as [...] "not much interested in other people".|$|E

[...] We remixed it at Olympic and added it to the album". [...] Track Records issued the monaural mix on Are You Experienced, which was released on May 12, 1967, in the UK.

[...] So when the album was released in the US, [...] "Purple Haze", [...] "Hey Joe" [...] and [...] "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] were included at the expense of [...] "Red House" [...] and two other songs.

Douglas' version peaked at number 94 on the UK Singles Chart. Talking to Digital Spy, Douglas said: [...] "It's very hard to sing. I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> do it because it's a big chart song and I'm quite old school. For me, the song is about strength and the music video is based around domestic violence and how a woman gets out of it. The lyrics are so powerful for that interpretation. Hopefully if someone is in that situation and watches it, they'll think, I can get out." [...] A music video to accompany the release of [...] "Titanium" [...] was first released onto YouTube on June 12, 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds.

500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> death on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing {{off the ground and}} landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E

The way our left-handers, especially Justin Langer and Matty Hayden, play spin is to be fairly aggressive." [...] However, he was also praised by Ponting. Ponting told the Sunday Age, [...] "He (Panesar) didn't look like he <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> throw the ball up a little bit and actually try to get you out.

Although {{she is more}} deferential to her boss than Sharona, {{referring}} to him as [...] "Mr. Monk", she is not hesitant about telling him when his eccentricities are going too far. A young widow who lives with her daughter Julie, Natalie lost her husband Mitch {{when he was shot}} down over Kosovo in 1998. She first appears in [...] "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring" [...] (3.10).

2500|$|... "All I Have", a {{duet with}} LL Cool J which samples Debra Law's [...] "Very Special", is a breakup song, and has been noted to conjure up her publicized split with Combs. [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] {{features}} lyrics about Lopez remaining humble despite fame and fortune. It samples several songs: [...] "Watch Out Now" [...] by Beatnuts, [...] "Hijack" [...] by Herbie Mann and KRS-One's [...] "South Bronx". The Age wrote that the song intones Lopez's [...] "modest childhood roots, vowing she wishes to remain simple despite her diamonds", while MTV said that she finds [...] "the middle ground between Hollywood A-Lister and Big Apple B-Girl" [...] on the [...] "club-banging" [...] song. In the ballad [...] "Again", Lopez considers finding love again; [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> let go and trust your love," [...] she sings in the second verse.

[...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single.

[...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better.

[...] The Wolf says: [...] "But you're not a camel!" [...] / [...] "Hey, after you are caught and shod, just {{you try to}} prove to them {{that you are not}} a camel!"

The Hare and the joke itself were used to illustrate the hassles of a Soviet lishenets in a 1929 issue of a satirical magazine Chudak. Mikhail Melnichenko, in an article about Soviet political jokes cites a 1926 private collection, which renders the joke in a more gruesome form, where [...] the Hare is scared of the rumor that all camels are taken hostages by Cheka and shot (a reference to the Red Terror).
