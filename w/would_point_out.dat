5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean {{literature}} was to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the direction that North Korean literature was about to take. These works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E

25|$|As Cavendish {{performed}} {{his famous}} {{density of the}} Earth experiment in an outbuilding {{in the garden of}} his Clapham Common estate, his neighbours <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the building and tell their children that it was where the world was weighed. In honor of Henry Cavendish's achievements and due to an endowment granted by Henry's relative William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, the University of Cambridge’s physics laboratory was named the Cavendish Laboratory by James Clerk Maxwell, the first Cavendish Professor of Physics and an admirer of Cavendish's work.|$|E
25|$|The UFW {{considered}} more mass picketing, more rallies, and more boycotts, but the union {{was worried that}} it had lost the support of farm workers and the public and that such events <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{the weakness of the}} union rather than its strength. Instead, the UFW settled on a 110-mile (180km) march by a small group of UFW leaders from San Francisco to the E & J Gallo Winery in Modesto. The organizers envisioned a small but dramatic march that would not require large numbers of participants. Just a few hundred marchers left San Francisco on February 22, 1975. But more than 15,000 people joined them en route {{by the time they reached}} Modesto on March 1.|$|E
500|$|... (b) To advance further towards Aleppo {{would mean}} to move against Damascus and Beirut. On that front enemy is served by broad–gauge railway with good lateral {{communications}} and apparently ideal ground for defence. Broad–gauge railway would put him on level with me as regards numbers that could be maintained. I should require 16 or 18 divisions besides my mounted corps to ensure success against Damascus–Beirut line if strongly held, but this is probably more than my railway could support. My estimate is made on the supposition enemy will make use of his broad-gauge railway to its full capacity. I <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Aleppo is 350miles distant and my single line of railway advances {{about half a mile}} a day. Railhead of my double line is at Bir el Mazar, but the doubling of railway has had to be stopped during my present advance. For my immediate plans see my telegram No. E.A. 598 14 December, and I think it advisable before advancing much further north to clear Turkish forces on Medina railway."

500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E

While the ISKCON theology of personal god is close to Christian theology, both personal and monotheistic, being a preacher of bhakti and a missionary he sometimes would add, that [...] "already many Christians have tasted the nectar of divine love of the holy name and are dancing with karatalas (hand-cymbals) and mridangas (drums)." ...|$|E

[...] The Ōta Faction regularly challenged Iron Chef Morimoto and his neo-Japanese style, winning one out of five battles. Ōta Faction was the name used in the translated version shown on Food Network. In the original Japanese version (shown in the U.S. and transcribed by the Iron Chef Reporter in southern California) the group is called Ōta’s Party of Heaven and Earth (OPHE; 大田天地の会).

2500|$|In [...] "Homefront", the mistrust {{generated}} by the shapeshifters continues, with Captain Sisko suspecting his own father and recommending {{a state of emergency}} be declared on Earth. In [...] "Paradise Lost", some Starfleet officers go further and attempt to implement a coup d'état against the President of the Federation after it is revealed that shapeshifters have infiltrated Earth and committed a terrorist attack. This leads to an armed conflict between Starfleet vessels {{for the first time in}} a century, according to the Star Trek in-universe timeline. Sisko is able to force Admiral Leyton to abandon his efforts to impose martial law by telling him: [...] "You're fighting the wrong war!" [...] Behr's favorite line from the episode is [...] "Paradise never seemed so well-armed", highlighting one of many occasions when Deep Space Nine <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the practical issues revolving around maintaining the peaceful culture of the Federation and the moral or immoral choices made to achieve this ideal.|$|E

2500|$|Firstly, it {{all depends}} who {{has to pay for}} the cost, and what kind of {{sanctions}} there are for polluters. If the state pays the cost out of general taxes, the costs to individual private enterprises would be much lower compared to their gains. It may be that some businesses gain from an environmentally friendly policy, while others do not, so that they are in competition with each other. Mathematicians <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the costs of clean air and water are only a very small component of total capital costs, but some argue that corporations are profitable precisely because they do not pay for externalities. According to Leontief Prize winner Duncan K. Foley, the perception that curbing greenhouse gases is [...] "costly" [...] assumes that capitalism is [...] "efficient" [...] without such controls, but if externality costs exist, it means precisely that capitalism is not at all operating at its [...] "efficiency frontier".|$|E
2500|$|Sacchini {{was the son}} of {{a humble}} Florentine cook (or coachman), Gaetano Sacchini. At the age of four, he moved with his family to Naples as part of the entourage of the infante Charles of Bourbon (later to become King Charles III of Spain). The young Sacchini's talent for music caught the {{attention}} of Francesco Durante, who enrolled him in the Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto at the age of ten. Here Durante and his assistant Pietrantonio Gallo taught Sacchini the basics of composition, harmony and counterpoint. Sacchini also became a skilled violinist under the tuition of Nicola Fiorenza as well as studying singing under Gennaro Manna. Sacchini was one of the favourite pupils of Durante, a hard teacher to please. It was said that Durante <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the young Sacchini to his fellow pupils, warning them that he would be a difficult rival to beat and urging them to try to match him, otherwise Sacchini would become the [...] "man of the century." ...|$|E
2500|$|The records {{contained}} the official testimony from Colonel R.S. Sarkisov and Colonel V. Nadaraia, two of Beria's most senior NKVD bodyguards. They stated that on warm nights {{during the war}} years, Beria was often driven slowly {{through the streets of}} Moscow in his armored Packard limousine. He <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> young women to be detained and escorted to his mansion where wine and a feast awaited them. After dining, Beria would take the women into his soundproofed office and rape them. Beria's bodyguards reported that their orders included handing each victim a flower bouquet as she left Beria's house. The implication was that to accept made it consensual; refusal would mean arrest. In one incident his chief bodyguard, Sarkisov, reported that a woman who had been brought to Beria rejected his advances and ran out of his office; Sarkisov mistakenly handed her the flowers anyway prompting the enraged Beria to declare [...] "Now it's not a bouquet, it's a wreath! May it rot on your grave!" [...] The woman was arrested by the NKVD the next day.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{people have}} been {{suggested}} as having really been the Christopher Marlowe {{who was supposed to}} have died in 1593. Some examples are a Hugh Sanford, who was based with the Earl of Pembroke at Wilton House in Wiltshire and a Christopher Marlowe (alias John Matthews, or vice versa) who surfaced in Valladolid in 1602, and a Monsieur Le Doux, a spy for Essex, but working as a [...] "French tutor" [...] in Rutland in 1595. Henry Watterson's almost certainly fictional [...] of an Englishman called Marlowe who died in Padua in 1627 has nevertheless triggered research by some Marlovians among the Paduan archives, without finding any confirmation so far. And if Don Foster's hypothesis is correct that the [...] "begetter" [...] of the Sonnets may have meant the poet himself, then Marlovians <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that [...] "Mr. W.H." [...] might not have been a misprint, as Foster suggests, but merely showed that the identity being used by Marlowe in 1609 (including the name [...] "Will"?) most probably had those initials too.|$|E
2500|$|Among Allen's {{signature}} jokes was {{a dialogue}} in which Allen would claim {{that she was}} born in 1906, her foil would press her for proof or corroborating information; she would say that her birth certificate had been destroyed in the earthquake, her foil <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that {{she was born in}} July but the earthquake was three months earlier in April, and Allen would simply smile and reply [...] "Well, it was an awfully big earthquake." [...] The most reliable information comes from the U.S. Census data collected on June 1, 1900. According to the information in the Census records for the State of California, City and County of San Francisco, enumeration district 38, family 217, page 11-A, one Grace Allen—daughter of George and Maggie Allen, and youngest sister of Bessie, Hazel and Pearl Allen—was born in California in July 1895. In the census taken on April 15, 1910, however, for San Francisco's 39th Assembly District, Enumeration District 216, Page 5A, Grace Allen is listed as being 13 (instead of 14), indicating a birth year of 1896, but this is not dispositive and census records do occasionally vary from year to year based upon numerous factors.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{turned his}} satire on Englishmen abroad and actresses at home, Foote pointed his daggered pen towards himself, other writers and the {{condition}} of the [...] "starving writer" [...] in his play The Author which premiered at Drury Lane on 5 February 1757. The plot concerned a poor author's father who disguises himself in order to spy on his son. Again, Foote created the role of Cadwallader for himself and used it to satirize John Apreece, a patron of authors. While critics derided Foote's attack on Apreece, audiences flocked to the theatre. Apreece even appeared and sat [...] "open-mouthed and silly, in the boxes, to the delight of the audience, and mystified by the reflection of himself, which he beheld on the stage." [...] Foote noted later that Apreece finding [...] "the resemblance [...] too strong, and the ridicule too pungent [...] occasioned an application for the suppression of the piece, which was therefore forbidden to be anymore performed." [...] The play was forbidden further productions by the Lord Chamberlain. While success may have been limited, Richard Brinsley Sheridan adapted the plot in his School for Scandal. Modern critics <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that The Author shows great development in Foote's ability in creating characters and sustaining plot.|$|E
