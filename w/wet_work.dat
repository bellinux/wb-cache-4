40|$|Background objectives: Nursing {{is known}} for its high {{prevalence}} of hand dermatitis, mainly caused by the intense exposure to <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> in nursing activities. We aimed to study the characteristics of <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> exposure in nursing. Method: Trained observers monitored the duration and frequency of different <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> activities in 45 randomly chosen nurses from different wards during a morning shift, using a method of continuous observation based on labour-observation techniques. Results: <b>Wet</b> <b>work</b> in intensive care units accounted for 24 % of the overall morning shift duration, with a frequency of 49 incidents. This was 16 % in dialysis wards, with a frequency of 30 incidents, and 9 % on regular wards, with a frequency of 39 incidents. The <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> activities had short mean duration cycles. The mean duration of occlusion by gloves was 3. 1 min on regular wards and 6. 7 min in intensive care units. Discussion: The characteristics of <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> in nurses differed substantially, depending on the ward. According to the German regulation TRGS 531, our observations classify nursing as a <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> occupation, due to the frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> rather than its duration. The mean duration of occlusion in our observations was short, which makes an occlusion-induced irritating effect doubtful. Reduction in <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> exposure in nursing on regular wards could focus on the reduction of the frequency of hand-washing and patient-washing. We suggest increasing the use of gloves for patient washing. Although this will increase exposure to occlusion from gloves, it may reduce the frequency of exposure to water and soap by about a quarter...|$|E

40|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>work</b> is {{the main}} cause of {{occupational}} contact dermatitis in the cleaning industry. Dermatologists and occupational physicians need to base their primary and secondary prevention for workers in the cleaning industry on the characteristics of <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> exposures. We quantified the burden of <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> in professional office cleaning activities with a continuous standardized observation by trained observers of 41 office cleaners. Duration and frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> exposure and of different cleaning activities were assessed. <b>Wet</b> <b>work</b> made up 50 % of such cleaning work. Within a typical 3 -hr shift, a mean frequency of 68 episodes of <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> was observed, which classifies office cleaning as <b>wet</b> <b>work.</b> Skin exposure to irritants was markedly different among cleaners who did the same cleaning activities. Reduction in skin irritation can be achieved by training the workers. Because this group of workers, who have a low level of education, has a high risk of developing irritant hand dermatitis, a special effort on training and instruction should be made. A reduction of exposure can be achieved by: using gloves more often; using gloves for a shorter period of time; using gloves while doing activities that otherwise cause the skin to be in contact with water and cleaning substances and washing hands with water only, reserving soap for when the hands are visibly dirty.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of Australian workers who were exposed to high levels of <b>wet</b> <b>work,</b> and the risks involved. Occupational exposure of the hands to liquids, either through frequent hand-washing or through immersion of the hands in liquids is known as ‘wet work’. Previous studies have found that a high frequency of hand-washing at work and prolonged duration of exposure to liquids is associated with the onset and exacerbation of occupational contact dermatitis of the hands. Although a number of occupations and some industries are associated with an increased risk of occupational contact dermatitis there is little information on the patterns of exposure to liquids in the general working population in Australia, either through self-reported data or objective observation. To address this, the National Hazard Exposure Worker Surveillance survey was undertaken in 2008. This survey asked 4500 Australian workers to estimate the number of times they washed their hands while at work and how long their hands were immersed in liquids while at work. The survey also asked about exposure to chemicals and about the provision of controls to avoid or reduce the health consequences of <b>wet</b> <b>work.</b> This report {{provides a}} detailed description of Australian workers who were exposed to high levels of <b>wet</b> <b>work.</b> Of these, female workers, workers of lower occupational skill and those workers who also reported exposure to chemicals {{were more likely to report}} high levels of <b>wet</b> <b>work.</b> Workers in the Health and community services and the Accommodation, cafes and restaurants industries were most likely to report high <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> exposure.

40|$|Background. The Australian National Hazard Exposure Worker Surveillance (NHEWS) Survey 2008 was a {{cross-sectional}} survey {{undertaken by}} Safe Work Australia {{to inform the}} development of exposure prevention initiatives for occupational disease. This is a descriptive study of workplace exposures. Objectives. To assess the occupational and demographic characteristics of workers reporting exposure to <b>wet</b> <b>work.</b> Methods. Computer-assisted telephone {{interviews were conducted with}} 4500 workers. Two <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> exposure outcomes (frequent washing of hands and duration of time spent at work with the hands immersed in liquids) were analysed. Results. The response rate for the study was 42. 3 %. For hand-washing, 9. 8 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 8. 9 – 10. 7] reported washing their hands more than 20 times per day. For immersion of hands in liquids, 4. 5 % (95 % CI 3. 9 – 5. 1) reported immersion for more than 2 hr per day. Females {{were more likely to report}} exposure to frequent hand-washing than males [odds ratio (OR) 1. 97, 95 % CI 1. 49 – 2. 61]. Workers in the lowest occupational skill level jobs were more likely to report increased exposure to hands immersed in liquids than those in the highest (OR 6. 41, 95 % CI 3. 78 – 10. 88). Workers reporting skin exposure to chemicals were more likely to report exposure to hand-washing (OR 3. 68, 95 % CI 2. 91 – 4. 66) and immersion of the hands in liquids (OR 4. 09, 95 % CI 2. 92 – 5. 74). Conclusions. Specific groups of workers reported high levels of exposure to <b>wet</b> <b>work.</b> There were differences between the profiles of workers reporting frequent hand-washing and workers reporting increased duration of exposure to hands immersed in liquids.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the nature and}} the quantity of work-related skin exposure in occupations where ‘wet work’ is performed. Activities that cause one or both hands to become wet, in contact with detergents or other skin irritating substances or activities {{that need to be}} done with occlusive gloves are considered to be <b>wet</b> <b>work.</b> Employment sectors with much <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> are known to have many employees with skin complaints caused or worsened by the occupational exposures. In the first chapters the occurence of occupational dermatoses in some typical <b>wet</b> <b>work</b> occupations are described. In The Netherlands the occupational physician should recognise occupational relevant health problems, such as occupational dermatoses, and give advice on primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Unfortunately many occupational physicians, also in industries with much <b>wet</b> <b>work,</b> are not confronted with employees with occupational dermatoses. Skin complaints lead to sick leave in a late stage of the disease, therefore occupational physicians who only focus on absenteeism will miss many of these occupational diseases. The occupational physician will have to use other methods than absence registration to detect patients with work related skin diseases. Amethod enabling an occupational physician to screen employees on work related skin diseases and on a predisposition for developing such skin diseases, was studied. The findings of these assessments were translated into an advice, aimed at avoiding hand dermatitis. The efficacy of this advice in terms of reducing skin irritation was evaluated in a laboratory situation. The focus was on the health-care sector, {{which is one of the}} sectors which have a high prevalence of work-related skin complaints (from here onwards in the text the term ‘skin complaints’ will be used for current skin problems as well as skin problems in the last year) ...|$|E
