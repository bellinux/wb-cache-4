40|$|We {{have to stop}} climate change, {{and we have to}} do it quickly. To do it, we {{will need}} 150 million new jobs {{globally}} for at least twenty years. There are now campaigns in several countries fighting for mass government programs for climate jobs. Most of them started <b>with</b> <b>union</b> <b>support,</b> and all of them are trying to build an alliance of unions, environmentalists, NGOs, and faith groups. This booklet has been produced by several of these campaigns, because we want people in other countries to do the same. The first half of this booklet explains the idea of climate jobs in broad strokes. But each country is different, so the second half of this booklet sketches what climate jobs would mean in South Africa, Norway, Canada, New York State, and Britain. This report is a work in progress. As our movement grows, we will revise it and add new case studies. If you want to get in touch with us, email globalclimatejobs@gmail. co...|$|E
40|$|Recent concerted {{efforts of}} {{government}} and business to privatize public education are well-documented, but less {{attention has been paid}} to what these trends are likely to mean for the future of teaching and teacher education. Based on a review of two reports offering recommendations for reshaping teacher education, of a variety of relevant financial data, of efforts to implement scripted materials in classrooms, and of overt hostility toward the NEA, the authors argue that efforts to undermine teaching as a highly-skilled profession <b>with</b> <b>union</b> <b>support</b> are already well underway. Much evidence suggests that current "reform " strategies are intentionally driving well-educated professionals from the classroom and that once a teaching shortage has been exacerbated, teaching will be virtually fully deskilled. At this point, "teaching " will be provided by alternate "delivery mechanisms " that make teachers virtually obsolete. These developments are desirable to business and government first, because privatization of education will not produce maximum profits until labor costs are reduced, and second, because professional teachers largely oppose the lie that standards and accountability as they are being implemented will benefit poor children. Stakeholders—most especially the education community—need to understand, publicly name, and then oppose current threats to the teaching profession which play a role in the privatization efforts that threaten not only public education but democracy itself...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{snapshot}} of employee reactions to a pending acquisition at a specific point in the acquisition process [...] -four months after the acquisition announcement and two weeks prior to a final shareholder vote to accept the offer. Two hundred and ninety-three union and non-union employees responded to a questionnaire measuring their reactions of psychological stress, intention to leave, "merger syndrome" (a new measure developed from the literature for this study), and trust in acquirer's management. Respondents also completed measures of organizational identification, threat to continued employment, job involvement, union identification and union support of the pending acquisition (the last two were collected for union employees only). The data were submitted to hierarchical regression analyses, examining the direct effects of the dependent measures (psychological stress, intention to leave, merger syndrome, and trust in acquirer's management) on the independent variables (organizational identification, threat to continued employment, job involvement, and union identification), {{as well as the}} interactions with threat and union support. Unexpectedly, psychological stress was not significantly influenced by any of the independent variables. High levels of organizational identification were related to increased merger syndrome levels, as expected, but the increased trust in acquirer's management and reduced intention to leave were in the opposite direction of the prediction. Threat to continued employment only acted as a moderator with job involvement on the merger syndrome, with low job involved employees under threat reporting more merger syndrome. As expected, threat was related to increased intention to leave and lower trust in acquirer's management. High job involvement was associated with lower intention to leave and higher trust in acquirer's management. There were no direct effects of union identification, but it did interact <b>with</b> <b>union</b> <b>support</b> on merger syndrome and trust in acquirer's management. High levels of union identification and high union support for the acquisition unexpectedly lead to higher levels of merger syndrome, while high levels of union identification and high union support lead to higher trust in acquirer's management. The limited findings for organizational identification are discussed in light of social identity theory and effective merger management...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Shaffer 2 ̆ 7 s {{statement}} portrays {{an emerging}} vision of union organizing {{that represents a}} dramatic departure from the way most unions have been organizing workers for the past 40 years. Borrowing from the city wide structures of the Knights of Labor in the 19 th century, {{a new breed of}} union organizers is experimenting with a brand of unionism that may ultimately recast labor as a community-wide movement which tackles workplace issues. Unlike the now defunct Knights, these modern-day champions of community-based union organizing maintain close ties <b>with</b> <b>unions</b> across the country through their affiliation <b>with</b> resourcerich national <b>unions.</b> Many believe that this mixture of community organizing <b>with</b> national <b>union</b> <b>support</b> will spawn a new wave of union growth...|$|R
50|$|<b>With</b> labor <b>union</b> <b>support,</b> in 1896 Steunenberg was {{nominated}} {{as both the}} Democratic and Populist candidate for governor.

Steunenberg served during a period of considerable labor unrest, particularly in the mining industry in northern Idaho. As a result, many corporations, fearing that Steunenberg's government would not support them if there was a strike, increased their wages for workers.|$|R

Former California Governor Jerry Brown, {{who had run}} for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980 {{while he was still}} Governor, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was still relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed however, when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton rebutted the story by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton.|$|R

25|$|A staunch anti-communist, Woll {{eventually}} became a confidant of AFL president Samuel Gompers and other like-minded labor leaders such as William Green of the United Mine Workers of America. Green in particular relied heavily on Woll for advice and policy guidance during his term {{as president of the}} AFL. Woll also became a mentor to Jay Lovestone, the one-time Communist who was expelled from the party only to become a rabid Red-baiter and AFL-CIO foreign policy advisor. In 1944, the AFL-CIO established the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC) to assist free trade unions abroad, particularly in Europe. Lovestone was named its secretary, reporting (in part) to Woll. Lovestone's mission was to eliminate pro-Communist unions and supplant them <b>with</b> <b>unions</b> which <b>supported</b> capitalism. The Central Intelligence Agency funneled millions of dollars through FTUC in support of American foreign policy goals.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{consequences}} of job insecurity among union members are explored. Having established that most employees have instrumental motives for joining a union, and using psychological contract theory, we hypothesize that job insecurity among <b>union</b> members correlates <b>with</b> {{a lower level of}} perceived <b>union</b> <b>support,</b> lower satisfaction <b>with</b> the <b>union,</b> reduced (affective) commitment towards the union, and a higher intention to resign union membership. These hypotheses were tested in Belgium and the Netherlands. Evidence was found to support the assumed association between job insecurity and a reduction in perceived <b>union</b> <b>support.</b> In Belgium, job insecurity was also associated <b>with</b> reduced <b>union</b> satisfaction and intention to resign membership. In neither country job insecurity was associated <b>with</b> <b>union</b> commitment. These results partly support the hypothesis that union members experience job insecurity as a violation of their psychological contract <b>with</b> the <b>union...</b>|$|R
