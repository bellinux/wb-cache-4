The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} minute of extra time, Leicester medical staff {{indicated}} they {{needed to make a}} blood injury replacement for Dan Hipkiss, and elected to bring Julien Dupuy, who had been substituted in the last 10 minutes of regular time, back onto the field as the replacement. The match officials requested the Leicester physiotherapist demonstrate an open wound by <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> blood from the cut, and satisfied the injury was legitimate, allowed the replacement. With the penalty shoot-out approaching, Cardiff decided to use a substitution to bring Ceri Sweeney, an experienced goal-kicker, onto the field in place of Jamie Roberts.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. <b>Wiping</b> <b>the</b> carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Aldaris, Zeratul, {{and the newly}} {{promoted}} Artanis work to evacuate the surviving Protoss from their devastated homeworld through a warp gate to a dark templar colony on Shakuras, where they meet the matriarch of the dark templar, Raszagal. Although the Zerg are able to follow the Protoss to Shakuras, Raszagal informs the survivors of a Xel'Naga temple {{on the surface of}} the planet with the power to scour the Zerg from the surface if activated. With Zeratul and Artanis reluctantly partnering with Sarah Kerrigan, who informs them of a new Overmind growing on Char, the player joins them in an operation to recover two key crystals (Khalis and Uraj) necessary to operate the temple. Upon their return, it is revealed that Aldaris has begun an uprising against the dark templar over their alliance with Kerrigan. The uprising is crushed, and Aldaris is killed by Kerrigan, who reveals that her motives are to ensure the destruction of the Zerg cerebrates on Shakuras so she can gain control of the Zerg herself before departing the planet. Despite knowing that activating the temple will accomplish Kerrigan's objectives, Zeratul and Artanis proceed with little other choice, <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> Zerg off Shakuras' surface.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} {{medicines}} may have local and systemic side effects. Adherence to medication protocol can be confusing and expensive; if side effects occur, the patient {{must be willing}} either to tolerate them or {{to communicate with the}} treating physician to improve the drug regimen. Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes. <b>Wiping</b> <b>the</b> eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops may result in fewer adverse effects, like the growth of eyelashes and hyperpigmentation in the eyelid.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated spirits (denatured alcohol), acetone, and Dichloromethane which is usually found {{in the form of}} a commercial paint stripper. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. <b>Wiping</b> <b>the</b> solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.|$|E

25|$|Two {{weeks later}} on October 11, 1969, a {{passenger}} entered the cab driven by Paul Stine {{at the intersection}} of Mason and Geary Streets (one block west from Union Square) in San Francisco requesting to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in Presidio Heights. For reasons unknown, Stine drove one block past Maple to Cherry Street; the passenger then shot Stine once {{in the head with a}} 9mm, took Stine's wallet and car keys, and tore away a section of Stine's bloodstained shirt tail. This passenger was observed by three teenagers across the street at 9:55p.m., who called the police while the crime was in progress. They observed a man <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> cab down before walking away towards the Presidio, one block to the north.|$|E
25|$|Three One Day International matches were {{originally}} {{scheduled for the}} tour, but the third match had to be replayed the following day since {{it had to be}} abandoned due to bad weather. As in the Test series, the ODIs were also largely dominated by the batsmen. India played a tour match against the Sri Lankan Board President's XI on 15 August, which they won by 2 wickets. The President's XI had scored 240, and the Indians responded with 243 for 8 wickets in 49.3 overs, with 95 runs coming from Rahul Dravid. The first match created some controversy when the television broadcast showed umpire K. T. Francis <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> ball on what appeared to be an Indian flag.

25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E

25|$|Legend {{holds that}} the Archangel Michael {{appeared}} atop the mausoleum, sheathing his sword {{as a sign of}} the end of the plague of 590, thus lending the castle its present name. A less charitable yet more apt elaboration of the legend, given the militant disposition of this archangel, was heard by the 15th-century traveler who saw an angel statue on the castle roof. He recounts that during a prolonged season of the plague, Pope Gregory I heard that the populace, even Christians, had begun revering a pagan idol at the church of Santa Agata in Suburra. A vision urged the pope to lead a procession to the church. Upon arriving, the idol miraculously fell apart with a clap of thunder. Returning to St Peter's by the Aelian Bridge, the pope had another vision of an angel atop the castle, <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> blood from his sword on his mantle, and then sheathing it. While the pope interpreted this as a sign that God was appeased, this did not prevent Gregory from destroying more sites of pagan worship in Rome.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen {{were put}} on trial {{separately}} {{for the murder of}} racketeer Walter Sage in the Catskills. Sage was killed with an ice pick and had the frame of a slot machine tied to his body, which was found in Swan Lake on July 31, 1937. After the Sage murder, believing he was also going to be killed, Cohen fled to California and managed to secure small roles in films. According to the chief prosecution witness, Abraham Levine, Sage was riding in a car with Cohen and Drucker when he was stabbed 32 times with an icepick as Levine and Harry Strauss were following in another car. During the assault and struggle, Drucker stabbed Cohen once in the arm as Sage had grabbed the steering wheel and wrecked the car. Levine also testified that he observed Drucker <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> icepick clean before helping dispose of the body. Cohen testified in his own defense, stating that Levine had stabbed him with an icepick as he was walking home from a casino. Cohen stated that he was assaulted by Levine and another man on Drucker's orders since he refused to pay 25% profit on a game of chance that he operated. Cohen was acquitted on June 21, 1940. Drucker, who was a suspect in four murders in the Catskills, was a fugitive for over three years, until the FBI located him in Delaware. Drucker was convicted of second-degree murder on May 5, 1944, and received a sentence of 25 years to life. Drucker died in Attica prison in January 1962.|$|E

2500|$|Officially debuting in September 2002, the BA Falcon {{was a major}} {{update of}} the AU, with Ford {{designers}} and engineers almost <b>wiping</b> <b>the</b> board clean, {{and in the process}} spending just over AU$500 million, a figure much larger than previously anticipated. The BA Falcon won the prestigious Wheels Car of the Year Award (COTY) in 2002. Its range comprised the following models: XT (formerly Forté), Futura, Fairmont, Fairmont Ghia, XR6 and XR8. Major elements of the overhaul included the development of a more effective Control-Blade independent rear suspension, a significant revamp of the car's inline 6-cylinder engine as well as two new V8 engines and, to top it all off, new transmissions. Design wise, the BA received a completely new look, with designers giving both the front and rear quarters of the car substantial work, resulting in much more contemporary, European-style design. The BA also introduced a thoroughly remodelled interior, whereby the 'oval shaped' instrument cluster was replaced with a more conservatively styled cluster. It featured a large LCD screen, situated in a [...] "satin finished" [...] centre console (Called the [...] "Interior Command Centre" [...] or ICC in short). Within a year of its release, Falcon sales had increased substantially and, for a time, eclipsed Holden Commodore sales.|$|E
