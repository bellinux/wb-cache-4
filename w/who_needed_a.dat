5|$|Information differs {{as to who}} {{replaced}} Larssen. According to Evald Solbakken, and also to the reference bibliography Norske aviser 1763–1969, the replacement was Olav Scheflo, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> stand-in, Ingvald B. Jacobsen, for the first period. According to the encyclopaedia Arbeidernes Leksikon and historian Einhart Lorenz, Trond Hegna was the editor in 1927, before he took over Norges Kommunistblad {{in the summer of}} 1927. Hegna's main job was to edit the periodical Mot Dag, but in this period the people of Mot Dag had an informal influence on the Communist Party and several of their newspapers. Scheflo formally edited the newspaper from 1927 to 1928, with Eivind Petershagen as acting editor from late 1927. In 1928 Petershagen formally took over, only to have Jørgen Vogt become acting editor later that year. Vogt took over in 1929.|$|E

Johnson, who played the 2009 season in Japan's Central League, {{was regarded as a}} hero for the Rays in the 2008 season for a game-tying solo home run in the 9th inning of a game in early September against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park.

25|$|The {{origin of}} {{typographical}} ligatures {{comes from the}} invention of writing with a stylus on fibrous material (like paper) or clay. Businessmen especially <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> way {{to speed up the}} process of written communication found that conjoining letters and abbreviating words for lay use was more convenient for record keeping and transaction than the bulky long forms. The earliest known script, Sumerian cuneiform, includes many cases of character combinations that, over time, gradually evolve from ligatures into separately recognizable characters. Ligatures figure prominently in many historical manuscripts, notably the Brahmic abugidas, or the bind rune of the Migration Period Germanic runic inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|The Walser {{emigrated from}} the Val Formazza Walser around 1240 {{at the request}} of the Lombardy rulers and the Capitanei of Locarno <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> band of mercenaries. In 1244, a noble family from Locarno and the villagers of Losone leased from the {{pastures}} around the village. Later these pastures passed fully into their possession. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the Walser colony survived almost totally isolated. The rare contacts with the outside world were more with the Val Formazza or Valais than from the rest of Ticino. The geographic isolation strengthened the independent living habits and traditions of the village. The town was frequently buried by avalanches.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{played the}} Green Bay Packers, their {{longtime}} rivals, during week five. The game was a must-win {{situation for the}} Bears, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> win to preserve any chance of winning the division. The Packers entered {{the game with a}} 4–0 record, but suffered their first lost of the season {{at the hands of a}} staunch Bears defense. The Packers took a quick lead as DeShawn Wynn rushed for over sixty yards and scored a touchdown on the team's opening drive. Cedric Benson responded by scoring a rushing touchdown, but the Packers broke the tie when Brett Favre threw a touchdown pass to Greg Jennings.|$|E
25|$|With {{a lot of}} {{luck with}} other results, Yorkshire Phoenix could have {{qualified}} for the quarter-finals with a win in this game against Leicestershire Foxes. However, as Ian Harvey's support batsmen failed to score at more than three an over until Anthony McGrath came in at five with the scoreboard on 84 for 3, their innings was eventually worth just 177 for 5 - Harvey making 77 of those and McGrath 33. In reply, opening batsman Darren Maddy anchored the innings with 72 not out, and Jeremy Snape saw off the required runs as he hit 39 off 23 balls and the Foxes won with nine balls and seven wickets to spare. Leicestershire, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> tie or better to be completely assured of the quarter-final spot, thus went through.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{procedures}} {{before the}} Hof had an adversarial character. The Hof could act as arbiter {{in cases of}} voluntary arbitration {{at the request of}} parties. Also, in a number of cases there was just one party, without an adversary, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> particular judicial or executive action performed. Examples of the latter were the conveyancing of titles of real estate, both voluntary (in case of sale) and involuntary (in case of foreclosure). The Hof acted then as Notary. Another example was the remissiebrief of people who had received a pardon in criminal cases. This remissiebrief was the certificate stating the pardon and this had to be endorsed (interineerd) by the Hof (after a procedure in which the validity of the pardon was tested, and the victims in the crime were asked if they had been adequately indemnified by the pardoned criminal).|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} round of the season, Maribor played at home against Koper, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> win to secure their third-place finish and thus qualify to the UEFA Europa League in the next season. The team from Koper had the desired score when they took the lead in the 25th minute, however, their European dreams was {{shattered}} in the last minute of the match when Robert Berić's strike from 20 meters caught their goalkeeper by surprise, for the final score 1–1. This was Darko Milanič's fourth season as the head coach of Maribor and he has led the club to their third league title during this period. After the match, the club officials and players took the trophy and carried it on to the southern platform of the stadium, below which thousand of supporters gathered to celebrate the club's record 10th league title. In honor of this achievement, the club added a permanent golden star on top of their crest.|$|E
25|$|In the 1870s {{the village}} of Killinghall, in the parish of Ripley, was {{increasing}} in size, and by 1879 had a population of 6,200 <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> church closer than the one at Ripley. Killinghall consequently became a separate parish. The endowment for this parish came {{from the sale of}} a glebe farm at Ripley. More than an acre of land for the church and its approaches was donated by Dr and Mrs Beaumont of Knaresborough, and donations were given by local landowners and friends of the project. This allowed the church committee to plan a vicarage also. Beaumont later agreed to sell the adjoining two acres of land to the committee for £200, and this was earmarked for the burial ground. The committee received a grant of £1,500 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and expected to have to raise £3,000 for a church building to accommodate 400–500 persons, and £1,500 for the vicarage. However, in return for the vicarage grant, the new vicar Reverend R.K. Smith had to pay the Commissioners £214 per annum. This sum equalled the whole of his stipend, apart from the use of the vicarage which was not yet built. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday 28–30 August 1879, a bazaar was held under the auspices of Miss Ingilby of Ripley Castle, to raise over £300 towards the cost of the church. This event was designed to attract the gentry of Harrogate, who arrived in large numbers by carriage.|$|E

500|$|Remender stopped writing Venom in August 2012 (after issue #22) {{to work on}} Captain America and {{the launch}} of Uncanny Avengers. He was {{replaced}} by Cullen Bunn, who had periodically worked as co-writer during Remender's term. The Venom character remained {{a member of the}} Secret Avengers, a series still written by Remender. In September 2012, Bunn said that Thompson would be moved from New York to Philadelphia from Venom #28. This relocation would allow the introduction of a new love interest, the superhero Valkyrie. Editor Tom Brennan explained [...] "His superhero career almost cost him everything...this is a good man with a troubled past <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> fresh start...to take his next steps in becoming the hero he was born to be." [...] Marvel editor Stephen Wacker said the location change reflected Marvel's desire to expand the Marvel universe beyond New York City. Bunn's run introduced the new character Mania, one of Thompson's students who is empowered by part of the Venom symbiote. In August 2013, Marvel announced that Venom would end with issue #42 in October 2013. Bunn was informed of the decision while writing Venom #31-#38, which he stated gave him time to bring some plot threads to a conclusion, but having originally outlined thirty issues worth of stories, there would be some ideas left to be told.|$|E
500|$|The last scene filmed was the film's first, Picard's Borg nightmare. One {{camera shot}} begins inside the iris of Picard's eyeball and pulls {{back to reveal}} the captain aboard a massive Borg ship. The shot {{continues}} to pull back and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship. The scene {{was inspired by a}} New York City production of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street in which the stage surrounded the audience, giving a sense of realism. The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects. The crew used a 50-mm lens {{to make it easier for}} the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements. Starting from Stewart's eye, the camera pulled back , requiring the key light to increase in intensity up to 1000footcandles so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp. The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The [...] dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its smooth finish.
