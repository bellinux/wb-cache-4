40|$|Coffee {{production}} worldwide {{is threatened}} by a range of coffee pests and diseases (CPaD). Integrated management options require {{an understanding of the}} bioecology of CPaD and the prevalent interdependencies within the agroecological context. The comparison of different shading systems (e. g. shade-grown vs. sun-grown coffee) and the identification of trade-offs for ecosystem services is still a matter of ongoing debates. There is little quantitative knowledge of field-level investigation on shade effects and its ecological mechanisms across environmental and shading system gradients. Considering the increasingly evident effects of progressive climate change on CPaD, the need to examine the balance of shade effects under different environmental conditions becomes apparent. With the example of the coffee growing region of Mt Elgon, Uganda, this project aimed at addressing the complexity of shading effects on economically relevant CPaD using environmental and production system gradients. The approach was designed in an interdisciplinary manner, to involve the broader context of coffee agroforestry systems. The first two chapters of this thesis dealt with general aspects of coffee smallholder farming. The diversity of existing coffee production systems was characterized along an altitudinal gradient. A typology of production systems based on indicators related to the vegetation structure was generated and classified as coffee open canopy, coffee-banana inter-cropping, and densely shaded coffee systems. The typology served as the basis for comparison across the environmental and production system gradients. In the second chapter, farmers' knowledge on CPaD and the role of shade trees was contrasted with expert knowledge and field observations. Discrepancies regarding CPaD symptomatology, management and response to shade were revealed. Tackling institutional obstacles and disentangling shading effects are therefore a priority for the improvement of plant health management. The last two chapters focused more specifically on biophysical aspects of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR, Hemileia vastatrix) and <b>White</b> <b>Coffee</b> <b>Stem</b> <b>Borer</b> (WCSB, Monochamus leuconotus). The effects of environment and production system on CLR abundance were spatio-temporally variable and either directly, interactive or indirectly mediated by microclimate. The development of <b>white</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> was controlled by the bimodal rainfall, and by altitude and shade through their effect on minimum temperature. The findings emphasize the enormous importance of micro-environments for the ecology of CPaD, not least because of its implications in the context of climate change. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Although the African <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer,</b> Monochamus leuconotus (Pascoe) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), {{is a major}} {{insect pest}} of coffee in Africa, {{there is much to}} learn about its biology. The present paper {{describes}} an original rearing method for M. leuconotus and provides unpublished biological data for the pest. The <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> colony was started with larvae extracted from infested <b>coffee</b> <b>stems</b> collected in the field. Larvae were reared on artificial diet while the adults were kept in reproduction cages with coffee sticks as feeding and oviposition substrate. Under our rearing conditions, mean adult longevity was 89. 5 d for females and 81. 8 d for males. Fecundity was 40. 7 eggs per female on average, with an oviposition period of 53 d (one female laid 151 eggs for a period of 145 d). Egg viability was low (39 %) and the incubation period was 26. 6 d. Larval and pupal survival was high (80. 9 and 88. 5 %, respectively). Larval development duration was variable, with a mean of 251. 4 d, whereas pupal development was less variable, with a mean of 26. 6 d. The rearing method described here is easily replicable and allowed a colony of <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> to be continuously maintained in the laboratory for three years.

40|$|The {{production}} of agricultural commodities faces {{increased risk of}} pests, diseases and other stresses due to climate change and variability. This study assesses the potential distribution of agricultural pests under projected climatic scenarios using evidence from the African <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> (CWB), Monochamus leuconotus (Pascoe) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an important pest of coffee in Zimbabwe. A species distribution modeling approach utilising Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) was applied on current and projected climate data obtained from the WorldClim database and occurrence data (presence and absence) collected through on-farm biological surveys in Chipinge, Chimanimani, Mutare and Mutasa districts in Zimbabwe. Results from both the BRT and GLM indicate that precipitation-related variables are more important in determining species range for the CWB than temperature related variables. The CWB has extensive potential habitats in all coffee areas with Mutasa district having the largest model average area suitable for CWB under current and projected climatic conditions. Habitat ranges for CWB will increase under future climate scenarios for Chipinge, Chimanimani and Mutare districts while it will decrease in Mutasa district. The highest percentage change in area suitable for the CWB was for Chimanimani district with a model average of 49. 1 % (3 906 ha) increase in CWB range by 2080.

40|$|The African <b>coffee</b> <b>white</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer,</b> Monochamus leuconotus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is {{a serious}} pest of Arabica coffee in Zimbabwe and other African countries. Very was known about the {{chemical}} ecology of M. leuconotus prior to the initiation of the studies described in this thesis. The objectives of this work were to investigate the mating behaviour in order to look for evidence {{of the existence of}} chemical interactions between conspecific beetles and host plants. Mating behaviour and daily activity patterns of adult M. leuconotus were characterised under laboratory and semifield conditions. Mating was initiated after the male encountered a searching female and touched her with antennae or tarsi. The activities of feeding, walking, mounting and copulation were mostly done during daylight hours with the exception of oviposition, which occurred at night. Laboratory bioassays conducted to determine whether contact pheromones played a role in mate recognition showed that males were able to complete the full sequence of behavioural activities involved in mating with both live and dead conspecific females. Males did not respond to dead females washed with hexane, and the responses could be partially restored by recoating the washed females with the hexane washings, indicating that cuticular hydrocarbons are important for recognition of sex and species. A laboratory bioassay was developed for evaluating the olfactory response of M. leuconotus to different cues. Females responded positively to coffee leaves, coffee bark scrapings and the synthetic male-specific compound of M. leuconotus dispensed in a sachet while males responded positively to coffee bark and to a combination of coffee leaves and the synthetic male-specific compound dispensed in a vial. Field trapping trials were conducted in Zimbabwe using live insect baits and the synthetic male-specific compound of M. leuconotus dispensed in polyethylene sachet and vials and different trap designs. Significant numbers of beetles were captured in traps baited with the male-specific compound, and numbers caught were further increased when certain host-plant volatiles were added, particularly (R) -(-) -linalool and methyl salicylate. Intercept panel traps and MK 2 rat traps were effective in retaining insects caught. Floral surveys conducted around coffee fields to identify alternative host plants did not give conclusive evidence on the existence of alternative host plants although suspected <b>coffee</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> symptoms of attack were observed on previously reported alternative host plants. Feeding and oviposition studies suggested that female M. leuconotus feed mostly on Rubiaceae and preferred to lay eggs on Coffea arabica, G. ternifolia, V. infausta and K. venosa. The implications of the findings in relation to possible application of chemical ecology in management of M. leuconotus are discussed...|$|R

Previous work showed that female beetles {{were attracted to}} traps baited with male beetles. Analyses of volatiles from male X. quadripes of Indian origin by gas chromatography (GC) linked to electroantennographic (EAG) recording from a female beetle antenna showed three male-specific components comprising more than 90 of the volatiles, two of which elicited EAG responses. The major EAG-active component was produced at up to 2 Î¼g hr- 1 insect- 1 and was identified as (S) - 2 -hydroxy- 3 -decanone (I) by comparison of GC data, and mass (MS), infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra with those of synthetic standards. The second component was identified as 3 -hydroxy- 2 -decanone (II) produced in part by isomerization of I under {{the conditions of the}} GC analysis, although the NMR spectrum suggested it is naturally produced at up to 7 of I. The minor component that elicited an EAG response, present at 7 of the amount of I, was identified as (S,S) - 2, 3 -dihydroxyoctane (III) from GC and MS data. 2 -Hydroxy- 3 -octanone (0. 2 - 0. 5 of I), 2, 3 -decanedione (2 of I), 2 -phenylethanol (3 of I), and octanoic acid (4 of I) were also identified in volatiles from male beetles. A general, stereospecific synthetic route to the enantiomers of 2 -hydroxy- 3 -alkanones from the enantiomers of ethyl lactate was developed. The enantiomers of III were synthesized from (E) - 2 -octene by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. (S) -(I) was attractive to male X. quadripes in laboratory bioassays, but addition of (S,RS) -(III) at 10 of I reduced attractiveness. In field trials carried out in India with sticky, cross-vane traps, (S) - and (RS) -(I) attracted male X. quadripes and addition of (S,S) -(III) at 10 of I reduced attractiveness.

The four major host plants (Cyperus spp., Panicum spp., Pennisetum spp., and Sorghum spp.) found in natural habitats were also assessed, and both the cultivated and natural habitat species occurred in four agroecological zones in Kenya. Across habitats, plant infestation (23. 2 %), <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> density (2. 2 per plant), and larval parasitism (15. 0 %) were highest in maize in cultivated habitats. Pupal parasitism was not higher than 4. 7 % in both habitats, and did not vary with locality during each season or with host plant between each season. Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) and C. flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were the key parasitoids in cultivated habitats (both species accounted for 76. 4 % of parasitized <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in cereal crops), but not in natural habitats (the two Cotesia species accounted for 14. 5 % of parasitized <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in wild host plants).

Lepidopterous <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> {{are the main}} field insect pests that attack maize, Zea mays L. in tropical Africa. A survey was carried during the long and short rain cropping seasons of 2002 / 2003 across six main agro-climatic zones (ACZs) to determine the spatial distribution of important <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> species in Kenya. A total of 474 visits {{were made in the}} seventy-eight localities conveniently chosen to represent each of the six ACZs. 189, 600 stems were checked for infestation, of which 27, 799 infested stems were destructively cut and dissected for <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> larvae identification. An average of 1. 4 <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> larvae were recovered per infested plant. 54. 5 % of the recovered larvae were identified as Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Crambidae), 39. 7 % as Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Noctuidae), 4. 5 % as Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Noctuidae) and 0. 8 % as Chilo orichalcociliellus (Strand) (Crambidae).

40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>borers</b> are {{generally}} polyphagous, attacking cultivated {{as well as}} wild host plants. Two field trials, incorporating four cultivated cereal crops and two grass species, were conducted to study colonization of cultivated crops and grasses by <b>stem</b> <b>borers.</b> The first trial consisted of maize (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.), Hyparrhenia tamba (Steud) (blue thatching grass) and, Panicum maximum (Jacq.) (Guinea grass). During the following two seasons P. maximum was replaced by Pennisetum purpureum (Schumach) (Napier grass). In the second trial P. purpureum was replaced by P. maximum. Plots (5 x 5 m) were arranged in a 6 x 6 Latin square design. Natural infestation by <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> was allowed to take place. The <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> found on host plants were Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The incidence of whorl damage, dead heart and stem damage observed indicated that all host plants were susceptible to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> attack. Cultivated host plants showed higher incidences of whorl and stem damage than the grasses. The low incidence of whorl damage on the grasses may be ascribed to larval antixenosis at the feeding site. Quicker larval development as well as increased size was observed on cultivated crops than on the grasses.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} enable test entries {{to be subjected to}} combinations of shoot fly [Atherigona soccata], <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> [Chilo partellus] and midge [Contarinia sorghicola] infestations and evaluated for resistance to 1 or more of these insects. The {{technique was}} standardized over 3 seasons by testing 220 entries consisting of 170 germplasm sources previously identified as resistant to single pests, 42 improved breeding lines and F sub(4) -F sub(6) progenies, and 8 commercial high-yielding cultivars. In general, resistant sources tended to combine resistance to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> with resistance to other pest species, and there was a higher frequency for resistance to <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> as a second component than for any other insect. IS 18551 and IS 2195 were the best entries with resistance to shoot fly and <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> and IS 22464 was the best midge-resistant line. Advanced breeding lines showed a wide range of resistance to all 3 pests and had a higher frequency of resistance to <b>stem</b> <b>borer.</b> After 2 more seasons of testing, 35 promising lines with various combinations of resistance to all 3 pests were re-evaluated in 1989 - 90. Entries were also evaluated for recovery resistance to shoot fly and <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> 50 and 90 days after seedling emergence, and for overall plant performance at harvest when yield data were recorded. Genotypes that combined reasonable levels of resistance to shoot fly and/or <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> recovered better and gave higher yields than those with good levels of resistance to midge. IS 2122 and IS 5613 were the best performing entries with yields of over 3 t/ha. PS 28060 - 3 had the best combination of resistance to all 3 pests, but grain yield was very low (1. 05 t/ha) ...|$|R

Nine large-scale field trials were conducted over a 3 -year period to determine if Dectes <b>stem</b> <b>borer</b> could be managed with insecticide treatments. Aerial applications of lambda on July 6, 12 and 15 were successful in significantly reducing adults, but applications on July 1, 20 and 24 were less successful. These data suggest that for central Kansas two aerial applications {{may be required to}} control Dectes <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in soybean. Based on our experience the first application should be made at the peak of adult flight about July 5 th and the second application 10 days later.
