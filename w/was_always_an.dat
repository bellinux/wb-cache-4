5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E
5|$|Milne had {{admitted}} to problems with alcoholism and gambling addiction {{during and after}} his playing career. He <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> enthusiastic drinker throughout his career, but he lost his passion for football after picking up an injury in 1990 and began drinking {{in a way which}} began to severely damage his health. After retiring as a player he worked at a pub in Nailsea. He appeared in court in 2010 and 2013, but was never convicted, for allegedly attacking his partner Fiona Spence whilst highly intoxicated. Milne's manager at Dundee United, Jim McLean, has since stated that Milne would have had greater success in his career were it not for his problems with alcohol and discipline. Milne died on 6 September 2015, at the age of 54, due to complications from liver problems.|$|E

5|$|In the club's {{formative}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{were run}} by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (six pence) (2½p). Albion's first chairman was Henry Jackson, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891. Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> Albion player or ex-player on the club's committee or board of directors. Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following {{the resignation of the}} previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players' summer wages from his own pocket. He remains Albion's longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937. The club's longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 1930–1965, including 15 years as chairman. He became the FA's vice-president in 1969.|$|E

Moreover, several Polish designers and stylists left a lifelong legacy of beauty inventions and cosmetics, which are still in use nowadays.|$|E
25|$|Flooding <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> {{issue for}} the Plaza and the city in general. The plaza was flooded in 1629 with water two meters deep, ruining many of the merchants located there and {{requiring}} many of the portals to be rebuilt. The project to control flooding, known as the desagüe drafted Indian men over nearly the whole colonial period, {{to work on this}} major infrastructure project. Controlling flooding meant health benefits for Mexico City residents by preventing human waste from polluting the city during floods and controlling mosquitoes, which spread disease. However, it also changed the ecological system that supported birds and fish populations and allowed for Indian cultivation of crops.|$|E

25|$|The {{deck and}} command crew (hypēresia) was {{headed by the}} helmsman, the kybernētēs, who <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> {{experienced}} seaman and was often the actual commander of the vessel. These experienced sailors were to {{be found on the}} upper levels of the triremes. Other officers were the bow lookout (prōreus or prōratēs), the boatswain (keleustēs), the quartermaster (pentēkontarchos), the shipwright (naupēgos), the piper (aulētēs) who gave the rowers' rhythm and two superintendents (toicharchoi), in charge of the rowers {{on each side of the}} ship. What constituted these sailors' experience was a combination of superior rowing skill (physical stamina and/or consistency in hitting with a full stroke) and previous battle experience. The sailors were likely in their thirties and forties. In addition, there were ten sailors handling the masts and the sails.|$|E
25|$|Political {{corruption}} {{from all}} parties {{is not uncommon}} in the South Florida metropolitan area, which consistently has one the highest crime rates in the nation, coming in first place among the ten largest metropolitan areas for both violent and property crimes in 2011. This leads to a distrust in government; South Florida, particularly Miami, which would likely wax more Democratically, often has lowest voter turnout in the state. Specifically, the public felt deceived when the majority of promises were broken related to the county-wide half penny sales surtax, {{which was supposed to}} fund many rapid transit expansions, that was passed in 2002 with about two-thirds of the vote. While many beneficial investments were made {{as a result of the}} tax, transit officials candidly admit that the core promise of new Metrorail lines <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> overstatement. It should be noted, however, that the half-penny itself was a trade off from the full penny surtax that would have generated billions of dollars over several decades, which was championed by then-Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, but fought successfully by local businessman and community activist Norman Braman.|$|E

Under the professional-amateur divide of the time, England's captain <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> amateur, and professionals, such as Larwood, were obliged to obey the captain's orders. Allen was an amateur who refused to bowl Bodyline. McCabe struck three {{consecutive}} fours from Allen's conventional fast bowling, prompting Jardine to call for Bodyline field placings. Allen refused, so Jardine was forced to drop his Bodyline attack and resort to the spin bowling of Hedley Verity and Wally Hammond.

500|$|Buckley {{wrote that}} Bowie [...] "mined sexual intrigue {{for its ability}} to shock", and was {{probably}} [...] "never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual", instead experimenting [...] "out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional. Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie [...] "created their bisexual fantasy". Sandford wrote that Bowie [...] "made a positive fetish of repeating the quip {{that he and his wife}} had met while 'fucking the same bloke'... Gay sex <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women". The BBC's Mark Easton wrote in 2016 that Britain was [...] "far more tolerant of difference" [...] and that gay rights, such as same-sex marriage, and gender equality would not have [...] "enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago".|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} {{members of the group}} attended the Escuela Elemental and the Escuela Secundaria of the University of Puerto Rico, an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches.

It tends to allow you to explore your artistic interests... There <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> air of liberation, of thinking on your own.

[...] Barker felt he was funny only in character. The BBC wrote of him: [...] "Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself 'completely boring' without a script." [...] Peter Hall spoke of Barker's skills as a dramatic actor, calling him [...] "the great actor we lost" [...] and lamented that Barker was unable to take a role in one of his Shakespearean productions. Barker, though, preferred comedy, and felt it was [...] "as good and as important as serious work" [...] and he was not [...] "dumbing down" [...] by doing it. Actor Gene Wilder compared him to Charlie Chaplin in saying [...] "no matter how farcical [...] was ... there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> element of reality to what he did."
