60|$|My {{mother was}} much troubled <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> but my father, hearing the story, approved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Dr. Cumberledge," [...] she said, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> alone, [...] "I was right! I {{have found}} out a fact or two about Daphne's rival!" ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{danger was}} over. We rode back to Salisbury. The first words Hilda said <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> were: [...] "Well, {{he has got}} away from you!" ...|$|E
60|$|When my godmother {{had held}} my hand for a little while, and chatted with me, and scolded me for having become thinner than <b>when</b> <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> professed to {{discover}} that the snow-wind had disordered my hair, and sent me up-stairs to make it neat and remove my shawl.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were more}} than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come, and in that interval, which seemed a long one, I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks. I loved my darling so well that I was more {{concerned}} for their effect on her than on any one. I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am quite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she be wholly prepared? <b>When</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> might <b>she</b> not be a little shocked and disappointed? Might it not prove a little worse than she expected? Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her? Might she not have to grow used {{to me and to}} begin all over again? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So far I had not {{mentioned}} the incident at Franzenshohe to her. Perhaps you will call my reticence contemptible; {{but the fact}} is, I feared to fall in her esteem. I could not have spoken of the plank without admitting that I was afraid to cross it; and then what would she, who was a heroine, think {{of a man who}} was so little of a hero? Thus, though I had told her many times that I fell in love with her at first sight, she thought I referred to the time <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> liked to hear me say that I believed in no love but love at first sight; and, looking back, I can recall saying it at least once on every seat in the garden at the baths of Bormio.|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} little family we left {{just as we}} left them, and Amy cried for joy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and I almost did the same.|$|E
6000|$|She ran in, and {{was running}} out again <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> Ah, my angel girl! The old dear look, all love, all fondness, all affection. Nothing else in it--no, nothing, nothing! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon as I was dressed, I {{went and}} called upon that lovely woman. She gave a shriek and pretty near fainted <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> She called me Ferdinand,--I'm blest if she didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know as well}} as I do," [...] he {{continued}} when he had relit his cigar, [...] "that Clara is not usually demonstrative. I always thought her rather a cold temperament--but the moment I put my head in at the door, I found I'd been just as great a fool on that point as on most others. Basil, the scream Clara gave <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and the look in her eyes <b>when</b> <b>she</b> talked about you, positively frightened me. I can't describe anything; and I hate descriptions by other men (most likely on that very account): so I won't describe what she said and did. I'll only tell you that it ended in my promising to come here the first thing this morning; promising {{to get you out of}} the scrape; promising, in short, everything she asked me. So here I am, ready for your business before my own. The fair partner of my existence is at the hotel, half-frantic because I won't go lodging-hunting with her; but Clara is paramount, Clara is the first thought. Somebody must be a good boy at home; and now you have resigned, I'm going to try and succeed you, by way of a change!" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{announcement}} of my position ashore did me no harm, and I {{could see a}} change in the deportment of the whole family--not that it had ever treated me haughtily, or even coldly; but it now regarded me as more on a level with itself. We remained an hour with the Mertons, and I promised to repeat the call before we sailed. This I did a dozen times, at least; and the Major, finding, I suppose, that he had a tolerably well-educated youth to deal with, was of great service in putting me in a better way of seeing London. I went to both theatres with the family, taking care to appear in a well-made suit of London clothes, in which I made quite as respectable a figure as most of the young men I saw in the streets. Even Emily smiled <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> in my long-togs, and I thought she blushed. She was a pretty creature; gentle and mild in her ordinary deportment, but full of fire and spirit at the bottom, as I could see by her light, blue, English eye. Then she had been well-educated; and, in my young ignorance of life, I fancied she knew more than any girl of seventeen I had ever met with. Grace and Lucy were both clever, and had been carefully taught by Mr. Hardinge; but the good divine could not give two girls, in the provincial retirement of America, the cultivation and accomplishments that were within the reach of even moderate means in England. To me, Emily Merton seemed a marvel in the way of attainments; and I often felt ashamed of myself, as I sat at her side, listening to the natural and easy manner in which she alluded to things, of which I then heard for the first time.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{woman sitting}} in a chair, {{and as soon as}} <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> gave a shriek.|$|R
60|$|Laura {{was sitting}} {{alone at the}} far end of the room, her arms resting wearily on a table, and her face hidden in her hands. She started up with a cry of delight <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Presently I mustered {{the courage}} {{to return to the}} window, for even though she spurned me I loved her, and could not keep my eyes from feasting upon her divine face and figure, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> looking she again turned away.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, here's Miss Mary Hann coming up,' says Thomas, 'ask HER'--and {{indeed there}} came my little Mary Hann {{tripping}} down the stairs--her &s in her pockits; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> SHE began to blush and look hod & then to grin too.|$|E
60|$|Yes, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{watching}} them, {{and such}} fury {{seemed to take}} hold of her that I thought my hour had come.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Goyte came darting {{past the}} end of the house, her head {{sticking}} forward in sharp scrutiny. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and came forward.|$|R
60|$|I {{appeared}} at once, and leaped {{down upon the}} beach. A remarkable air of relief overspread her countenance as soon as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|As usual, I found Betty in the pineland. I {{thought she}} looked rather pale and dull...fretting about Frank no doubt. She brightened up <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> evidently expecting that I had come to {{straighten}} matters out; but she pretended to be haughty and indifferent.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Lady Erskine, in deep mourning, passed {{across the}} vestibule. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{she came up}} to me, murmured {{something}} about her poor son, and burst into tears. I led her into her sitting-room. An elderly gentleman was there waiting for her. It was the English doctor.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{delusion}} was dispelled by {{a change}} in her face. Its natural expression of surprise, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> set my mind free to feel the delight inspired by the discovery {{that she was a}} living woman. I should have spoken to her if she had not stopped me by a gesture.|$|E
6000|$|These things I {{learned in}} a flash. Then with a murmured [...] "Mr. Quatermain, my Lady," [...] the footman {{closed the door}} and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But maybe <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{after all}} {{and did not}} want to let on," [...] he thought dismally. [...] "Maybe she thought I wouldn't {{recognize}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{daughter}} of Heaven remembered <b>me</b> to-night; <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> weep, and <b>she</b> came with comfort: [...] "Sleep," [...] she said. [...] "Sleep, sweetly--I gild thy dreams!" ...|$|R
60|$|I went circuitously to Miss Havisham's by all {{the back}} ways, and rang at the bell constrainedly, {{on account of the}} stiff long fingers of my gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and {{positively}} reeled back <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow.|$|E
60|$|Almost as {{he spoke}} I saw {{through the windows of}} the hair-dresser's shop a {{familiar}} figure entering the hotel. I left Ashley hurriedly, and in a moment I was face to face with Felicia. She gave a little cry <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and it was a joy to me to realize that it was a cry of pleasure.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman who}} opened the door started a little <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> I asked for Mrs. Captain Chesters, and walked in without waiting to be told whether the lady was in or not. The woman showed me into a little parlor, and left me. Her manner plainly {{indicated}} that she suspected something was the matter with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was right}} about Dolcino," [...] she said, as soon as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> with a strange little air of triumph. [...] "He is really very ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{and stood}} still, then opened {{her arms and}} clasped me to her breast, uttering no word. A while later she spoke almost in a whisper, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is saying, Nanny," [...] Gavin broke in, almost gaily for a minister, [...] "that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> {{recently}} {{wearing a}} cloak. You know I {{have no such}} thing." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner, after all. I took back Captain Hopkins's {{knife and fork}} early in the afternoon, and went home to comfort Mrs. Micawber with an account of my visit. She fainted <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> return, and made a little jug of egg-hot afterwards to console us while we talked it over.|$|E
6000|$|Maude {{was close}} behind them. She gave an exclamation of delighted {{surprise}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and then stood gazing with shining {{eyes at the}} children, especially at Biddy, who stood dazzled by {{the glory of the}} constellation confronting her.... Matthew, too, wished to prolong the moment of mystery. It was the practical Moreton who cried:--"Let's see what we've got!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Evans, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> gushed into tears, but Mistress Pamela came {{straight}} to me, took my hand, {{and set it}} to her lips, though I strove my best to stay her from doing so. [...] "Sir," [...] said she, [...] "what do we not owe to our brave preserver, who hath brought us safe through all this great trouble!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, dancing {{about with}} a long, soft roll in her hand: [...] "Oh, oh, oh! <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> gloating {{on it at}} Shumaker's! I do wonder if it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{found on}} the table your first print of the negative. The sight of this before <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> threw her {{into some kind of}} swoon, from which, however, she recovered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel the}} same way," [...] {{announced}} the stuffed Bear. [...] "What do you suppose my friend the Patchwork Girl would think of <b>me,</b> if <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> wearing this beastly shape?" ...|$|R
