25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} accused {{of trying to}} take Australia {{back to the days of}} the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians <b>want</b> <b>our</b> immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E
500|$|At a 1998 {{reunion of}} Missouri veterans, {{many of those}} present who had served during World War II felt that, on reflection, their captain had acted correctly. Robert Kihune, a retired US Navy vice admiral, said, [...] "In wartime, courage is {{measured}} as much by one's actions as their strength of leadership during the heat of battle ... I think the leadership qualities showed by Captain Callaghan illustrate the ideal of what we <b>want</b> <b>our</b> military leaders to follow." ...|$|E

Music Radio called it a [...] "glossy ballad that would do Mariah Carey proud". Edna Gundersen of the USA Today said that their album Spice [...] "is assembly-line dance-pop", adding that [...] "only the funky 'Say You'll Be There' and touchingly cornball 'Mama' hint at depth".|$|E
500|$|Smith and the show's writers {{worked to}} give Lisa a more defined personality, {{and she has}} {{developed}} greatly during the series. In her 2000 memoir My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Cartwright wrote: [...] "with the brilliant wit of the writers and the wry, in-your-eye, honest-to-a-fault interpretation, Yeardley Smith has made Lisa a bright light of leadership, full of compassion and competence beyond her years. Lisa Simpson {{is the kind of}} child we not only <b>want</b> <b>our</b> children to be, but also the kind of child we want all children to be. But, at the time, on The Tracey Ullman Show, she was just an animated eight-year-old kid who had no personality." ...|$|E

Clinton and his wife Hillary {{requested}} that aides talk to child care specialists about how {{to communicate with the}} children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>our</b> children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood {{and we are going to}} get through this". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.|$|E

500|$|Ideas {{of racism}} and {{segregation}} also permeate the episode. Sara Gwenllian-Jones in her book Cult Television argues that, throughout the entry, [...] "the blacks are equated with aliens," [...] turning them into {{a certain type of}} [...] "other" [...] that is [...] "never allowed to fit in or feel safe". Gwenllian-Jones highlights the scene in which Dales, late one night on the team bus, wakes to see Exley's sleeping body being reflected as an alien in a window {{as an example of the}} racial comparison. She points out that, despite coming to Earth, Exley has moved from one segregated society—that of the aliens—into another. She points out that Exley, after revealing his true form to Dales, says that [...] "my people guard their privacy zealously. They don't <b>want</b> <b>our</b> people to intermingle with your people". This quote expresses a similar sentiment to the segregated mentality of the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|On {{references}} to the larger MCU, Ramirez said [...] "those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun", but {{there were times when}} the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to [...] "keep it in Hell's Kitchen" [...] and focus on issues such as [...] "the air conditioner doesn’t work at Nelson and Murdock. That’s really what we’re interested in." [...] He explained that the real life New York City [...] "has a larger than life presence" [...] with celebrities that live there—"If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street, that’s great, but then you turn the corner and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel.

500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We <b>want</b> <b>our</b> response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

500|$|The Milton Keynes {{idea was}} very poorly {{received}} by Luton fans and viewed, in Bale's words, as [...] "tearing the club from its most loyal supporters". Luton fans held protest marches and rallies throughout the 1983–84 season, and chartered {{a plane to}} fly over Kenilworth Road during one match pulling a banner reading [...] "Keep Luton Town F.C. in Luton". Some 18,000 Luton residents signed a petition against the club leaving. A consortium of local businessmen attempted to persuade Vauxhall Motors, General Motors' Luton-based British marque, {{to invest in the}} club and help with a new stadium in Luton. In Milton Keynes, some residents expressed fears that Luton's arrival in central Milton Keynes might bring with it football hooliganism and threaten local amenities. Some Luton supporters boycotted the club's first home match of the 1984–85 season in protest against the Milton Keynes plans. The wide unpopularity of the proposed move and the consistently vehement opposition from Luton's local support combined to prevent it from occurring. [...] "The directors <b>want</b> <b>our</b> support and our money," [...] said Tom Hunt, a member of a Luton fans' action group against the move, [...] "but they ignore the views of a community that wants to keep its football club. Why should fans pay at the turnstiles to help the club in business {{so that it can be}} taken away from us?" ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, a {{teaser trailer}} leaked online before its {{official}} release with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.

The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of Slate wrote it successfully built hype, while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an [...] "announcement trailer" [...] than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had [...] "hammy" [...] dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the Inception trailer. The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of [...] Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of income inequality and an [...] "Occupy Gotham" [...] campaign within the world of the story.

The official music video for [...] "Change Your Life" [...] was set to be released on 18 January 2013, but it premiered on Vevo on 31 January instead. It was filmed in two days. Scenes from the video were filmed at the Rhyl Pavilion Theatre in Rhyl when the group were performing a show there as part of their DNA Tour at the end of January in 2013. A spokesman for the theatre said, [...] "We are very proud to be featured as part of Little Mix's 'Change Your Life' video and feel it's a huge achievement for the Rhyl Pavilion".
