Allen was signed to the {{developmental}} roster of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in July 2006, and he played six games <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> season. Following his debut game, Allen was fined $300 due to an incident that involved BC Lions linebacker Carl Kidd punching Allen twice in the face. In May 2007, Allen announced his retirement to pursue his music career.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's {{marriage}} to Hadley deteriorated {{as he was}} working on The Sun Also Rises. In early 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> July. On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises. The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.|$|E
5|$|All known Daspletosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in {{formations}} dating to the middle to late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 77 and 74 million years ago. Since the middle of the Cretaceous, North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway, with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface. However, the uplift of the Rocky Mountains in the Laramide Orogeny to the west, which began during the time of Daspletosaurus, forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards. Rivers flowed down from the mountains and drained into the seaway, carrying sediment along <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> formed the Two Medicine Formation, the Judith River Group, and other sedimentary formations in the region. About 73 million years ago, the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again, and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea, represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale.|$|E

5|$|Between late February {{and early}} March 1945, with {{the advance of}} the Allied armies, all {{production}} of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>That</b> which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict {{the behavior of the}} arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{is to be used}} on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{was asked}} to write a series called Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he {{discovered}} that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir Lew Grade of Associated Television wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer {{for the first time}} on a summer replacement for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E

25|$|In theory, if {{the right}} tools were available, it would be {{possible}} to eradicate all infectious diseases that reside only in a human host. In reality there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> make their potential eradicability more or less likely. Three indicators, however, are considered of primary importance in determining the likelihood of successful eradication: that effective interventional tools are available to interrupt transmission of the agent, such as a vaccine; that diagnostic tools, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, be available to detect infections that can lead to transmission of the disease; and that humans are required for the life-cycle of the agent, which has no other vertebrate reservoir and cannot amplify in the environment.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church {{regards the}} bodies of all saints as holy, made such by {{participation}} in the Holy Mysteries, especially the communion of Christ's holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the Church. Indeed, that persons and physical things can be made holy is a cornerstone {{of the doctrine of}} the Incarnation, made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints' relics through the many miracles connected <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> have been reported throughout history since Biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{engineering}} {{work in the}} form of sea barriers constructed by the Roman Empire, much of East Anglia remained marshland and bogs until the 17th century. From this point onward a series of systematic drainage projects, mainly using drains and river diversions along the lines of Dutch practice, converted the alluvial land into wide swathes of productive arable land. In the 1630s thousands of Puritan families from East Anglia settled in the American region of New England, taking much East Anglian culture <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> can still be traced today. East Anglia, which based much of its earnings on wool, textiles, and arable farming, was a rich area of England until the effects of the Industrial Revolution saw manufacturing and development shift to the Midlands and the North.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of 2006, Tim Olsen was asked to leave the band. Mathieu Vilandré, who had {{previously}} filled in on drums, took over the position permanently and recording began for the next full-length album in February. Early in the recording process, the band was contacted by Relapse Records and secured a three-album deal <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> would start with their next album. In the interim, the Collection of Splits 2002-2004 was released by Great White North Records which exposed fans {{to some of the}} band's music that was more difficult to acquire due to limited pressings. It included all of the material from the splits released between Backstabber Etiquette and Legacy of Hopelessness (with Subcut, Sergent Slaughter, Feeble Minded and Sylvester Staline) as well as enhanced MP3 tracks from some earlier splits.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason was}} the {{improved}} {{capacity of the}} U2 tunnel that was needed to accommodate the U3 traffic. Current subway lines in Nuremberg are built for a train frequency of 200 seconds or 3 minutes (sole exception: Ziegelstein-Flughafen: 400 seconds), which is already fully used on the U1 {{during the day and}} on the U2 during morning rush hour. With the new ATC system in place, additional (virtual) blocks will exist between stationary block signals, thus increasing line capacity to a train frequency of 100 seconds. However, these new blocks can only be used by ATC-operated trains since they are virtual and have no stationary signal associated <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> can be observed by a driver-operated train without ATC equipment. Thus the increased line capacity can only be effectively used after the U2 has been converted to full ATC operation.|$|E

They told her that when the Israelites came to the land, she was to bind in her window the scarlet rope by which she let the spies down and gather her family into her house for safety, as all who ventured out of the doors of her house would die.
