She tells glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), complaining {{that she is}} {{doing most of the}} work, exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn (Cory Monteith), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck, Brittany (Heather Morris), and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week: each club member <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> solos, and each must choose a song that best represents their feelings.|$|E

25|$|Arthur's lack of {{employment}} becomes {{a huge problem}} for him in 1986 when his daughter, Michelle, announces her engagement to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt). Desperate to give his daughter a wedding that the family can be proud of, Arthur decides to take money from the Walford residents' Christmas Club savings scheme {{that he has been}} running. However, with Christmas fast approaching, Arthur realises that he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something to explain the lack of money in the account to everyone that contributed. Arthur announces to the members that he has withdrawn the money, then stages a fake burglary at his house and tells the police that the Christmas Club money has been stolen. However, Arthur's attempts to make the robbery look legitimate fail, and the police soon realise that Arthur is the culprit. When questioned by the police, he confesses and after his arrest he becomes severely morose, withdrawn and depressed. This culminates in Arthur finally having a nervous breakdown on Christmas Day and smashing his living room in a violent rage. By early 1987, Arthur has become so despondent that he is admitted to hospital. He returns the following spring to stand trial for the theft of the Christmas Club money. Despite Arthur having the whole community behind him, he is sent to prison for 28 days. After his release, he makes things worse by borrowing money from a loan shark.|$|E

Vincent Steckler, Avast Software CEO said [...] "MSE is not the silver bullet {{but it is also}} not the bad sequel to One Care that some claim." [...] A representative of AVG Technologies stated, [...] "We view this as a positive step for the AV landscape. AVG has believed in the right to free antivirus software for the past eight years." [...] However, AVG raised the issue of distributing the software product and said, [...] "Microsoft <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more than simply make the product available," [...] adding that integration of Microsoft Security Essentials with Microsoft Windows would be a violation of competition law. McAfee, Sophos and later Trend Micro affirmed that an antitrust lawsuit would surely have followed if Microsoft had bundled the product with Windows.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Lohan had two lead roles. The first film, Disney's teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, {{earned a}} {{domestic}} box office total of $29million, with Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo commenting {{that it was}} [...] "well above expectations as it was strictly for young girls." [...] But the film did not meet with critical acclaim. Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "though still a promising star, Lohan <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions." [...] Her second lead role that year, in the teen comedy Mean Girls, marked Lohan's first movie independent of Disney. Based {{in part on the}} non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes, the film stars Lohan as a previously homeschooled 16-year-old learning to navigate the social cliques of a public high school. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $129million worldwide and, according to Brandon Gray, [...] "cementing her status as the new teen movie queen." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy." [...] David Rooney from Variety said that [...] "Lohan displays plenty of charm, verve and deft comic timing." [...] Lohan received four awards at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards for Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, including Breakout Movie Star. Mean Girls also earned her two awards at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. With Mean Girls, Lohan's public profile was raised significantly. Vanity Fair described how she became a household name. Paparazzi began following her and her love life and partying became frequent targets of gossip sites and the tabloid media. Following Mean Girls, which was scripted by former [...] "Not Ready For Prime Time Actress" [...] Tina Fey and featured several other veterans of Saturday Night Live's [...] "Not Ready For Prime Time Company," [...] Lohan hosted the show three times between 2004 and 2006. In 2004, when Lohan was 17, she became the youngest host of the MTV Movie Awards and in 2006 she hosted the 2006 World Music Awards.|$|E

Earlier the Spanish Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences and said it shared the pain of families and loved ones of the 298 victims. Spain hopes an investigation can explain the circumstances of the accident as quickly as possible and we urged the parties involved to participate fully in the investigation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E
2500|$|By way of {{a letter}} dated 15 March 1993, the Postulation for the Cause {{received}} news about the miraculous cure of Dr. Manuel Nevado Rey from cancerous chronic radiodermatitis, an incurable disease, {{which took place in}} November 1992. The reported miracle, apparently brought about by Escrivá's intervention, was ruled valid by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and approved by Pope John Paul II during December 2001, enabling the canonization of Escrivá. John Paul II, who frequently expressed public endorsement of Opus Dei and its work, canonized Escrivá on 6 October 2002. [...] The canonization Mass was attended by 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world, general superiors of many orders and religious congregations, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During the days of the canonization event, Church officials commented on the validity of the message of the founder, repeating John Paul II's decree Christifideles Omnes on Escrivá's virtues, which said that [...] "by inviting Christians to be united to God through their daily work, which is something men <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and find their dignity in as long as the world lasts, the timeliness of this message is destined to endure as an inexhaustible source of spiritual light, regardless of changing epochs and situations." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mixed}} reviews critics {{generally}} praised Lewis's voice but criticised the music. Lyndsey Winship from BBC Music complimented Lewis's vocal ability but perceived {{a lack of}} [...] "hooks, innovation and personality". On Lewis's vocals Robert Christgau commented [...] "The subtle flutter of her finest melismatics could give an open-minded person goose bumps. Her coarser melismatics, however, are the usual showoff BS and probably also a commercial prerequisite, like not having a harelip." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Lewis's voice but criticised the mixture of styles within the album. The New York Timess Nate Chinen felt the album did {{not live up to}} the standards of lead single [...] "Bleeding Love", but was successful in showcasing Lewis's vocal capabilities. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was disappointed, saying [...] " [...] has clearly invested every scrap of energy into these songs [...] but being able to belt 'em out is only half the story, and if there's a personality here, it's well hidden." [...] Victoria Segal of The Times praised Lewis's voice, but criticised the music, saying [...] " [...] has a powerful voice but on Spirit it seems to have paralysed her collaborators creatively. Instead of taking the opportunity to craft it into new and exciting shapes, it has been stuck in a big spotlit display case, revolving slowly and rather boringly on a velvet cushion of overstuffed balladry." [...] She concluded by saying, [...] "If Lewis is looking for the greatest love of all – public adoration – she <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> better than this." ...|$|E
