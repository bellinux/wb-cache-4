25|$|Iverson, {{last man}} in, {{arrived on the}} scene with his old battle-axe bat. This bat, which must be one of the strangest ever to make an {{appearance}} in a Test match, is bolstered up with a solid slab of leather bound firmly round the blade. It has the colour of a very old violin. Its handle is so pliable that it can be twisted in all directions.

25|$|He was {{introduced}} to amateur sumo when he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> Through his judo coach Riho Rannikmaa, and an official from the Kagoshima Prefecture Sumo Association, Kazuo Kurazono, encouraged him to join the professional sport. Due to the restrictions on foreigners entering sumo, the only stable with a place available was Mihogaseki. He was given the shikona or fighting name of Baruto, {{a reference to the}} Japanese name of the Baltic sea, and made his professional debut in May 2004. He moved very quickly up the rankings, reaching the jūryō division after only 8 tournaments (tied for the third-fastest rise to sekitori status since 1958 when the current six-tournament-a-year format was adopted) and compiling a record of 41–8 on the way.|$|E

So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{physical}} descriptions of Kierkegaard comes from an attendee, Hans Brøchner, at his brother Peter's wedding party in 1836: [...] "I found [...] almost comical. He was then twenty-three years old; he had something quite irregular in his entire form and had a strange coiffure. His hair rose almost six inches above his forehead into a tousled crest that gave him a strange, bewildered look." [...] Another comes from Kierkegaard's niece, Henriette Lund (1829–1909). When Søren Kierkegaard <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> he [...] "was of slender and delicate appearance, and ran about in a little coat of red-cabbage color. He {{used to be called}} ‘fork’ by his father, because of his tendency, developed quite early, toward satirical remarks. Although a serious, almost austere tone pervaded the Kierkegaard’s house, I have the firm impression that there was a place for youthful vivacity too, even though of a more sedate and home-made kind than one is used to nowadays. The house was open for an 'old-fashioned hospitality'" [...] (1876).|$|E

[...] Mauer {{had been asked to}} leave his T-ball league at the age of four, because he was hitting the ball too hard for the other players. [...] "Another guy that came from Cretin-Derham Hall, Paul Molitor, was very similar, [...] had a good short swing", O'Neill said. [...] "And they're both able to wait on the ball so long because they don't have the big swing.
