50|$|The frame {{position}} {{can usually}} be adjusted {{with respect to the}} skate, to adjust for a skater's individual foot, ankle and leg characteristics. Frame positioning is very critical as even a minor change from the skater's actual frame position can lead to severe foot pain. Also, many times it leads to 'locking' of the skater's ankle and/or calf muscle, thereby restricting its movements. It may take a skater several days to weeks to test and adjust the frame position of his new skates. The typical Inline mounting is 195mm, which is different from the ice mounting of 165mm. The frame usually mounts three, four, or five polyurethane wheels. The three <b>wheel</b> <b>frames</b> are used by skaters with small feet, otherwise 4 <b>wheel</b> <b>frames</b> are commonly used, with 90 mm to 110 mm diameter <b>wheels.</b> Five-wheel <b>frames</b> with smaller <b>wheel</b> have lost favor.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} for the precise grinding of crankshaft pin is presented. In which, noncircular following strategy is investigated {{based on the}} motion model consists of horizontal feeding axis, additional lifting axis for <b>wheel</b> <b>frame,</b> and the active rotary axis for workpiece. The straight line relationship of wheel center, pin center and grinding point is ensured by the synchronism between standard arc interpolation motion of <b>wheel</b> <b>frame</b> and eccentric circular motion of pin section. Comparing with traditional tangential point tracing scheme, both constant grinding line-speed and simple control algorithm are fulfilled simultaneously. The negative effect of perpendicular deviation introduced by lifting axis is kinematically analyzed {{as well as the}} dynamic response error of servo system, and solving methods are carried out accordingly. By computer simulation and experimental test, the reported noncircular following strategy emerges good characteristics in the manufacturing of crankshaft, such as a strong adaptability for wheel wearing, simple motion control and high roundness precision...|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} the {{analysis for the}} optimal design of a conventional vehicle suspension system, consisting of a sprung mass (vehicle body) and two unsprung masses (<b>wheel</b> <b>frame),</b> accentuated by {{the implementation of a}} damped absorber to the unsprung masses. Further, the effect of the c. g. (center of gravity) location of the vehicle body is investigated. A two dimensional, four degrees of freedom linear model is chosen. Randomly profiled terrain is assumed to impart hyperbolically distributed stationary vertical random displacements to the front and rear wheels. For generalization, nondimensional design parameters are selected. Criteria for optimization include the tire-terrain normal force as an indication of vehicle controllability and ride safety, vertical acceleration of the sprung mass as a measure of ride comfort, as well as the relative displacement of the suspension components referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 rattle space 2 ̆ 2. Optimum parameter synthesis is performed, producing a family of trade-off curves represented in three dimensional space...|$|E
40|$|In {{civilian}} applications, {{the utilization}} of quadcopters increasing quickly. Still, this deployment experiences some difficulties like flying vibration and instability which lead to inaccurate data of onboard sensors. Determining the size of such inaccuracy assists in improving the future design and provides more precise understanding of data measured in copter applications. This work introduces an implementation of a quadcopter using recently developed hardware and software components. An aerial imagery system was applied {{as a case study}} to evaluate the performance of the implemented quadcopter. The quadcopter was assembled mainly from F 450 Flame <b>Wheel</b> <b>frame</b> kit, Aurdo-Pilot Mega APM 2. 6 controller and a Mission Planner as ground station software. The picked up images were stitched and then compared with the available Google Earth images. Also, the dimensions of targeted buildings and GPS coordinates of certain points were measured on the aerial images. The accuracy of aforementioned dimensions and GPS coordinates in comparing with the actual measurements has been investigated. The clarity and measurement errors found on the taken aerial images were such acceptable that make the quadcopter usage for photogrammetry is quite possible to monitor the changes taking place on the ground such as affected areas and under construction sites.

50|$|Carbon fiber {{frames are}} {{expensive}} but generally more flexible, making for a smoother ride {{at the expense}} of worse power transfer between the leg and the wheels. In general, carbon fiber frames weigh about 160-180 grams. Recently, high-end carbon fiber frames with a monocoque construction have been introduced. They offer the same level of stiffness as aluminum frames while weighing only around 130g. Aluminum can weigh from 170 to 240 grams. Frame length ranges from 2 <b>wheel</b> <b>framed</b> freestyle <b>wheels</b> (used in aggressive skating) to around 230 mm for short-framed four wheel skates (used in most inline designs), up to about 325 mm for a five-wheel racing frame.|$|R
