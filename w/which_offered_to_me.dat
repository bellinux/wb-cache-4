6000|$|... "Ems," [...] {{returned}} his Excellency, with great rapidity of utterance, [...] "Ems is a charming place, at least <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have, within these few years, quite recurred to {{the feelings of}} my boyhood; nothing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is more disgustingly wearisome than the gay bustle of a city. My present diplomatic appointment at Frankfort ensures a constant life among the most charming scenes of nature. Naples, <b>which</b> was <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I refused. Eight years ago, I should have thought an appointment at Naples a Paradise on earth." ...|$|R

I knew it; but I thought that the poison would not have acted on the monkeys, until you had eaten the dish. The fool who sold it me deceived me. Had you trusted me, I would never have done it. It was only when I saw that I was {{suspected}} and doubted, without cause, that my heart turned against you, and I took the gold <b>which</b> was <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> kill you. I swear it by the Prophet." ...|$|R

Sir James, I have heard from my father, is a proud man, and I don't much [half] like the patronising way in <b>which</b> he <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> assist <b>me.</b> And his insolent procrastination in replying to my letter has determined <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have nothing {{more to do with}} him. He'll find that I'm as proud as himself." ...|$|R
60|$|In my {{ignorance of}} the subject, I am bound {{to say that it}} may be, for {{anything}} I know, indeed I am ready to admit that it IS, exceedingly important that a clay farm should go {{for a number of years}} to waste; but I claim some knowledge as to the management of a clay farmer, and I positively object to his ever lying fallow. In the hope that this very rich and teeming individual may speedily be ploughed up, and that, we shall gather into our barns and store- houses the admirable crop of wisdom, which must spring up when ever he is sown, I take leave to propose his health, begging to assure him that the kind manner in <b>which</b> he <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> your very valuable present, I can never forget.|$|R

I am a doctor for you:and my prescription is a bullet, and then your cure will follow; if you escape that, the knapsack will do for you, or marching and exercise will put you to rights; these are additional chances. Besides, do as I do, drink tar-water; that is worth all your jalaps, and gruels, and messe." [...] At the same time, he stretched out his arm, he seized a large pitcher, which was near him, and filled a can, <b>which</b> he <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and all refusal was in vain.

6000|$|Mrs. Catherick! The name still rang in my ears, {{as if the}} {{housekeeper}} had only that moment surprised me by uttering it. While we were attending to the dog, the words of Walter Hartright's caution <b>to</b> <b>me</b> returned <b>to</b> my memory: [...] "If ever Anne Catherick crosses your path, make better use of the opportunity, Miss Halcombe, than I made of it." [...] The finding of the wounded spaniel had led <b>me</b> already <b>to</b> the discovery of Mrs. Catherick's visit to Blackwater Park, and that event might lead in its turn, to something more. I determined {{to make the most}} of the chance <b>which</b> was now <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>to</b> gain as much information as I could.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} fast," [...] {{interposed}} Mr. Ablewhite. [...] "I have a last word to say, which I {{should have said}} some time since, if this----" [...] He looked my way, pondering what abominable name he should call me--"if this Rampant Spinster had not interrupted us. I beg to inform you, sir, that, if my son {{is not good enough}} to be Miss Verinder's husband, I cannot presume to consider his father good enough to be Miss Verinder's guardian. Understand, if you please, that I refuse to accept the position <b>which</b> is <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> by Lady Verinder's will. In your legal phrase, I decline to act. This house has necessarily been hired in my name. I take the entire responsibility of it on my shoulders. It is my house. I can keep it, or let it, just as I please. I have no wish to hurry Miss Verinder. On the contrary, I beg her to remove her guest and her luggage, at her own entire convenience." [...] He made a low bow, {{and walked out of the}} room.|$|R
60|$|The old wizard took up {{the little}} assegai <b>which</b> he had <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and with its blade raked our ashes from the fire that always burnt in front of him. While he did so, he talked <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as I thought in a random fashion, perhaps to {{distract}} my attention, of a certain white man whom he said I should meet upon my journey and of his affairs, also of other matters, none of which interested me much at the time. These ashes he patted down flat and then on them drew a map with the point of his spear, making grooves for streams, certain marks for bush and forest, wavy lines for water and swamps and little heaps for hills.|$|R

"You may, at any rate, believe this, Fanny," [...] said he, [...] "that for no {{consideration}} <b>which</b> can be <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> will I {{ever put}} {{my name to}} another bill." [...] The kiss with which she thanked him for this was as warm and generous {{as though he had}} brought to her that day news of the brightest; and when he sat, as he did that evening, discussing it all, not only with his wife, but with Lucy, he wondered how it was that his troubles were now so light. Whether or no a man should have his own private pleasures, I will not now say; but it never can be worth his while to keep his sorrows private.|$|R
60|$|If I {{accepted}} Strong's {{offer it}} seemed that I must do all these things: more, I must be false to my instincts, false to my training and profession, false to my scientific knowledge. I could not do it. And yet--when did a man in my position ever get such a chance as that <b>which</b> was <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> this day? I was ready with my tongue and fond of public speaking; from boyhood it had been my desire to enter Parliament, where I knew well that I should show to some advantage. Now, without risk or expense to myself, an opportunity of gratifying this ambition was given <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Indeed, if I succeeded in winning this city, which {{had always been a}} Tory stronghold, for the Radical party I should be a marked man from the beginning, and if my career was not one of assured prosperity the fault would be my own. Already in imagination I saw myself rich (for in this way or in that the money would come), a favourite of the people, a trusted minister of the Crown and perhaps--who could tell?--ennobled, living a life of dignity and repute, and at last leaving my honours and my fame to those who came after me.|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} ad hoc {{network is}} a collection of nodes that communicate with each other {{in the absence of a}} supporting infrastucture. Approximate information protocols are routing protocols that utilize approximate, inaccurate information on nodes in order to make routing decisions. An example of such a protocol is the Last Encounter Routing (LER) protocol. We propose a network model under which we prove fundamental properties of the LER protocol and make progress towards a rigorous analysis of its behaviour. iii iv! v viAcknowledgements I wish to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Peter Marbach, for working closely with me throughout the time that this thesis was written; I would not have been able to go through this without his guidance. Also, I cannot thank enough my second reader, Professor Bálint Virág, for the most fruitful discussions that we had; indeed, this thesis would not have been possible without his help, <b>which</b> he <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with such openhandedness. Professor Jeremy Quastel provided me with a proof of Proposition 5. 2, for which I am most grateful, and Prof. Wayne Enright referred <b>me</b> <b>to</b> several sources on Volterra equations, which were indeed very useful. I would also like to thank the members my group, especially Xiaoyang Guan and Ehsan Foroughi, for the discussions that we had and for their comments on this thesis. Finally, I would like to thank my family and my friends for supporting me and bearing with me during the past year. vii viiiContents...|$|R
60|$|The {{hearing him}} say that, and the seeing how {{sincerely}} he meant what he said, {{was the first}} gleam of comfort in the dreadful affliction that had befallen us. I felt this; I felt a burning anger against the wretch who had done her best to ruin my mistress's fair name and mine, but in every other respect I was {{like a man who}} had been stunned, and whose faculties had not perfectly recovered from the shock. Mr. Philip was obliged <b>to</b> remind <b>me</b> that time was of importance, and that I had better give myself up immediately, on the merciful terms <b>which</b> his kindness <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I acknowledged that, and wished him good morning. But a mist seemed to come over my eyes as I turned round to go away--a mist that prevented me from finding my way to the door. Mr. Philip opened it for me, and said a friendly word or two which I could hardly hear. The man waiting outside took <b>me</b> <b>to</b> his companion in the carriage at the door, and I was driven away, a prisoner for the first time in my life.|$|R
6000|$|A {{phrase of}} Edward Garnett's is, {{as a matter}} of fact, {{responsible}} for this book. The first of the friends I made for myself by my pen it was but natural that he should be the recipient, at that time, of my confidences. One evening when we had dined together and he had listened to the account of my perplexities (I fear he must have been growing a little tired of them) he pointed out that {{there was no need to}} determine my future absolutely. Then he added: [...] "You have the style, you have the temperament; why not write another?" [...] I believe that as far as one man may wish to influence another man's life Edward Garnett had a great desire that I should go on writing. At that time, and I may say, ever afterwards, he was always very patient and gentle with me. What strikes me most however in the phrase quoted above <b>which</b> was <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in a tone of detachment is not its gentleness but its effective wisdom. Had he said, [...] "Why not go on writing," [...] it is very probable he would have scared me away from pen and ink for ever; but there was nothing either to frighten one or arouse one's antagonism in the mere suggestion to [...] "write another." [...] And thus a dead point in the revolution of my affairs was insidiously got over. The word [...] "another" [...] did it. At about eleven o'clock of a nice London night, Edward and I walked along interminable streets talking of many things, and I remember that on getting home I sat down and wrote about half a page of [...] "An Outcast of the Islands" [...] before I slept. This was committing myself definitely, I won't say to another life, but to another book. There is apparently something in my character which will not allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> abandon for good any piece of work I have begun. I have laid aside many beginnings. I have laid them aside with sorrow, with disgust, with rage, with melancholy and even with self-contempt; but even at the worst I had an uneasy consciousness that I would have to go back to them.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} to Zoltán Szatmáry, my friend and collab-orator, for launching this work by pointing out the weaknesses of many current phase-precession models at that time, and for the many joyful hours we spent together with elaborating on our model and writing {{the first draft of}} our article. I {{would also like to thank}} my advisor, Dr. Péter Érdi (also Kalamazoo College, MI) for asking the key question when we criticized other phase precession models with Zoltán: “How could you make them work? ” I am also indebted to him for attracting and introducing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> computational neuroscience and then supporting me in my work through so many years. Some of the simulations presented in this dissertation were carried out during my teaching and research assistantship at Kalamazoo College, for which Péter invited <b>me.</b> Also thanks <b>to</b> Gergő Orbán, for the many discussions we had on the model, as well as for never sparing his time when I asked him to critically read the dif-ferent versions of my manuscripts and this dissertation. Thanks to Zsófia Huhn for picking up the thread of my single cell modeling and doing all the detailed biophysical simulations, and to all other members of the lab for creating such a friendly atmosphere in which it was a real pleasure to work. I benefited a lot from the discussions with Dr. Alessandro Treves (SISSA, Italy) while trying to defend my position that theta and phase precession could be important for hippocampal information processing. Parts of this dissertation were written under my EU Marie Curie Fellowship at SISSA <b>which</b> Alessandro kindly <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I am especially grateful to Nicola van Rijsbergen and Kit Longden for spend-ing several hours with reading parts of this dissertation. i...|$|R
60|$|We were rivals, but I {{desire to}} treat her with scrupulous fairness, and I admit that she had one good thing, to wit, her {{gutta-percha}} tooth. In earlier days one of her front teeth, as she told me, had fallen out, but instead of then parting with it, the resourceful child had hammered it in again with a hair-brush, <b>which</b> she <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> show <b>me,</b> with the dents on it. This tooth, having in time passed away, its place was supplied by one of gutta-percha, made by herself, which seldom came out except when she sneezed, and if it merely fell at her feet this {{was a sign that}} the cold was to be a slight one, but if it shot across the room she knew she was in for something notable. Irene's tooth was very favourably known in the Gardens, where the perambulators used to gather round her to hear whether it had been doing anything to-day, and I would not have grudged David his proprietary pride in it, had he seemed to understand that Irene's one poor little accomplishment, though undeniably showy, was without intellectual merit. I have sometimes stalked away from him, intimating that if his regard was to be got so cheaply I begged to retire from the competition, but the Gardens are the pleasantest club in London, and I soon returned. How I scoured the Gardens looking for him, and how skilful I became at picking him out far away among the trees, though other mothers imitated the picturesque attire of him, to Mary's indignation. I also cut Irene's wings (so to speak) by taking her to a dentist.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2013, Rehman {{signed for}} Malayasian club Pahang FA on a two-year contract. His former club Kitchee's {{president}} Ken Ng commented [...] "Zesh has contributed hugely to Kitchee's success {{over the last}} 2 years {{and he will be}} truly missed". His new club's manager Zainal Abidin Hassan said that they were [...] "delighted" [...] as he [...] "has chosen to come to Pahang ahead of several other teams." [...] He justified his reason of joining the club as [...] "his destiny". In his first season with the club, he won three trophies - Malaysia Super League, Malaysia FA Cup and Malaysia Cup, thus winning qualification to the 2015 AFC Cup. In the cup, he played six times without scoring a goal. In 2015 Zesh helped Pahang to finish second in the Malaysia Super League, the highest finish for the club in over a decade and in doing so became the highest goalscoring defender in the league netting 6 times, he scored 8 goals in all competitions throughout the season. Pahang also created history by reaching the AFC Cup quarter final {{for the first time in}} their history. Zesh played the majority of the season in Midfield displaying his versatility to the team, performing admirably in the holding role. He played 45 from 46 games in all competitions his best career stats in a season to date.Throughout the year he also achieved some personal milestones such as playing over 300 career games across four nations and notching up 100+ games in Asia and completing five years of playing competitive football in the Asia region. He was handed the captain badge in the beginning of their season.On 28 June 2016 Zesh announce via his social media accounts he had amicably agreed to terminate with Pahang FC after a successful 3-year spell at the club.

Good luck to all the staff & team for the rest of the season. Thank you". Pahang FC were equally pleased with his contribution. Club CEO and Vice President Datuk Akbar V V Abu was quoted as saying:"Zesh served as an excellent player for Pahang for 3 years in a successful trophy winning team. His example and leadership to the young and local players was outstanding. The door for a future return is open anytime. We would love to see him back in a coaching role one day" ...|$|R
