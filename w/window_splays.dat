50|$|The {{entrance}} centers {{the entire}} main facade. It is arched, with flanking wooden pilasters topped with dosserets and a denticulated (toothed) broken-bed pediment. The <b>windows</b> feature <b>splayed</b> brick lintels and capping keystones. Two iron lantern-style lamps frame the door.|$|R
50|$|Stained glass by Clayton and Bell was installed, with a {{representation}} of Christ in Glory in the large circular east <b>window.</b> Its <b>splays</b> were enriched with inlaid and carved marble, with four heads in high relief enclosed in medallions. The other windows contained a series of stained glass images illustrating the life of Christ, with the crucifixion at the west end.|$|R
5000|$|The parish church, {{dedicated}} to St Margaret of Antioch, stands in Wangford Road, to the north-west of the village. One {{of the most}} striking features is a large, unnamed bronze angel inscribed [...] "To Fanny my beloved wife". The present building is mainly from the early 14th century. The tower was built about 1325. The chancel was restyled in the 15th century, and has many niches for saints in the <b>window</b> <b>splays.</b> The church suffered damage during the Reformation and the Civil War and was much altered in succeeding centuries.|$|E
50|$|The cathedral is {{cruciform}} in plan without aisles in {{the early}} gothic style with a massive square central tower. All the windows are lancet windows, singles or doubles, but triple lancets in the four gables. Design features include arches which span between buttress to buttress {{in advance of the}} side walls. The parapets are of the stepped Irish type (now much restored) but probably datable to c. 1395, the year in which a Papal relaxation was given to those who visited Kildare and gave alms for the conservation of the church. The interior treatment is plain, the <b>window</b> <b>splays</b> are not moulded, but the rear-arches, which are, spring from shafts with moulded capitals. These shafts are short and terminate in small curved tails.|$|E

50|$|Above these columns {{there are}} some capitals of re-employment. Two capitals have trapezoidal-plant abacus and perhaps adorned a <b>window</b> <b>splay.</b> The higher fillet {{presents}} a line of smooth ashlars on which twelve little hanging arches set, supported by little brackets adorned with zoomorphic, phitomorphic and geometric motives. On {{the bottom of the}} fountain, on a second level in respect to the arcade, you can distinguish two blocks of Roman age with some swags and a funerary epigraph dedicated to the god Mani. On its right side there is a third high-mediaeval epigraph, situated between two lion statues, referring to the building of a fountain. A deep study of the surfaces allows to verify that the blocks were worked on several occasions, with an extremely long interval, and that come from an undefined number of buildings of the town. Therefore, the handiwork represents an interesting abacus of workings, decorative elements, an exemplar of material culture with centuries of town history written on.|$|R
50|$|Dating {{from the}} Saxon era {{it has a}} double <b>splayed</b> <b>window</b> {{on the north side}} and an {{excellent}} figure of Henry of Cobham (d. 1315) to the south. The village war memorial stands just inside the main gate.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} has square-headed <b>windows</b> with <b>splayed</b> keystones; cornice between {{first and second}} floors; stone balcony on monumental {{brackets}} in front of central window of second floor; round-arched second floor windows set within concave round-arched recesses with unusual foliate keystones; square-headed windows of third floor have keystones with smooth enframement and stylized sill corbels; stone band at impost level; modillioned roof cornice with handsome balustrades; two-story slate mansard roof pierced by segmental dormers above which are bulls-eye dormers.|$|R
40|$|The report {{deals with}} the {{problems}} which {{may be caused by}} internal additional insulation of an existing building component. Problems treated in this report are heat losses through and surface condensation at thermal bridges, condensation in the building components, stresses due to temperature and moisture content variations and possibly frost damage in facade materials. After internal insulation thermal bridges such as joist connections, inner wall connections and <b>window</b> <b>splays</b> have relatively speaking an increased effect on heat losses through an outer wall. Computer calculations have been made to estimate this effect. Thermal bridges also reduce surface temperatures in a room. This way in some cases increase the risk for surface condensation. The effect is, however, relatively small. Condensation in a building component is likely to occur if the internal insulation is made without a new vapour barrier. The condensation risk is naturally greatly influenced by the climatic conditions and the moisture capacity of the building materials. Onedimensional nonstationary calculations of the temperature and moisture field in some building components before and after additional insulation have been made with a computer program. Laboratory investigations of thermal and moisture conditions in two types of walls after thermal insulation have been made. The effect of driving rain on the moisture content in an outer wall with and without internal insulation has for some cases been calculated. The possible risk for frost damage due to the decreased rate of drying out is discussed. Although internal insulation can be said to affect the frost resistance, other factors surely have greater influence. For the discussion of stresses due to temperature and moisture variations simple structural elements are used, plates with clamped and free edges, respectively. The temperature field and the moisture content before and after internal insulation have earlier been calculated. These calculations are now used {{in order to determine the}} effect of internal insulation on such stresses. Some calculations with the finite elem ent method have also been made in order to study more complex stress fields. As for thermal stresses, internal insulation affects the stress distribution in a wall rather than the maximum stress. Stresses due to moisture content variations are hardly affected by internal insulation...|$|E

Its front facade facing northeast, allowing a view of the mill property. Exterior decoration includes a Palladian window, door sidelights and leaded glass transom. <b>Windows</b> have <b>splayed</b> block lintels, scored and keyed to look like masonry. The roof line is accentuated with blocked modillions that form pediments on the gable ends. In the front is a paved terrace with broad steps descending to the lawn.|$|R
50|$|The 46-acre school {{campus is}} in two halves. The North site, {{separated}} by a public lane, has modern buildings set behind its largely administrative 17th century rebuilding of Thorpe manor house (with Georgian front elevation). The South site centers on the grand early 19th-century convent built in the grounds of Thorpe manor house, built in yellow brick featuring a two-storey splay sided bay with sash <b>windows</b> in <b>splays</b> and French <b>windows.</b> James Lander wrote an extensive history {{of the school and}} surrounding area in The Heart of Thorpe.|$|R
50|$|The crypt of St. Leocadia is a {{rectangular}} chamber with walls of rubble. It has a rude semicircular unbroken barrel vault, barely 80 cm high at the crown. Originally it was lighted by very narrow <b>windows,</b> mere loopholes, <b>splayed</b> internally, {{in the side}} walls, and by one large window at the east end.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} are of yellow brick, with a repetitive pattern of domestic scale sash windows organised within a simple arrangement of string courses and cornices, providing balancing vertical elements with <b>splayed</b> <b>windows</b> and stone quoins. Interest at street level comes from street railings that protect half basements {{and the main}} entrances to the buildings.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is {{located near the}} southern end of the built-up commercial downtown area of Springfield. It is on the north side of Main Street, between the Bangs Block to the east and the Colonial Block located across Crossett Lane. It is a five-story masonry structure, built out of pale brick with red and white stone trim. The ground floor facing Main Street has a modern storefront, while the second floor has sash <b>windows</b> topped by <b>splayed</b> lintels. A corbelled beltcourse separates the second and third floors. The third and fourth floors have <b>windows</b> topped by <b>splayed</b> brick soldier headers with stone keystones. The fifth floor windows are set in round-arch openings, and the {{building is}} capped by a projecting dentillated and modillioned cornice. The corner at Main and Crossett is styled as a three-bay polygonal section in redstone, with decorative panel blocks between the windows of each bay.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the church}} {{many of the}} <b>windows</b> are <b>splayed.</b> In the <b>splay</b> of a <b>window</b> on {{the south of the}} chancel is a 13th-century {{painting}} of a human figure. There are two monuments dating from the 18th century. On each side of the chancel arch is a round-headed squint. To the east of the door is a damaged piscina, and to its west is a 16th-century alms box that has been carved from a tree trunk. The font is Norman. It is made in Purbeck marble, and consists of a square bowl supported by a moulded stem on a square base. The other fittings date from the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the nave}} has its pews {{arranged}} around a central aisle, with wooden floors and plaster walls. Pointed arch brackets support the purlins {{of the high}} ceiling; the <b>windows</b> have deep <b>splayed</b> plain surrounds. A three-part stained glass window {{at the rear of}} the chancel depicts an elderly St. John being carried into church. The geometric colored glass window behind the organ is the only original one.|$|R
50|$|The Heywood House is set facing {{south on}} the north side of Maine Street, {{overlooking}} the Penobscot River. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a side gable roof, four end chimneys, and a dressed granite foundation. The main facade is five bays wide, its <b>windows</b> featuring <b>splayed</b> sills and lintels. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by fanlight window. Both sides of the roof feature a monitor-style dormer. A wood frame addition extends to the rear of the main block. The main block's brick is laid in Flemish bond on the front, and English bond on the sides. The front facade's brick is of uniformly high quality.|$|R
5000|$|Tara Hall is {{constructed}} from brick laid five {{deep in the}} decorative Flemish bond fashion. The bricks used in Tara Hall were manufactured in Rochester, New York and made the Lake Ontario crossing as ballast in McFaul’s schooners on the return journey after delivering agricultural produce to the United States. [...] The corners of the building are set with large tooled limestone quoins. The {{front of the building}} features wide Venetian <b>windows</b> with <b>splayed</b> stone lintels above a stone band course separating the storeys. At some time prior to the 1870s a long pagoda-roofed veranda was added running the length of the building. Only photographs and trace impressions of the veranda’s supports remain.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a Georgian era {{hexagonal}} oak pulpit. There is a carved reading desk, 19th century pews and various stone monuments. There are several stained glass windows, the east window of north aisle (1858) {{is dedicated to}} the Gascoigne family with heraldic symbols and knights set in while the chancel has a Norman <b>window</b> with deeply <b>splayed</b> sides. The chancel and nave have a 19th-century hammer-beamed roof.|$|R
50|$|The tavern {{was built}} about 1780, {{in what was}} known {{at the time as}} Stevens Corner. Its {{interior}} retains a number of important period features, including paneled fireplace surrounds, chair rails and wainscoting, and <b>splayed</b> <b>window</b> lintels; the latter is a particularly rare feature in early Rehoboth architecture. The ell was added to the left side in the 19th century. The tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The Roswell Butler House stands facing Upper Main Street (Vermont Route 15), roughly {{midway between}} the town's current {{downtown}} and its historic town center. It {{is on the}} south side of the road, a short way west of its junction with Commonwealth Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof, interior end chimneys, and a stone foundation. It is five bays wide, with a late 19th-century porch extending across three bays and around to the left side. <b>Windows</b> have <b>splayed</b> stone lintels, and the roof cornice is modillioned.

5000|$|Ravenglass Roman Bath House (also {{known as}} Walls Castle) is a ruined ancient Roman bath house at Ravenglass, Cumbria, England.Belonging to a 2nd-century Roman fort and naval base (known to the Romans as Glannoventa), the bath house is {{described}} by Matthew Hyde in his update to the Pevsner Guide to Cumbria as [...] "an astonishing survival". The still standing walls are 13 ft (4 m) high, there are patches of the internal rendering, in dull red and white cement, and traces of the <b>splayed</b> <b>window</b> openings remain.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept for}} the design dates back to 1969, but the {{contract}} was not awarded to Breuer until 1976, because of disputes between the library administration and city government over the bond referendum needed to raise the $18.9 million for construction of the library. Construction began in 1977, and when the structure was completed in 1980 it featured a 300-seat theater, six stories of library space, and a restaurant. The building was built for a capacity of 1,000 users and 1 million volumes. The structures consists of a steel frame and concrete slabs, and the exterior is composed of precast concrete panels that were bush-hammered for texture. Concrete {{was chosen as the}} material because concrete allowed for the most economical implementation of the special shapes required for the recessed <b>windows</b> and <b>splayed</b> reveals. The second, third, and fourth stories are connected by a monumental concrete staircase.|$|R
50|$|The beltcourse {{serves as}} the springline for the three round-arched windows on the second story of the cross-gable. The center window is set with stained glass while the two {{flanking}} windows have 24-light central sections, 12-pane sidelights and radiating muntins in the arch. All three are set in splayed brick surrounds topped by keystones. The pediment above is broken with a bullseye <b>window</b> set amid <b>splayed</b> brick and keystones at all four cardinal points. West of the cross-gable is another bay with the same treatment as the one {{to the east of}} it.|$|R
50|$|The terrace {{was divided}} into three stepped blocks of four, four and two houses. The ground and first floor are {{constructed}} from Portland stone separated by a narrow sting course. There {{are a series of}} tile-hung second floor bay windows to the west facade, with four low semi-circular arched entrances providing shared access for every pair of houses on the ground floor to the east facade. The second floor is jettied out from the first. To the western front a continuous slate hung roof overhangs the bays of the first floor; a finish also applied to the second floor wall to this facade. The eastern facade of the second floor is rough cast and overhangs the first and ground floors. The attic story is extended out over the second storey and is tile hung with small dormer <b>windows</b> with <b>splayed</b> lights tucked under the eaves of the main roof. The massive roof was tiled with Taylor’s patent red roof tiles.|$|R
50|$|The building, entered via central timber {{double doors}} opens {{into the ground}} floor entry {{vestibule}}. The entry vestibule has a dressing/store room to its right, and contains a fine set of carved cedar stairs with cupboards underneath. Another set of timber double doors open into the ground floor hall which has painted rough-hewn sandstone walls, timber boarded ceilings and a polished hardwood floor. The floor of the upper level hall is supported by two round timber columns and beams with decorative casings. The room is lit with timber sash <b>windows</b> with deep <b>splayed</b> dark timber reveals, and contains numerous lodge-related photos and prints.|$|R
50|$|In {{some parts}} {{the walls of}} the castle are 6 to 8 ft thick. Other {{defensive}} measures include the iron grilles which remain on some lower <b>windows,</b> and numerous <b>splayed</b> gun loops and arrow-slit windows. The rooms, some wood-panelled, are decorated with many Mackenzie portraits from past centuries, as well as antique furnishings and large-scale antique maps. Many original fittings are to be found around the castle. The grounds include two Spanish chestnuts, said to have been planted by John of Killin in 1556, to mark the confirmation of his acquisition of Castle Leod by Mary Queen of Scots.|$|R
2500|$|James Wright {{undertook}} a standing building survey of Brammer Farm House and Arundel Cottage during February 2013. The {{purpose of this}} survey was to ascertain whether any in situ medieval masonry survived within the two properties. The results [...] suggest that the boundary wall of the King's Houses survives as a spine wall within both properties up to first floor level. There is also evidence for bonded return walls to both north and south {{as well as a}} <b>splayed</b> <b>window.</b> There are five phases of development to the cottages with the earliest post-medieval builds being north of the boundary wall into the village street.|$|R
