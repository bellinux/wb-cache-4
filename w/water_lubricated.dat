40|$|ABSTRACT. Basal <b>water</b> <b>lubricates</b> and {{enables the}} fast {{flow of the}} West Antarctic ice streams which exist under low {{gravitational}} driving stress. Identification of sources and rates of basal meltwater production can {{provide insight into the}} dynamics of ice streams and the subglacial hydrology, which remain insufficiently described by glaciological theory. Combining measurements and analytic modeling, we identify two regions where basal meltwater is produced beneath Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica. Downstream of the onset of shear crevasses, strong basal melt (20 – 50 mma– 1) is concentrated beneath the relatively narrow shear margins. Farther upstream, melt rates are consistently 3 – 7 mma– 1 across the width of the ice stream. We show that the transition in melt-rate patterns is coincident with the onset of shear margin crevassing and streaming flow and related to the development of significant lateral shear resistance, which reorganizes the resistive stress regime and induces a concentration of basal resistance adjacent to the shear margin. Finally, we discuss how downstream freeze-on in the ice-stream center coupled with melt beneath the shear margin might result in a slowing but widening ice stream...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} issue in hydropower and other industries {{is the increasing}} demand for introduction of environment friendly solutions. Mineral oil based lubricants have long been used in various sliding bearings in hydropower stations. Their use in aqueous environments however raises concerns about the environmental impact if they leak into downstream water. This has necessitated research in replacing mineral oils with more bio-degradable lubricants and {{the ultimate goal of}} ‘oil-free’ hydropower generating machines. Replacing oil with water however poses many challenges. Due to considerably lower viscosity of water compared to that of turbine oils, the <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> bearings are likely to operate in boundary/mixed lubrication regime for relatively longer period. Therefore choice of the materials and their tribological performance are very important for the bearings operating in the boundary/mixed lubrication regimes. Application of compliant polymers in <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> bearings introduces many advantages which cannot be achieved with coatings (DLC, etc.) or ceramics. Most previous tribological studies on polymers have been carried out in dry conditions and only a few studies in presence of water have been reported. This work is thus aimed at investigating the tribological behavior of some selected polymer materials in <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> conditions. The results of these studies provide an insight into polymers’ tribological performance in boundary/mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication regime and associated wear mechanisms in presence of water. Polymers also enhance performance of oil lubricated bearings. Application of polymers in the oil lubricated bearings provides a smooth transition from oil lubricated Babbitt bearings to <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> polymer bearings. Therefore a part of this thesis is also aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics of several polytetrafluoroethylene based materials at the onset of sliding (break-away friction) at different pressures and temperatures. The results of this study show significantly lower breakaway friction of PTFE materials compared to Babbitt at all pressures and temperatures. SEM investigations revealed wear modes of the PTFE materials and the abrasive nature of hard fillers. Bronze-filled, carbon-filled and pure PTFE were found to provide lower and more stable break-away friction and generally superior properties compared to the other materials.
