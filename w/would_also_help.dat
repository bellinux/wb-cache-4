5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
5|$|As the {{defending}} champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semi-final {{stage of the}} 1963 Copa Libertadores. The ballet blanco, the nickname given to Santos for Pelé, managed to retain the title after victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. Pelé helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that contained Brazilian legends such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with a last-minute goal in {{the first leg of}} the semi-finals which made it 1–1. In the second leg, Pelé scored a hat-trick in the Estádio do Maracanã as Santos won, 0–4, in the second leg. Santos started the final series by winning, 3–2, in the first leg and defeating Boca Juniors 1–2, in La Bombonera. It was a rare feat in official competitions, with another goal from Pelé. Santos became the first (and to date the only) Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pelé finished the tournament with 5 goals. Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third place but {{went on to win the}} Rio-São Paulo tournament after a 0–3 win over Flamengo in the final, with Pelé scoring one goal. Pelé <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> Santos retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Taça Brasil against Milan and Bahia respectively.|$|E

50|$|Modern diapsids (lizards, snakes, crocodilians, birds) excrete uric acid, {{which can}} be {{excreted}} as a paste. It is reasonable to suppose that archosaurs (the ancestors of crocodilians, dinosaurs and birds) also excreted uric acid, and therefore were good at conserving water. The aglandular (glandless) skins of diapsids <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> to conserve water.|$|R

25|$|The hazard of {{the short}} section of single line with the single lead {{junction}} would be reduced if there were two red signals protecting it. British practice mostly has one protecting signal. New South Wales practice mostly has two red signals protecting such a junction, albeit {{at the cost of}} some reduction in train headway. Alternatively, trap points could be installed to protect the single line. Two signal protection is a relatively easy way to reduce these risks, and would have been helpful at the Ladbroke Grove rail crash. A comprehensive ATP system <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{last time}} the public {{approved}} a school building bond was in 1963. To circumvent the need for public approval for borrowing, both the county and the school district have used certificates of participation. In 2005, the board decided to build seven new schools to accommodate the 800 to 1,300 new students moving into the area annually, and renovate each of the districts schools. This <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> meet the requirement that was imposed when Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment limiting class size, starting in 2010, but phased in before then by the Florida legislature.|$|E

25|$|One of the AWC's final {{projects}} was {{the funding}} of a worker training center. Since its inception, the corporation had required that 51 percent of each developer's workforce come from the District of Columbia, and that at least 10 percent of the workforce be residents of the city's impoverished Ward 8. But developers complained that few D.C. residents were prepared or trained for the jobs offered. The AWC established an employment organization to help screen D.C. residents who applied for jobs, better match residents to positions that they qualified for, and improve residents' job skills to better prepare them for the workplace. The organization <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> promote awareness of AWC redevelopment projects and job opportunities at those projects among Ward 7 and Ward 8 residents. This organization, known as the Business Resource Center, opened at 2311 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE on April 11, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The club {{managed to}} finish in 2nd place in the 1948 edition of the Paulistão, thanks to Antoninho, Pinho and Odair dos Santos. Odair become the club's season topscorer with 20 goals; he will repeat this feat for the {{following}} three seasons. Odair and Antoninho <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> the club finish 3rd in the 1950 edition of the state competition. This {{was the first time}} Santos had two top-three finishes in three seasons in the Paulistão since the O ataque dos 100 gols generation. Santos also participated in the Torneio Rio – São Paulo {{for the first time in}} 1952, finishing in third place overall. The arrivals of younger prospects such as Formiga, Manga, Tite, Zito and Vasconcelos coincided with the retirements of Odair and Antoninho in 1952 and 1953 respectively, ensuring the club had the quality to maintain its pursuit on the State championship. Antoninho would become the club's assistant manager in 1954 with Lula becoming the club's manager that same year.|$|E
25|$|But Busch {{nevertheless}} saw the company's {{purchase of}} the Cardinals as a shrewd business move. It would first increase A–B's sales through the captive market {{of as many as}} 30,000 spectators, many of whom would buy a beer or two, at Sportsman's Park on summer afternoons. Indirectly it <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> the company by disadvantaging one local competitor, Griesedieck Brothers, who had long sponsored the team's radio and television broadcasts, leading one of their brands, Falstaff, to outsell A–B's flagship Budweiser in the city of St. Louis itself, which greatly consterned Busch. At the national level, preventing the Cardinals from moving to Milwaukee would also prevent Schlitz and Pabst, the company's two main competitors at that time, from capitalizing on having a local major-league team to use as a promotional platform and similar captive market for beer sales at games. Lastly, it would be favorable for the company's image to have kept the team in St. Louis.|$|E

Maldini played in all three of Italy's group matches. The 1998 World Cup in France would see Italy start strongly, topping their group. Maldini played in all five of Italy's matches, and started the play that led to Christian Vieri's opening goal in Italy's first match against Chile, which ended in a 2–2 draw. Maldini, partnering with Alessandro Costacurta, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta and Giuseppe Bergomi, <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> Italy to keep clean sheets in the second group match against Cameroon, the round of 16 match Norway and France in the quarter-finals, but Italy would eventually {{go out of the}} tournament to the hosts and eventual champions on penalties, for the third consecutive time in a World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{reflected}} public opinion, which {{resonated with}} the ideological argument that communism flourishes in poverty. Truman's own prestige and power had been greatly enhanced by his stunning {{victory in the}} 1948 election. Across America, multiple interest groups, including business, labor, farming, philanthropy, ethnic groups, and religious groups, saw the Marshall Plan as an inexpensive solution to a massive problem, noting it <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> American exports and stimulate the American economy as well. Major newspapers were highly supportive, including such conservative outlets as Time Magazine. Vandenberg made sure of bipartisan support on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Solid Democratic South was highly supportive, the upper Midwest was dubious, but heavily outnumbered. The plan was opposed by conservatives in the rural Midwest, who opposed any major government spending program and were highly suspicious of Europeans. The plan also had some opponents on the left, led by Henry A. Wallace, the former Vice President. He said the Plan was hostile to the Soviet Union, a subsidy for American exporters, and sure to polarize the world between East and West. However, opposition against the Marshall Plan was greatly reduced by {{the shock of the}} Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. The appointment of the prominent businessman Paul G. Hoffman as director reassured conservative businessmen that the gigantic sums of money would be handled efficiently.|$|E
25|$|John R. Dunning, {{professor}} of physics at Columbia, closely followed the work of Ernest Lawrence on the cyclotron. Dunning wanted a more powerful neutron source and the cyclotron appeared as an attractive tool to achieve this end. During 1935 and 1936, he was able to construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts to reduce costs and funding from industrial and private donations. The cyclotron design and building project began as Anderson was completing his engineering degree. At the suggestion of Professor Dana Mitchell, Dunning offered Anderson a teaching assistant position if he <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> with the design and building of the cyclotron. While working on his doctorate, Anderson made two major contributions to the project. The first was to design a high frequency filament supply, rather than the commonly used direct current version. This fostered longer filament life in the high magnetic field environment of a cyclotron. The second and more important contribution was the use of a pair of concentric lines to feed the cyclotron dees (cyclotron electrodes {{in the shape of a}} “D”), rather than the usual induction system. This refinement resulted in greater cyclotron efficiency and thereafter became a regular feature in cyclotron design. Others assisting Anderson in the construction of the cyclotron were Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, Hugh Glassford, and, of course, professor Dunning. In anticipation of conducting experiments with the cyclotron, Anderson also built an ionization chamber and a linear amplifier in late 1938.|$|E
5|$|After the {{suspicious}} {{death of his}} wife Drogo fled England, and the castle was reassigned by William the Conqueror to Odo, the Count of Aumale. In 1096 it passed to Arnulf de Montgomery, but returned to the Aumales in 1102, who held it until 1221. Trade initially flourished and as a result William le Gros founded the fortified town of Skipsea Brough along the ridgeway just south of the castle, probably around 1160. The town was intended to bring in valuable revenue to the earls, but <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> to defend the castle on its most vulnerable, overlooked side.

40|$|AbstractThis paper appraises {{the likely}} {{effects of the}} Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the East African Community (EAC) and the European Union (EU). Customs data are used to {{estimate}} the revenue and welfare effects of an EPA with and without an exception list. Revenue and welfare effects are rather small. The paper then discusses the benefits that would have occurred had the EAC-EU protocol on rules of origin been simplified and made more compatible with the multilateral trading system. An inclusion of services <b>would</b> have <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> achieve the objective of increased competitiveness in goods trade, while the time table for tariff reduction in the EAC should have been shorter. The paper suggests in closing that the present appraisal is applicable also to the other African EPAs...|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Elasmosaurus and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the head slowly up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were located {{at the top of}} the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This stereoscopic vision would help it find small prey. Hunting from below <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> by silhouetting the prey in the sunlight while concealing Elasmosaurus in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small bony fish and marine invertebrates, as their small, non-kinetic skulls would have limited the prey they could eat. The long, slender teeth were adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, and hence it was swallowed whole. It swallowed small stones to aid its digestion.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the ways}} that Biko and the BCM sought to achieve {{psychological}} empowerment was through community development. Community projects were seen not only as a way to alleviate poverty in black communities but also as a means of transforming society psychologically, culturally, and economically. They <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> students to learn about the [...] "daily struggles" [...] of ordinary black people and to spread Black Consciousness ideas among the population. Among the projects that SASO set its members to conduct in the holidays were repairs to schools, house-building, and instructions on financial management and agricultural techniques.
