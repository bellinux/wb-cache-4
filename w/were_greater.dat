5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the mass density of the universe <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{quantities}} of hydrocarbons <b>were</b> <b>greater.</b> According to one source, {{in the period}} from 1751 to 2008 about 347 gigatonnes of carbon were released as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels. Another source puts the amount added to the atmosphere for the period since 1750 at 879 Gt, and the total going to the atmosphere, sea, and land (such as peat bogs) at almost 2,000 Gt.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment {{resulting}} from the Great Depression caused unrest. The industrial growth spurt of the 1930s gradually slowed. The economic conditions of the 1930s contributed {{to the process of}} internal migration from the countryside and smaller towns to the cities, especially Buenos Aires, where there <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> opportunities for employment. The urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections. Traditional export agriculture stagnated at the outbreak of World War II and remained sluggish.|$|E

5|$|After several {{damaging}} air attacks, {{the naval}} surface combatants from both America and Japan {{withdrew from the}} battle area without either side securing a clear victory. However, the U.S. and its allies gained tactical and strategic advantage. Japan's losses <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies more {{time to prepare for}} the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> during longer work shifts.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{turned the}} ball over twice—once on a fumble and once on an interception. The two {{turnovers}} resulted in twotouchdowns for Florida State, and the resulting 14 points <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than Florida State's margin of victory. The Seminoles did not turn {{the ball over}} during the game. Both teams were highly penalized during the game. Virginia Tech finished with 17penalties for 143yards, while Florida State was penalized 12times for 114yards. The penalties affected each team's ability to convert third downs, as Virginia Tech was only able to convert 9of 20third-down attempts, while Florida State was successful on just 3of its 13attempts. Despite trailing {{for much of the}} game and running a pass-heavy offense, Virginia Tech dominated the game's time of possession, controlling the ball for over 35of the game's 60minutes.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{returned}} to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen {{to win a}} place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, {{but at the same time}} suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled {{in the city of}} Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim {{to take control of the}} synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land <b>were</b> <b>greater.</b>|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{was a major}} unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe {{before the}} Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered {{maritime}} connections between those areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the Church had widened {{to the extent that}} the cultural and religious differences <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than the similarities. The formal break, known as the East–West Schism, came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two Churches—the Western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern branch the Eastern Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|On 7 November 1943, Berryman became acting {{commander}} of II Corps, a post which became permanent on 20 January 1944, superseding Vasey, whose 7th Division was diplomatically placed directly under Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead's New Guinea Force. II Corps {{was left with}} the 5th and 9th Divisions. Berryman was promoted to lieutenant general on 20 January 1944. As in Syria, Berryman proved a hard-driving commander. In December 1943, II Corps broke out of the position around Finschhafen and began a pursuit along the coast. Whenever the Japanese Army attempted to make a stand, Berryman attacked with 25-pounder artillery barrages and Matilda tanks. Berryman was aware that seasonal changes were making the surf rougher and making it ever harder to operate the US Army landing craft (LCMs) and Australian Army amphibious trucks (DUKWs) that he depended on for the logistical support of his troops, but he realised that the Japanese Army's supply difficulties <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than his own, and he gambled that if he pushed hard enough the Japanese {{would be unable to}} regroup and organise a successful defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Nanking had been quicker and easier than the Japanese had foreseen; they lost only 1,953 {{soldiers}} in battle, plus 4,994 wounded. Japan's casualties were undoubtedly dwarfed {{by those of}} China, though no precise figures exist on how many Chinese were killed in action. The Japanese claimed to have killed up to 84,000 enemies during the Nanking campaign whereas a contemporary Chinese source claimed that their army suffered 20,000 casualties. Masahiro Yamamoto noted that the Japanese usually inflated their opponent's body counts while the Chinese had reason to downplay the scale of their loss. Ikuhiko Hata estimates that 50,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in combat during the entire battle whereas Jay Taylor puts the number at 70,000 and states that proportionate {{to the size of}} the force committed, such losses <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than those suffered in the devastating Battle of Shanghai. On the other hand, Chinese scholar Sun Zhaiwei estimates Chinese combat losses at 6,000 to 10,000 men.|$|E
