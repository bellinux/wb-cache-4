It describes the overview of the wind resources in all the WFs and presents an Unified Cooperation Wake Model (UCWM) and Coordination and Optimization Control (CnOC) for WFs. Based on WP assessment of WFs, the statistical method is used to model the distribution of wind speed and Wind Direction (WD). Some simulation figures about the wind rose andWeibull distribution demonstrate the detailed description and assessment of WP. These assessments are expected to enhance the effectiveness of WP exploitation and utilization in WFs of Luxembourg...|$|R

A bottom mounted type wind turbine will be installed relatively close to shore in Japan and sometimes close to dense marine traffic area. Consideration of the risk will be necessary in planning a <b>WF.</b> This <b>paper</b> presented an estimation of a damage caused by collision with a drifting ship accidentally entered a wind farm. The WF is assumed comprised of bottom mounted type offshore wind turbines. The size of the drift ship considered in the analysis is 6788 GT.

After a brief survey of the distribution of discourse markers in <b>WF,</b> the <b>paper</b> proposes a syntactic analysis of the discourse markers ne and we. Based on the distribution of these discourse markers, of vocatives and of dislocated DPs, an articulated speech act layer is elaborated which corroborates the proposals in Hill (). It is postulated that there is a syntactic relation between particles used as discourse markers and vocatives. The paper offers further support for the grammaticalization of pragmatic features at the interface between syntax and discourse and for the hypothesis that the relevant computation at the interface is of the same nature as that in Narrow Syntax...|$|R
40|$|Expanded {{integration}} of wind energy implies technical confronts to maintain system reliability. Thus, comprehensive reliability models for wind turbines and related features are required. Composite and precise wind farms (WFs) reliability analysis includes {{wind turbine generator}} (WTG) detailed models besides wind speed (WS) probabilistic variations considering wake effects. This paper is considered as an extension to the proposed multi-state duration sampling model to asses WTG reliability integrated with a comprehensive representation for <b>WF.</b> The <b>paper</b> investigates the impacts of two WTG frequency support operation algorithms on capacity factors and first hierarchical level indices. LOEE is evaluated using a novel method to emphasis the chronological coordination between load and WS attitudes. System and load pointsâ€™ reliability indices are estimated at moderate penetration levels of wind energy using a simplified technique. Results insure the feasibility of the composite WTG reliability model and provide reasonable indicators for WFs integration influence...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{photovoltage}} of semiconductors depend strongly {{on their}} electronic structures, in particular, their Fermi energy level. This offers a possibility to characterize photoelectronic behavior using the Kelvin probe structure by measurements of work function (<b>WF).</b> In this <b>paper,</b> ZnO films were prepared using the CVD method and their microstructures and morphology were characterized using the XRD and SEM. Furthermore, photovoltage evolution and WF of selected ZnO samples were measured using a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) system. It is {{found that the}} surface photovoltage and its time-resolved evolution process {{as well as the}} energy level structure of ZnO films can be correlated to WF very well. The present study therefore provides a simple and practical methodology for the characterization of photovoltaic behavior of semiconductor films. Photovoltaic, films...|$|R

40|$|Process-oriented {{support of}} {{collaborative}} work {{is an important}} challenge today. At first glance, Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) {{seem to be very}} suitable tools for realizing team-work processes. However, such processes have to be frequently adapted, e. g., due to process optimizations or when process goals change. Unfortunately, runtime adaptability still seems to be an unsolvable problem for almost all existing WfMS. Usually, process changes can be accomplished by modifying a corresponding (graphical) workflow (WF) schema. Es-pecially for long-running processes, however, it is extremely important that such changes can be propagated to already running WF instances as well, but without causing inconsis-tencies and errors. In addition, team work often requires ad-hoc process modifications, i. e., individual changes of single <b>WF</b> instances. The <b>paper</b> presents a general and comprehensive correctness criterion for ensuring compliance of in-progress WF instances with a modified WF schema. For different kinds of WF schema changes, it is precisely stated, which rules and which information are needed at mininum for satisfying this criterion. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{believe that}} {{workflow}} services {{can be implemented}} using the OHS approach and such an open hypermedia based workflow service will be more flexible to fit into dynamic work situations than other approaches to provide WF functionality. The on-going OHS work on a component-based architecture and an extensible open hypermedia data model provides a foundation for developing such hypermedia based <b>WF</b> services. This <b>paper</b> raises and discusses issues on the implementation of open hypermedia based workflow services. Answers {{to some of the}} issues are suggested, while still many are to be discussed in the workshop or just left as feedback to the CB-OHS community. Introduction In our work on the CHIPS system [4, 5, 6], we have developed a hypermedia based process meta-model and a method to incorporate process-related semantics into hypermedia structures. In such a process model, tasks are represented by task nodes; Control and data flow connectors between tasks are represented by process links [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The water {{footprint}} (WF) is an indicator {{that accounts for}} both the direct (domestic water use) and indirect (water required to produce industrial and agricultural products) water use of a consumer or producer. This paper makes a review on the WF indicator and its applicability for EU 28 (EU 27 and Croatia) policy. More particularly the volumetric WF assessment approach of the Water Footprint Network (WFN) is reviewed. A synthesis of existing national WF accounting quantities results in an EU 28 WF of production (WFprod) of 3420 lcd (609 km 3 /yr) and a WF of consumption (WFcons) of 4815 lcd (857 km 3 /yr). Of the latter 60 % is internal and 40 % is external to Europe. The EU 28 is a net virtual water importer. The WF of agricultural products contributes {{by far the largest}} fraction of the total WF, i. e. 91 % of the total WFprod and 89 % of the WFcons. With traditional water use statistics, awareness campaigns and policy have always focused on increasing water efficiency in domestic and industrial water use. However, much more water can be saved in agricultural production processes, by reducing food waste and by a change in diet of the average EU consumer. Together with a comprehensive overview on possible ways to reduce <b>WF,</b> this <b>paper</b> provides a critical review on the WF methodology, showing that the development of the WF concept is still not complete. Practical complexities with data (availability of and inconsistencies in the underlying databases) are a concern. Some conceptual aspects need to be further developed and tested, not at least the indicators for sustainability assessment. The most important limitation {{is the fact that it}} is a partial tool to be used in combination with other analytical means or indicators when determining integrated policy options. Nevertheless, its main strength is the possibility to show the importance of consumption patterns and global dimensions in water governance. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flexible {{support of}} {{distributed}} business processes is a charac-teristic challenge for any workflow management system (WfMS). Scalability at {{the presence of}} high loads {{as well as the}} capability to dynamically adapt running process instances are essential requirements. Should the latter one be not met, the WfMS will not have the neces-sary flexibility to cover the wide range of process-oriented applications deployed in many organizations. Scalability and flexibility have, for the most part, been treated separately in literature thus far. Even though they are basic needs for a WfMS, the requirements related with them are totally different. To achieve satisfactory scalability, on the one hand the system needs to be designed such that a workflow (WF) instance can be controlled by several WF servers that are as independent from each other as possible. Yet dynamic WF changes, on the other hand, neces-sitate a (logical) central control instance which knows the current and global state of a <b>WF</b> instance. This <b>paper</b> presents methods which allow ad-hoc modifications (e. g., to insert, delete, or shift steps) to be correctly performed in a distributed WfMS; i. e., in a WfMS with partitioned WF execution graphs and distributed WF control. It is especially noteworthy that the system succeeds in realizing the full functionality as given in the central case while, at the same time, achieving favorable behavior with respect to communication costs. ...|$|R
