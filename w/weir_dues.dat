40|$|Abstract- Weirs have widely {{been used}} for the flow measurement, flow {{diversion}} and its control in the open channels. Generally they are used as normal weirs of various shapes like rectangular, triangular, trapezoidal, etc. pose problems of submergence upstream of the <b>weir</b> <b>due</b> to large afflux required to pass the discharge downstream. Several weirs of modified plan form like oblique weirs, diagonal weirs, Duckwill weirs, Labyrinth weirs etc. have successfully been used to control the afflux and to enhance their discharging capacity with minimum head over the weirs. Labyrinth weirs are folded in the plan view (i. e. the weir crest is not straight in plan form) to provide a longer crest length compared to a normal weir having the same lateral space to increase the discharge for a given operating head. For large reservoirs, the labyrinth weir is used as the overflow structure.

40|$|Recurrent flood events {{induced by}} typhoons are {{powerful}} agents to modify channel morphology in Taiwan’s rivers. Frequent channel migrations reflect highly sensitive valley floors {{and increase the}} risk to infrastructure and residents along rivers. Therefore, monitoring channel planforms is essential for analyzing channel stability as well as improving river management. This study analyzed annual channel changes along two sediment-rich rivers, the Zhuoshui River and the Gaoping River, from 2008 to 2015 based on satellite images of FORMOSAT- 2. Channel areas were digitized from mid-catchment to river mouth (~ 90 km). Channel stability for reaches was assessed through analyzing the changes of river indices including braid index, active channel width, and channel activity. In general, the valley width {{plays a key role}} in braided degree, active channel width, and channel activity. These indices increase as the valley width expands whereas the braid index decreases slightly close to the river mouth due to the change of river types. This downstream pattern in the Zhuoshui River was interrupted by hydraulic construction which resulted in limited changes downstream from the <b>weir,</b> <b>due</b> to the lack of water and sediment supply. A 200 -year flood, Typhoon Morakot in 2009, induced significant changes in the two rivers. The highly active landscape in Taiwan results in very sensitive channels compared to other regions. An integrated Sensitivity Index was proposed for identifying unstable reaches, which could be a useful reference for river authorities when making priorities in river regulation strategy. This study shows that satellite image monitoring coupled with river indices analysis could be an effective tool to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in channel stability in highly dynamic river systems...|$|R
40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture launched an ambitious program for constructing small hillside reservoirs in the northern and-central region of the country. At present, more than 720 reservoirs have been created. They consist of small compacted earth dams supplied with a, horizontal overflow <b>weir.</b> <b>Due</b> to lack of hydrological data and the area's extreme floods, however, {{it is very difficult to}} design the overflow weirs. Also, catchments are very sensitive to erosion and the reservoirs are rapidly silted up. Consequently, prediction of flood volumes for important rainfall events becomes crucial. Few hydrological observations, however, exist for the catchment areas. For this purpose a geomorphological model methodology is presented to predict shape and volume of hydrographs for important floods. This model is built around a production function that defines the net storm rainfall (portion of rainfall during a storm which reaches a stream channel as direct runoff) from the total rainfall (observed rainfall in the catchment) and a transfer function based on the most complete possible definition of the surface drainage system. Observed rainfall during 5 -min time steps was used in the model. The model runoff generation is based on surface drainage characteristics which can be easily extracted from maps. The model was applied to two representative experimental catchments in central Tunisia. The conceptual rainfall-runoff model based on surface topography and drainage. network was seen to reproduce observed runoff satisfactory. The calibrated model was used to estimate runoff from 5, 10, 20, and 50 year rainfall return periods regarding runoff volume, maximum runoff, as well as the general shape of the runoff hydrograph. Practical conclusions to design hill reservoirs and to extrapolate results using this model methodology for ungauged small catchments in semiarid Tunisia are made. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

After the 10, 000 m 3 ERIKA Spill in France, less than 5 % was recovered before the oil reached the coast. The weather played an important role, but the selection of equipment and apparent response strategy did as well. Mainly weir skimmers were used. <b>Weir</b> skimmers are <b>due</b> to their simplicity and reliability widely used in spills at sea. Probably because some of the well known brands are equipped with heavy oil transfer pumps, they are even commonly attempted used in heavy oil spills. But also high capacity units with light oil centrifugal transfer pumps are being used on heavy oil (ERIKA). However, weir skimmers start losing their efficiency when the viscosity of the oil exceeds certain limits. It gets too difficult for the oil to pass the weir lip and flow into the hopper, so that the pump can transfer it. For very heavy oils, which barely can float, the inlet weir becomes an even larger obstruction.

The mechanical feeder principle may result in significantly increased performance regarding high viscosity, debris, and- i...|$|R
40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of dams often requires spillway capacity upgrades. Replacing a less hydraulically efficient linear weir with a labyrinth weir {{can be an}} effective way to increase discharge efficiency (discharge at a given upstream head) for a fixed-width channel. Labyrinth weirs are linear weirs folded in plan view to increase total spillway crest length (which in turn increases discharge efficiency within a channel). Labyrinth weirs potentially have limitless geometric configurations. This study was performed to analyze the effects of varying certain geometric parameters on discharge efficiency and design method predictions. Due to limited cross-sectional flow area near the upstream apex, labyrinth weirs experience nappe collision and local submergence that potentially reduce discharge efficiency. The increase of upstream apex width may be a feasible method to decrease the negative effects of nappe interference, which in turn may increase discharge efficiency. This was analyzed in this study by testing a series of eight laboratory scaled labyrinth weirs (with sidewall angles of 12 °), with various upstream apex widths. Upstream apex width tests were performed in a fixed and varied channel width setting. The design method developed by Crookston and Tullis is based on laboratory scaled physical models. This method is very useful in the estimation of performance for geometrically similar prototype labyrinth <b>weirs.</b> However, <b>due</b> to difficulty in obtaining data on completed prototype weirs, design method predictions are rarely verified. To help validate Froude scaling and design method predictions of prototype weirs, a series of physical model tests (with sidewall angles of 15 °) were performed with varying scale sizes (0. 5 to 3. 0 compared to the size of weir used in the design method). To expand the applicability of the design method to common geometric variations, tests were performed on weirs of varying weir height and cycle width (with sidewall angles of 15 °). These variations were applied independently and analyzed to determine their effects on discharge efficiency and design method predictions. A correction factor is then presented to be used in conjunction with Crookston and Tullis’s design method for these geometric variations. All conclusions are presented in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The Meuse in the Netherlands is {{since the}} 1920 s dammed by 7 weirs, which are located near Borgharen, Linne, Roermond, Belfeld, Sambeek, Grave and Lith. The weirs {{regulate}} the water {{levels in the}} canal sections (=stuwpanden) to provide sufficient depth for navigation. The management of the weirs is regulated by water level measurements at Maastricht St. Pieter (formerly Borgharen). The weirs dam the river for discharges lower than 1200 m 3 /s. For higher discharges the weirs are completely opened. Weir Linne is the oldest weir of the canalized Meuse and {{is part of the}} smallest canal section (=kanaalpand) of the Meuse. The weir consists just like the weirs of Roermond, Belfeld and Sambeek of two parts, a rough discharge regulating Poirée part and a accurate regulating Stoney part. Weir Linne maintains a water level of 20. 80 m +NAP in the upper canal section. The canal section forms a navigable interchange between the Juliana Kanaal, Lateraal Kanaal, Kanaal Wessem-Nederweert and canal section Roermond. The weirs in the Dutch part of the Meuse have been constructed for a period between 80 and 100 years. The weirs are approaching the end of their lifetime in the period between 2020 and 2030. In this situation is not spoken about design lifetime because in the period when the weirs were constructed the design lifetime was not defined. Based on maintenance reports and inspections it is concluded that the weirs are not able to fulfill their functions properly, they need to be replaced or upgraded. The main reasons for replacement or upgrading are technical and functional aging and changing legislations. According to Rijkswaterstaat the weir of Linne has ended its lifespan in the year 2030. Aging of materials and changes in the ARBO legislations are issues of the weir. This conclusions is the result of inspections and analyzes over several years. Besides aging of materials also aging in functionality contributes to the decrease of the weir quality. The functionality of the weirs has been changed in time due to changing conditions, in the RINK project called "new risks". These functional changes can have their causes in changes of design assumptions, maintenance, usability and controllability or law and regulations. The weir of Linne has to deal with the risks of changing discharges, ASR degradation, operability and the weir does not meet the ARBO regulations. This graduation report is focused on the problems of weir of Linne. The aim of this thesis research is to improve the situation of weir Linne for the future situation by replacing of upgrading the weir. The weir should meet the requirements based on discharge and navigational purposes in the future. This report is made up at four scale levels, the problem is approached from a high scale level to lower scale levels. The levels are made up according to the elementary design cycle. The first scale level concerns the canalized Meuse in the Netherlands. Because canal section Linne is relatively small It is investigated if it is possible to remove weir Linne instead of renewing or upgrading of the weir. The second scale level focuses on canal section Linne. In this section the effect of the Maasplassen with respect to the water level changes of the canal section is investigated for high and low discharges. Also the effect of the water level changes to the weir management is investigated to obtain a clear view about the reaction time of weir operations with regard to opening and closure of the weir. The third design level concerns the construction of weir Linne. It is considered if according to the RINK reports the current weir construction should be renewed or upgraded. The chapter proceeds with a rough analysis about the required width and retaining height of the weir to obtain if the discharge capacity of the current weir is sufficient for the future. It is decided to upgrade the Poirée part of the weir, the last part of this design level concerns the determination of a new gate type for the Poirée part of the weir. The lowest design level is focusing on the design of the new weir gate. The gate is designed in high strength concrete. The dimensions of the gate elements are determined and the gate is checked to the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The last section of the lowest design level concerns the way of placing and connecting the new gate to the current construction. The result of the first design level is that abolishing canal section Linne by combining the canal section with the upstream or downstream canal sections is not advisable. Weir and weir section Linne should be maintained in the future. This hold also for the other canal sections of the Meuse corridor except for canal section Lith. Because this canal section is the most downstream section in the Meuse canalization and far away from Linne, interventions to this canal section would have no effect on weir and canal section Linne. However the result holds for the current layout of the Meuse corridor. If a new layout should be proposed for the canalization of the Meuse it should be analyzed if weir Linne should be maintained or removed. The Maasplassen have a damping effect on the water level changes in canal section Linne. The damping effect is the effect of the relation between the changing discharge with respect to the water level changes in the canal section. Due to the Maasplassen the water level changes develop more slowly compared to a situation without the Maasplassen. This {{is the result of the}} storage capacity of the Maasplassen. The damping effect of the Maasplassen is most preferable and effective during low discharges. Navigational dept is maintained for a longer period because the water level decrease proceeds slowly due to the connected lakes. The discharge accuracy of the weir is not sufficient for the small discharges in the future, to maintain the navigable depth during low discharges the discharge accuracy should be increased. The damping has less effect on extreme high discharges compared to low discharges. Because the canal section is relatively small the water level rise will be relatively quick regardless of the damping effect of the Maasplassen. An increase of the storage capacity of the Maasplassen has a minor influence on this effect. However, the banks and retention areas are omitted in the analysis of the effects of the Maasplassen to the water level changes in canal section Linne. The results are not exact however, relative to each other the variants do represent a clear view about the effect of the Maasplassen to the water level changes. The opening procedure shorter than 8 hours is reliable after high discharges are measured at measure point Maastricht St. Pieter. Investigations on running times of flood waves on the Meuse have been done are not valid any more. Due to the Grensmaasproject running times for food waves will change. It is not advisable according to the RINK (=Risico Inventarisatie Natte Kunstwerken) report to replace the total weir of Linne at the moment. It is advised to monitor the condition of the weir until the period 2030 - 2035 and to take after this period a final decision. After this period a decision should be made to replace the or maintain the current weir for a longer period. In this report is concluded to maintain the current weir construction instead constructing a new <b>weir.</b> <b>Due</b> to over dimensioning the concrete super construction is a robust construction. The upgrade of the current weir will be done by the removal of the Poirée gates and constructing a new gate on the old Poirée part. The Poirée gate does not meet the requirements according to the ARBO legislations and the gate is not able to be remote controlled. The new type of weir that is chose to replace the old Poirée gates is the inflatable flap gate. The flap gate is able to retain a the required water level, able to close the old Poirée part without large reconstruction of the weir. The gate fulfills (when properly designed) the ARBO legislations and is able to be remote controlled. The flap gate is designed in concrete class C 90 / 105, this is a high strength concrete. High strength concrete is a durable construction material and requires less maintenance compared to steel constructions, especially in wet environments. The gate will be supported three air filled bladders, the bladders are placed next to each other. The concrete construction meets the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The checks of reinforcement, cracks and moment of failure are done for bending moments and shear resulting of loads perpendicular to the gate. Torsion due to for example failure of bladders is not taken into account. Checks to the concrete gate with regard to moments, cracks and failure due to torsion moments are also not taken into account. The gate will be placed as a prefabricated element. The element contains the gate, bladder, chain and supporting bottom plate. The plate is on upstream side placed at the rotation notches of the former Poirée gates and on the downstream side to the weir bottom. The gate could be further optimized, optimization could be done by for example reducing of the gate weight and curving the gate to increase the discharge capacity.

40|$|The {{poor quality}} of many {{receiving}} waters has {{been attributed to}} the frequent operation of combined sewer overflows (C. S. O. s). As the existing need for overflow structures is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future it is imperative that these deleterious effects are minimised. The present study investigates the pollution performance of three common overflow structure designs (the stilling pond, the double high side weir and the double low side weir) and aims to institute a novel pollution monitoring methodology for combined sewer overflows. Four sites in the central Sheffield area were monitored for periods from 9 to 13 months (two high-side weirs, one low-side weir and a stilling pond). Each overflow was monitored with continuous flow measurement equipment and bottle samplers to obtain samples of sewage from the storm and dry weather flows. The bottle samples were analysed for suspended solids (SS), ash, BOD, COD, pH, conductivity and ammonia. Mesh bags and frames were also installed to trap the gross solids (solids with a median size> 6 mm) from the inflow and the spill flow. The stilling pond and the high side weirs were found to perform well hydraulically, limiting the flow to treatment to a steady maximum. The low side weir performed unsatisfactorily, hydraulically, as the flow to treatment rose as the incoming flow increased and, for some storm conditions, a hydraulic jump formed towards the downstream end of the chamber. The first foul flush was regularly observed at the stilling pond and low side weir sites. Peak concentrations for SS were found to be 600 times greater than the dry weather flow for the same time of day. The first foul flush was rarely observed at the other sites. For the majority of storms at each site the spill concentrations were of a similar magnitude to the inflow sample concentrations. However for a large minority of SS, BOD and COD samples, the concentrations of the spill samples were significantly less than the inflow samples. t-Tests suggested that at the stilling pond and high side weir sites there is a significant reduction in the spill sample concentrations for the water quality (bottle) samples. Although the load of material spilled during an overflow event was found to be small in comparison to the inflow load, large amounts of material were spilled to the watercourse during storm events at each of the sites investigated. The storm load entering the CSO was found to be considerably influenced by peak intensity of the storm at the stilling pond site and antecedent dry weather period at one of the high side weir sites. At the other sites a number of hydrological factors were found to be influential e. g. duration. It is thought that time of year may also be important factor as this influences the type of rainfall (its duration and intensity). The types of gross solid collected at each site were similar with leaf material and sanitary towels consistently being the major items in terms of total mass. The efficiency of the stilling pond and one of the high side weirs in retaining gross solids in the flow to treatment appeared to be explained by the flow split although for 5 of 14 storms at the stilling pond and 3 of 7 at the high side weir a treatment effect was observed. The treatment factors at the low side weir were noticeably less than those for the other three sites with all being less than unity (average 0. 5). This suggests that the low side weir preferentially discharges gross solid material over the weir. The treatment factors at the other high side <b>weir</b> were low <b>due</b> to inadequate sampling of the spill flow. </p...|$|R
