5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot {{injury in the}} Broncos Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the scene of a fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> woman. The Broncos denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a bystander.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

25|$|The former Water Ministry made {{an effort}} to draft a Water Law {{integrating}} the multipurpose use of <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> coherent and unique legal document. It is uncertain whether the new Environment and Water Resources Ministry will continue with this effort. In the meantime, two of the most important sectors in terms of social effect are regulated under a specific law, namely the Water and Sanitation Services Law No. 2066 and the Irrigation Law No. 7828.|$|E
25|$|Uruguay is {{the only}} country in Latin America that has {{achieved}} quasi universal coverage of access to safe drinking water supply and adequate sanitation. Water service quality is considered good, with practically all localities in Uruguay receiving disinfected <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> continuous basis. 70% of wastewater collected by the national utility was treated. Given these achievements, the government's priority is to improve the efficiency of services and to expand access to sewerage, where appropriate, in areas where on-site sanitation is used.|$|E

The hull has largely disintegrated with only the vessel's floors and the stern section recognisable. Plating, frames and stringers are strewn throughout the wreckage with one deck winch and sections of windlass the only machinery apparent.|$|E

25|$|Hurricanes pose {{a severe}} threat each {{year during the}} June 1 to November 30 {{hurricane}} season, particularly from August to October. Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with subtropical or tropical <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lengthy coastline. Of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck the United States, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas. From 1851 to 2006, Florida was struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 3 and above. It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm.|$|E
25|$|The double trap siphonic toilet is a {{less common}} type that is {{exceptionally}} quiet when flushed. There is a device known as an aspirator which uses the flow of <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flush to suck air from the cavity between the two traps, reducing the air pressure there to create the siphon which sucks water and waste from the toilet bowl. Towards {{the end of the}} flush the aspirator ceases being covered in water, thus allowing air into the cavity between traps to break the siphon without the noise while the final flush water fills the pan.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} a sail or balloon tip {{modification}} of Ronald Bradley's simple portex tubing method came about from Swan's observation from the Laguna Beach CA shore of sail boats on the <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> relatively calm day. Boats with conventional slot sails were still; one with a spinnaker {{was able to make}} reasonable headway. The concept of using thermodilution to measure cardiac output was originally the idea of Arnost Fronek. As a former colleague of Fronek, Ganz added the thermistor modification after Swan showed him the initial balloon design, which was fabricated by Edwards Laboratories, which had previously contracted with Swan as a consultant.|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{experiments on}} animals {{can be set}} up differently than those on humans. The “flower pot” method involves placing a laboratory animal above <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> platform so small that it falls off upon losing muscle tone. The naturally rude awakening which results may elicit changes in the organism which necessarily exceed the simple absence of a sleep phase. This method also stops working after about 3 days as the subjects (typically rats) lose their will to avoid the water. Another method involves computer monitoring of brain waves, complete with automatic mechanized shaking of the cage when the test animal drifts into REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|Hurricanes pose {{a severe}} threat during {{hurricane}} season, which lasts from June 1 to November 30, although some storms {{have been known}} to form out of season. Florida is the most hurricane-prone US state, with subtropical or tropical <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lengthy coastline. From 1851 to 2006, Florida has been struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 3 and above. It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm. For storms, category 4 or higher, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas. August to October is the most likely period for a hurricane in Florida.|$|E
25|$|The second {{report was}} shorter. It {{recommended}} that Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski should {{move to the}} U.S. where there were plans to make heavy <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large scale. Plutonium might be more suitable than uranium-235, and plutonium research should continue in Britain. It concluded that the controlled fission of uranium {{could be used to}} generate heat energy for use in machines, and provide large quantities of radioisotopes which could be used as substitutes for radium. Heavy water or possibly graphite might serve as moderator for the fast neutrons. In conclusion though, while the nuclear reactor had considerable promise for future peaceful uses, the committee felt that it was not worth considering during the present war.|$|E
