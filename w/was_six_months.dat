Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there.

5|$|Nevill and June adopted Bamber when he <b>was</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> old. They {{sent him}} to St Nicholas Primary and the private Maldon Court prep school, along with Sheila, {{followed}} by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, which he attended from September 1970. He was miserable there, not least because of bullying and a sexual assault. He left Gresham's with no qualifications, but attended sixth-form college and in 1978 passed seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where Bamber took a scuba-diving course, then New Zealand.

5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase <b>was</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> late.|$|E

5|$|When Davidson {{returned}} home {{he found that}} Molly <b>was</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent {{that he was not}} the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory {{in the latter part of}} 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at Simla in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early on Monday morning and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and sometimes he would fail to arrive at all.|$|E
