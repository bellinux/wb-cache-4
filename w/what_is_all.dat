2500|$|The {{term was}} first used in English by a {{translation}} of Raphson's work in 1702. It was later used and popularized by Irish writer John Toland in his work of 1705 Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist. Toland was influenced by both Spinoza and Bruno, and had read Joseph Raphson's De Spatio Reali, referring to it as [...] "the ingenious Mr. Ralphson's (sic) Book of Real Space". Like Raphson, he used the terms [...] "pantheist" [...] and [...] "Spinozist" [...] interchangeably. In 1720 he wrote the Pantheisticon: or The Form of Celebrating the Socratic-Society in Latin, envisioning a pantheist society that believed, [...] "All {{things in the world}} are one, and one is all in all things ... <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> in all things is God, eternal and immense, neither born nor ever to perish." [...] He clarified his idea of pantheism in a letter to Gottfried Leibniz in 1710 when he referred to [...] "the pantheistic opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Portland Monthly on December 18, 2012, Franzen revealed that he currently had [...] "a four-page, single-spaced proposal" [...] for a fifth novel he was currently working on, although {{he went on to}} suggest that while he had a proposal there was no guarantee that what was proposed would make the final cut, saying of similar proposals for previous novels, [...] "I look at the old proposals now, and I see the one part of them that actually got made into a book, and I think, 'How come I couldn't see that? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> this other stuff?'". Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding [...] "I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me." [...] In October 2014, during a discussion at Colgate University, Franzen read a [...] "self-contained first-person narrative" [...] that is part of a novel that he hopes will be out in the summer of 2015.|$|E
40|$|Interactions between species, {{particularly}} {{where one}} {{is likely to}} be a pathogen of the other, as well as the geographical distribution of species, have been systematically extracted from various web-based, free-access sources, and assembled with the accompanying evidence into a single database. The database attempts to answer questions such as <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> the pathogens of a host, and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> the hosts of a pathogen, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> the countries where a pathogen <b>was</b> found, and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> the pathogens found in a country. Two datasets were extracted from the database, focussing on species interactions and species distribution, based on evidence published between 1950 - 2012. The quality of their evidence was checked and verified against well-known, alternative, datasets of pathogens infecting humans, domestic animals and wild mammals. The presented datasets provide a valuable resource for researchers of infectious diseases of humans and animals, including zoonoses. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

2500|$|Some of Anderson's men {{managed to}} get across the creek and {{momentarily}} threaten Reynolds's position, however he was reinforced by Meade's brigade and two regiments from Morell's division. The three Confederate brigades were driven back with substantial casualties. Arriving {{on the field and}} realizing what was happening, Robert E. Lee hastily summoned Longstreet's and D.H. Hill's divisions. As Lee surveyed the futile attacks, Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet rode up to him. Davis asked him [...] "General, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> this army and what is it doing here?" [...] Lee replied sarcastically [...] "I don't know, Mr. President. It is not my army and this is no place for it." [...] William D. Pender's brigade then attacked the Union left flank at Ellerson's Mill, held by Seymour's brigade. Once again, the well-entrenched infantry and massed artillery proved too much for the Confederates and Pender was forced to retreat. Just then, Roswell Ripley's brigade of D.H. Hill's division arrived on the field and was ordered next to assault the Union left. Ripley charged head-on into the Union entrenchments and suffered the very worst of all with over 600 casualties, the largest percentage of them coming from the 44th Georgia, which lost 335 men and most of its officers (out of a total of 514), including its colonel Robert A. Smith, a roughly 65% casualty rate. The 1st North Carolina suffered 50% casualties (133 men killed, wounded, or captured) and also lost its commander, Col. Montford Stokes. General Ripley himself survived unscathed, but came within inches of being decapitated by an artillery shell. Ripley's other two regiments, the 3rd North Carolina and 48th Georgia, were {{to the rear of the}} 1st North Carolina and 44th Georgia; their losses were lighter. Union casualties around Ellerson's Mill were small, only 40 men total were killed or wounded in the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves and 12th Pennsylvania Reserves, which were defending this sector of the battlefield. The 13th Pennsylvania Reserves lost 75 men, the highest total number of any Union outfit. Some 20 years after the battle, D.H. Hill wrote [...] "The attacks on the Beaver Dam entrenchments, on the heights of Malvern Hill, at Gettysburg, were all grand, but of exactly the kind of grandeur the South could not afford." ...|$|E
