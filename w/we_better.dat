[...] Edson, speaking to those around him, stated, [...] "I guess <b>we</b> <b>better</b> call them off. They can't seem to cross the river." [...] Puller angrily replied, [...] "You're not going to throw these men away!" [...] apparently in reference to his men trapped {{on the west side of}} the Matanikau, and [...] "stormed" [...] off toward the beach where, with the help of his personal signalman, Puller was able to hail the Navy destroyer [...] that was supporting the operation. Once aboard Monssen, Puller and the destroyer led 10 landing craft towards Point Cruz and established communications with Kelley on the ridge by signal flag.|$|E
500|$|The {{initial set}} release date was late 2004, {{and the band}} had to delay the album to January 2005. But as the new target date was approaching, the band again {{discarded}} songs, which they deemed [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "passionless". Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty-two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions: [...] "We realized that we didn't really have the right songs {{and some of them}} were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record, so we thought <b>we</b> <b>better</b> go back and record them again." [...] Guitarist Jonny Buckland has said that the band had pushed themselves [...] "forward in every direction" [...] in making the album, but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works.|$|E
500|$|For {{their second}} and final album with Arista, Brothers of the Road (1981), they collaborated with a [...] "name producer" [...] (John Ryan, of Styx and the Doobie Brothers), who pushed the band {{even harder to}} change their sound. [...] "Straight from the Heart" [...] was the album's single, which became a minor hit but heralded the group's last {{appearance}} on the top 40 charts. The band, considering their post-reunion albums [...] "embarrassing", subsequently broke up in 1982 after clashing with Clive Davis, who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album, including Tom Dowd and Johnny Sandlin. [...] "We broke up in '82 because we decided <b>we</b> <b>better</b> just back out or we would ruin {{what was left of}} the band’s image," [...] said Betts. The band's final performance came on Saturday Night Live in January 1982, where they performed [...] "Southbound" [...] and [...] "Leavin'." [...] The members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years; in 1986, Betts and Allman toured together, with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set. Allman's solo career began looking up when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987, I'm No Angel. The title track became a surprise hit on radio, garnering heavy airplay.|$|E

500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of my}} voice, 'Hadn't <b>we</b> <b>better</b> get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{made his}} NFL regular season debut on September 6, 1981, in a 24–10 {{loss to the}} Philadelphia Eagles. Aside from {{incurring}} a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington, Taylor played a nondescript game. In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season, Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when {{he was supposed to}} drop into coverage. When told by Parcells that was not what he was assigned to do on that play, and that what he did was not in the playbook, Taylor responded [...] "Well, <b>we</b> <b>better</b> put it in on Monday, because that play's a dandy." [...] He recorded 9.5 sacks in 1981, and his rookie season {{is considered one of the}} best in NFL history. He was named 1981's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, making him [...] the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award. Taylor's arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981. They finished the season 9–7, up five games from the previous season, and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs, where they lost 38–24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned guard John Ayers, the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team's trainer he would be surprised if the linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor's life for $2 million.|$|E

2500|$|He {{also warned}} that Copts who visited Jerusalem would face excommunication {{on the premise}} that there was [...] "no pilgrimage duty in Christianity and it is not a {{religious}} pillar, so since this visit can do harm to our national cause and [...] Muslim and Christian people then <b>we</b> <b>better</b> not visit Jerusalem." [...] He added that Copts should only go to Jerusalem after peace was established in the region. Some of the Coptic property within the compound of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (including the Coptic monastery known as Deir El-Sultan) was delegated to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Upon the application of some bishops, the Coptic Orthodox Holy Synod, based on the direction of Pope Shenouda III, also decided to ask Copts not to visit Jerusalem until the Church possessions and the monastery be returned. In 2006, the Holy Synod renewed the decree, urging Copts not to visit the Christian holy places in Israel, including Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|The phrase was popularised by its usage on the [...] [...] The Second Officer {{suggested}} to Captain Smith, [...] "Hadn't <b>we</b> <b>better</b> get {{the women and}} children into the boats, sir?", to which the captain responded: [...] "put {{the women and children}} in and lower away".

[...] As a consequence, 74% of the women and 52% of the children on board were saved, but only 20% of the men. [...] Some officers on the Titanic misinterpreted the order from Captain Smith, and tried to prevent men from boarding the lifeboats. It was intended that women and children would board first, with any remaining free spaces for men. Because not all women and children were saved on the Titanic, the few men who survived, like White Star official J. Bruce Ismay, were initially branded as cowards.|$|E
