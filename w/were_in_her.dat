5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

25|$|In 1841, Dorothea Dix {{discovered}} that prison conditions <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> opinion, inhumane. Prisoners were chained naked, whipped with rods.

25|$|Scourges next capture {{occurred}} a {{few days}} later, on 21 February. Scourge chased a French privateer for three hours before catching up with her five or six leagues off the coast. The privateer was Furet, pierced for 14 guns. She had 10 mounted; the other four <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hold. She also had a crew of 50 men, as well as 22 English prisoners, seven of whom were wounded. Under the command of Benoish Giron she was 20 days out of Lorient. Glynn described Furet as being coppered and a fast sailer.|$|E

60|$|Now Venice, as she {{was once}} the most religious, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> fall the most corrupt, of European states; and as she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{strength}} {{the centre of the}} pure currents of Christian architecture, so she <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> decline the source of the Renaissance.

25|$|The {{direction}} of the boy's upbringing was entirely {{in the hands of}} his grandmother, the empress Catherine II. As in the case of her eldest grandson (afterwards the emperor Alexander I), she regulated every detail of his physical and mental education; but in accordance with her usual custom, she left the carrying out of her views to the men who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> confidence. Count Nikolai Saltykov {{was supposed to be the}} actual tutor, but he too in his turn transferred the burden to another, interfering personally only on exceptional occasions, and exercised no influence upon the character of the passionate, restless and headstrong boy. The only person who exerted a responsible influence was Cesar La Harpe, who was tutor-in-chief from 1783 to May 1795 and educated both the empress's grandsons.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{she planned}} an escape for the Emperor and her husband. The {{plan was to}} get Colonel Villanueva to escort the Emperor to Veracruz, but Villanueva would not {{go through with it}} without the {{cooperation}} of Colonel Palacios. A bribe was in order. Agnes had offered two promissory notes for 100,000 pesos to each of them which would be honored by Maximilian's brother, Franz Joseph. While they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> parlor Agnes revealed the plan to Palacios, who had told her earlier that he sympathized with the Emperor. Palacios was skeptical and said he would give her his answer in the morning. Agnes agreed, believing he would go through with it. Maximilian was executed 19 June 1867 in Santiago de Querétaro.|$|E
25|$|Altering the murderer's motives. In the novel, Lady Westholme murdered Mrs Boynton to {{keep her}} past secret. Before {{climbing}} the social ladder, she was incarcerated in the same prison where Mrs Boynton had been a warden. Knowing Mrs Boynton's sadistic personality, she silenced her {{to keep her}} reputation and her social status. In the adaptation, Dame Celia Westholme served as a maid {{in the home of}} Lady Boynton (who was then Mrs Pierce) before becoming a writer. She had an affair with Dr Gerard, delivered a child, and was sent away to a nunnery in Ireland while Lady Boynton kept the baby. That child turned out to be Jinny. When Dame Celia and Dr Gerard found out that Lady Boynton had abused all of the children that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> care (including Jinny) even for a short while (like Mr Cope), they decided to kill her for revenge.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} {{matters of}} the palace <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> charge. But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers. She possessed good, high moral standards, which led her to help the poor and needy. When anyone went to see her, they would enter her presence in the same way they did the Sultan's, then take a seat in front of her. She would give them advice and treat them kindly. Perestu had a house in Maçka that Sultan Abdülaziz had presented to her at one time. Nowadays this villa is a school. Three days before Abdul Hamid became Sultan, he went to this villa, and it was from there that he proceeded to Topkapı Palace for the ceremony of homage at his accession. Abdul Hamid presented this villa of Perestu along with all its furniture and household goods to Ahmed Riza Bey, the speaker of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|According to Haggard's {{daughter}} Lilias, {{the phrase}} [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed" [...] originated {{from his childhood}} and [...] "the particularly hideous aspect" [...] of one rag-doll: [...] "This doll {{was something of a}} fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember". Haggard wrote that [...] "the title She" [...] was taken [...] "from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> charge." ...|$|E
500|$|Another single, [...] "Dumb Things", was {{released}} in early 1989 and attained No.36 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart. In the US, it reached No.16 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song was included on the soundtrack for the 1988 Yahoo Serious film Young Einstein. The video, directed by Claudia Castle, won an ARIA Award for 'Best Video'. Kelly met Kaarin Fairfax, his second wife, in 1988 and they married in 1993. From 1989 to 1992 Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as country music artist Mary-Jo Starr, she released three singles and an album, Too Many Movies, using the Messengers and Kelly as session musicians. Michael Armiger, Connolly, and Frawley <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> backing tour band, The Drive-in Motel. Fairfax and Kelly's two children are Madeleine (born 1991) and Memphis (born 1993).|$|E

500|$|Most significant, from Phillips' own {{point of}} view, is her exposé of the [...] "Boys' Club" [...] {{in the higher}} echelons of Hollywood, where she claimed it was her gender that led to her {{ultimate}} ostracism. [...] "If I had been a man, they would have closed ranks around me", she said, referring to her drug addiction. [...] "They hated the woman thing. And I wasn't even regarded as a woman, I was a girl." [...] Writing about her in The Independent in 2002, film critic David Thomson expressed Phillips' attitude as: [...] "you [...] guys don't take women seriously; you like us around... we aren't allowed to be players". Those same few men, like [...] "Valley viper" [...] Mike Ovitz who headed the Creative Artists Agency <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes, responsible for a qualitative decline in standards and the increasing banality of movies since the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E
500|$|From Edward's death, Alexandra was queen mother, being a dowager {{queen and}} the mother of the reigning monarch. She did not attend her son's {{coronation}} in 1911 since it was not customary for a crowned queen to attend the coronation of another king or queen, but otherwise continued the public side of her life, devoting time to her charitable causes. One such cause included Alexandra Rose Day, where artificial roses made by people with disabilities were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers. During the First World War, the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain's highest order of knighthood, the Order of the Garter, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, came under criticism, as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain. Alexandra joined calls to [...] "have down those hateful German banners". Driven by public opinion, but against his own wishes, the king had the banners removed but to Alexandra's dismay he had down not only [...] "those vile Prussian banners" [...] but also those of her Hessian relations who <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> opinion, [...] "simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor's orders". On 17 September 1916, she was at Sandringham during a Zeppelin air raid, but far worse was to befall other members of her family. In Russia, her nephew Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown and he, his wife and children were killed by revolutionaries. Her sister the Dowager Empress was rescued from Russia in 1919 by [...] and brought to England, where she lived for some time with Alexandra.|$|E
