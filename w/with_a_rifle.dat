In addition to their primary functions within the band, the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers, much as a rifleman would salute <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle</b> or a commander would salute with a sabre.|$|E

The Captain's Mate, hunting seals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle,</b> mistakes Aba (passed out on the ice) for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with a harpoon (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his village with his children.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he also became skilled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle,</b> hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E
50|$|The H&R Handy-Gun is a single-shot, breech-loading handgun {{produced}} from 1921 to 1934 by Harrington & Richardson. Two principal variants were produced; one <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> barrel and one smooth-bore.|$|R
50|$|Another {{option is}} to use <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> choke in <b>a</b> smooth-bore barrel, at least for {{shotguns}} having a removable choke tube. Rifled chokes are considerably less expensive than <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> shotgun barrel, and a smooth-bore barrel paired <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> choke is often nearly as accurate as <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> shotgun barrel dedicated for use with slugs. There are many options in selecting shotguns for use with slugs.|$|R
50|$|Sabot-type shotgun slugs were marketed in the United States {{starting}} in about 1985. When used <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> slug barrel, they offer vastly improved accuracy compared to traditional shotgun slugs. They are now legal for hunting in most U.S. states.|$|R
5|$|In August 1914 he {{travelled}} to France as {{a mechanic}} with 3 Squadron after war was declared, which followed the German invasion of Belgium. It operated as a reconnaissance unit and McCudden began to fly as an observer. After stopping at Amiens for several days, the unit began reconnoitering enemy positions. 3 Squadron offered {{support to the}} British Army at the Battle of Mons in Belgium. That month McCudden saw his first German aircraft on 22 August. On 25 August the British began their retreat, south-west, toward Paris. 3 Squadron moved to no fewer than nine different landing grounds, often delaying departure until the enemy was only {{a mile or two}} behind. Eventually they settled at Melun, south of Paris. In the autumn, McCudden participated in locating German artillery positions as the Allied armies drove back the enemy at the First Battle of the Marne and First Battle of the Aisne. McCudden flew these missions <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle</b> since aircraft lacked any fixed armament.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle</b> {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and was not {{supposed}} to participate in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle.</b> She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots.|$|E

5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party's leader, was a full day ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were {{to be taken care of}} by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle</b> and food.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Jo {{is furious}} to {{discover}} that all the chickens have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, she lays traps for the animal and goes after it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle,</b> assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox {{on his own and}} presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag. A subsequent game of hide-and-seek brings out more of the hunter in Kator. Later, Jo is disturbed to find the fox carcass stripped bare and realises that the animal was not caught in a trap as she and Jessica thought. Jessica angrily rejects her warnings about Anders, interpreting Jo's fear as jealousy and revealing that she knows the truth about Simon.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} posse {{is captured}} by Chiricahua Apache Native Americans, who {{blame them for}} the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had travelled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens, who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments to find humans' weaknesses, are far stronger and more durable than humans, and have superior weaponry, but are not invulnerable. They can be stabbed and shot to death, but only Jake's gauntlet weapon or a well-aimed shot <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>rifle</b> can kill them with a single blast. Ella tells them that the aliens which previously attacked them are just scouts.|$|E

At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode on the street. Herod's house and the clock tower are also blown up, and through the smoke and flames, Ellen walks back into town, having faked her death {{with the help of}} Cort, Doc Wallace, the Blind Boy, and the Kid's stash of dynamite. Cort tells Herod that from now on all fights in town will be fair, and proceeds to kill Herod's men who were stationed around town. Ellen and Herod face off, and she finally reveals to him who she is when she throws her father's old badge at Herod's feet. They draw on each other; Herod shoots Ellen in the arm and she fires a shot though Herod's chest. Herod raises his gun to fire again but Ellen shoots him in the eye, finishing him for good. She throws her father's badge to Cort and names him as the new Marshal before saddling up and riding out of the town.|$|E
