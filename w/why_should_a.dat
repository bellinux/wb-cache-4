500|$|Chorus auditions began March 10, 1953 at Broadway's Majestic Theatre; Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Abbott {{listened to}} more than 1,000people. Rehearsals opened at the Majestic for {{principals}} and the Alvin Theatre for dancers. According to Saul Pett, a freelance reporter who was allowed to observe the rehearsals, [...] "everyone seems relaxed except Hammerstein." [...] The lyricist's son James served as second assistant stage manager. James Hammerstein remembered having a difficult relationship with Rodgers; the composer suggested James do his work from front of house, rather than from backstage. [...] "I think {{he thought it was}} his show and his bailiwick. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>a</b> Hammerstein be back there?" [...] James Hammerstein found the lead female dancer attractive, and asked her out. Just before the date, Rodgers fired her, telling James Hammerstein to break the news.|$|E
500|$|Speculation over Hamnet's {{influence}} on Shakespeare's works {{is not limited}} to Hamlet. Richard Wheeler theorises that Hamnet's death influenced the writing of Twelfth Night, which centres on a girl who believes that her twin brother has died. In the end, she finds that her brother never died, but is alive and well. Wheeler also posits the idea that the women who disguise themselves as men in The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night are a representation of William Shakespeare's seeing his son's hope in his daughters after Hamnet's death. Bill Bryson argues that Constance's speech from the third act of King John (written mid-1590s) was inspired by Hamnet's death. In the speech she laments the loss of her son, Arthur. It is possible, though, that Hamnet was still alive when Constance's lament was written. Many other plays of Shakespeare's have theories surrounding Hamnet. These include questions as to whether a scene in Julius Caesar, in which Caesar adopts Mark Antony as a replacement for his dead son is related to Hamnet's death, or whether Romeo and Juliet is a tragic reflection of the loss of a son, or Alonso's guilt over his son's death in The Tempest is related. Sonnet 37 may have also been written in response to Hamnet's death. Shakespeare says in it, [...] "As a decrepit father takes delight / To see his active child do deeds of youth / So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spight / Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth." [...] Still, if this is an allusion to Hamnet, it is a vague one. The grief can echo also {{in one of the most}} painful passages Shakespeare ever wrote, in the end of King Lear where the ruined monarch recognizes his daughter is dead: [...] "No, no, no life! / <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>a</b> dog, a horse, a rat, have life, / And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more, / Never, never, never, never, never!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{views of}} various {{religious}} entities {{on the decision}} split between mainline Protestants and Jews, who in general strongly supported the decision, and evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics, who strongly opposed the decision. Speaking from the conservative Protestant perspective, the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham said, [...] "n my opinion ... the Supreme Court ... is wrong. ... Eighty percent of the American people want Bible reading and prayer in the schools. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>a</b> majority be so severely penalized ...?" [...] The mainline denominations, {{with the exception of}} the Roman Catholic Church, registered less critical opinions of the verdict, in fact seeing it as a boon to religious freedom by its very limiting of governmental authority in the sphere of public schools.|$|E

2500|$|More {{difficult}} for Darwin were highly evolved and complicated features that conveyed apparently no adaptive {{advantage to the}} organism. Writing to colleague Asa Gray in 1860, Darwin commented that he remembered well a [...] "time when {{the thought of the}} eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>a</b> bird like the peacock develop such an elaborate tail, which seemed at best to be a hindrance in its [...] "struggle for existence"? To answer the question, Darwin had introduced in the Origin the theory of sexual selection, which outlined how different characteristics could be selected for if they conveyed a reproductive advantage to the individual. In this theory, male animals in particular showed heritable features acquired by sexual selection, such as [...] "weapons" [...] with which to fight over females with other males, or beautiful plumage with which to woo the female animals. Much of Descent is devoted to providing evidence for sexual selection in nature, which he also ties into the development of aesthetic instincts in human beings, as well as the differences in coloration between the human races.|$|E
