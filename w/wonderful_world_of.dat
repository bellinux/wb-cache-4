25|$|In 1959, Walt Disney Productions, having {{improved}} {{its financial}} situation, had purchased ABC's {{shares in the}} Disneyland theme park for $7.5 million and initiated discussions to renew ABC's television contract for Walt Disney Presents, which was due to expire in 1961. Walt Disney was approached by NBC to produce color broadcasts of his anthology series (which would be renamed Walt Disney's <b>Wonderful</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Color). Goldenson said ABC could not counter the offer, because the network {{did not have the}} technical and financial resources to carry the program in the format. As a result, ABC and Disney's first television collaboration ended in 1961 (the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985, when the anthology series returned to the network for a three-season run as the Disney Sunday Movie until it lost the rights to NBC again in 1988; the Disney anthology series would return to ABC in 1996, following the company's purchase of the future Capital Cities/ABC, as The <b>Wonderful</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Disney).|$|E
25|$|In {{a display}} of foresight, Disney had filmed many of its earlier shows in color so {{they were able to}} be {{repeated}} on NBC, and since most of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color, they could now also be telecast in that format. To emphasize the new feature, the series was re-dubbed Walt Disney's <b>Wonderful</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Color, which premiered in September 1961, and retained that moniker until 1969.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of color TV, CBS and RCA offered rival formats but {{initially}} neither gained market traction. Viewers had little reason to buy expensive color TVs {{in the absence of}} color programming. Likewise, broadcasters had little reason to develop color programming when households lacked color TVs. RCA won the battle in two ways. It flooded the market with low cost black-and-white TVs incompatible with the CBS format but compatible with its own. Broadcasters then needed to use the RCA format to reach established viewers. RCA also subsidized Walt Disney's <b>Wonderful</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Color, which gave consumers reason to buy the new technology.|$|E

Both Boag and The Golden Horseshoe Revue were cited in The Guinness Book of World Records for having the greatest number of performances of any theatrical presentation.
