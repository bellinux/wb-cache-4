40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{consumers}} are increasingly demanding {{in relation to}} cherry, expecting fruits with good size, firmness and flavour, while the producer aims to achieve higher and regular yields, searching to reduce fruit losses, mainly caused by fruit cracking, which is related to several factors, including genotype, soil type and volume and intensity of rainfall (1 - 4). The climate change predictions point {{to an increase in}} the duration of excess rainfall before harvest that may cause higher cherry cracking. Several strategies to reduce this physiological disorder are described, mainly the application of minerals or other chemicals, that delay or reduces the water uptake to fruit, increase the transpiration of free water from the fruit surface or improve the fruit skin properties (5 - 7). Therefore, this work aimed to study the effect of a biostimulant application in production, size, cracking index, cracking size, fruit <b>waxes</b> <b>content,</b> pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids and nutritional characteristics of the fruits from two cherry cultivars, Sweetheart and Skeena, grafted on Gisela 6. This study was carried out in an orchard installed in Carrazedo de Montenegro, northeast of Portugal. The treatment consisted in the application of a biostimulant composed mainly of seaweed extract (Ascophyllum nodosum) in three applications during 2014. For both cultivars, the application of the biostimulant promoted a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) of cracking index and a significant increase (p< 0. 05) of weight, width, diameter, pH and fruit <b>waxes</b> <b>content.</b> Furthermore, negative correlations were found between cracking size and fruit dimensions (weight, r=- 0. 575 and diameter, r=- 0. 517; p< 0. 05). Regarding nutritional characteristics, the quality of the fruits was unaffected by the treatment with biostimulant, while yield remained constant. This study showed that the application of biostimulant reduced the production losses caused by cracking without compromising either the quality or the yield in the studied cultivars...|$|R

A significant factor in its gain in popularity was the ability of synthetic-based lubricants to remain fluid in the sub-zero temperatures of the Eastern front in wintertime, temperatures which caused petroleum-based lubricants to solidify owing to their higher <b>wax</b> <b>content.</b> The use of synthetic lubricants widened through the 1950s and 1960s owing to a property {{at the other end}} of the temperature spectrum, the ability to lubricate aviation engines at temperatures that caused mineral-based lubricants to break down. In the mid-1970s, synthetic motor oils were formulated and commercially applied for the first time in automotive applications. The same SAE system for designating motor oil viscosity also applies to synthetic oils. Synthetic oils are derived from either Group III, Group IV, or some Group V bases. Synthetics include classes of lubricants like synthetic esters as well as [...] "others" [...] like GTL (Methane Gas-to-Liquid) (Group V) and polyalpha-olefins (Group IV). Higher purity and therefore better property control theoretically means synthetic oil has better mechanical properties at extremes of high and low temperatures. The molecules are made large and [...] "soft" [...] enough to retain good viscosity at higher temperatures, yet branched molecular structures interfere with solidification and therefore allow flow at lower temperatures. Thus, although the viscosity still decreases as temperature increases, these synthetic motor oils have a higher viscosity index over the traditional petroleum base. Their specially designed properties allow a wider temperature range at higher and lower temperatures and often include a lower pour point. With their improved viscosity index, synthetic oils need lower levels of viscosity index improvers, which are the oil components most vulnerable to thermal and mechanical degradation as the oil ages, and thus they do not degrade as quickly as traditional motor oils. However, they still fill up with particulate matter, although the matter better suspends within the oil, and the oil filter still fills and clogs up over time. So, periodic oil and filter changes should still be done with synthetic oil; but some synthetic oil suppliers suggest that the intervals between oil changes can be longer, sometimes as long as 16,000-24,000 km (10,000-15,000 mi) primarily due to reduced degradation by oxidation.|$|E
