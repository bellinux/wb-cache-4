Since the Apple IIGS was the first Apple product to debut in the new gray color they called Platinum, the 20SC had to both match it and the beige color of the Macintosh Plus, which it is designed to sit perfectly beneath. In 1987, all Apple products would change to Platinum, which would remain in use for the next 10 years.|$|E

5000|$|While butter that cows {{produced}} had {{a slightly}} yellow color, margarine {{had a white}} color, making the margarine look more like lard, which look many people found unappetizing. Around the late 1880s, the manufacturers decided to dye the margarine yellow, so it would sell more. Dairy firms, especially in Wisconsin, became alarmed and succeeded in getting legislation passed to prohibit the coloring of the stark <b>white</b> <b>product.</b> In response, the margarine companies distributed the margarine together with a packet of yellow dye. The product {{was placed in a}} bowl and the dye mixed in manually. This took some time and effort, and it was not unusual for the final product to be served as a light and dark yellow, or even white, striped product. During World War II, there was a shortage of butter in the United States, and [...] "oleomargarine" [...] became popular. In 1951, the W.E. Dennison Company received [...] for a method to place a capsule of yellow dye inside a plastic package of margarine. After purchase, the capsule was broken inside the package, and then the package was kneaded to distribute the dye. Around 1955, the artificial coloring laws were repealed, and margarine could for the first time be sold colored like butter.|$|E

A <b>white</b> <b>product</b> obtained by hydrolyzing aluminum isopropoxide in water at 80 °C was peptized using acetic acid at 80 °C, which transformed the <b>white</b> <b>product</b> to a transparent alumina sol. α-Al 2 O 3 particles {{were added to the}} alumina sol as seed material; the sol containing α-Al 2 O 3 particles was then transformed to an α-Al 2 O 3 -seeded alumina gel by drying the sol at room temperature. The non-seeded alumina gel remained boehmite after annealing at 300 °C and crystallized into γ-Al 2 O 3 and α-Al 2 O 3 at temperatures between 300 and 500 °C and between 900 and 1100 °C, respectively. The α-Al 2 O 3 seeding promoted crystallization of the alumina gel into α-Al 2 O 3. The promotion of crystallization was significant with an increase in α-Al 2 O 3 particle content by weight in the final seeded alumina gel. With an α-Al 2 O 3 particle content of 5 %, the seeded alumina gel was partially crystallized into α-Al 2 O 3 by annealing at a temperature as low as 900 °C...|$|E

40|$|Although {{egg white}} {{is known as}} expressing {{efficient}} antimicrobial properties under physiological conditions, little is known on the microbial quality of industrial egg white. This issue is of great importance when egg white enters into the composition of highly perishable products, such as chilled egg-based desserts.
