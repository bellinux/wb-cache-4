Lebrón appeared as a witness at the [...] "International Tribunal on Violations of Human Rights in Puerto Rico and Vieques" [...] held on November 17–21, 2000, {{on the island of}} Vieques. According to the local newspaper El Vocero, her audience applauded when Lebrón said {{at the end of her}} deposition [...] "I had the honor of leading the act against the U.S. Congress on March 1, 1954, when we demanded freedom for Puerto Rico and <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> world that we are an invaded nation, occupied and abused by the United States of America. I feel very proud of having performed that day, of having answered the call of the motherland". On June 26, 2001, Lebrón was among a group of protesters that were arrested for trespassing in the restricted area in Vieques. On July 19, 2001, she was sentenced to 60 days of prison on the charge that she was trespassing on Navy property. Lebrón had already served 23 days in jail since her June arrest, leaving her to serve 37 additional days. Less than two years after Lebron's Vieques protest, on May 1, 2003, the U.S. Navy left Vieques and turned over its facilities to the government of Puerto Rico. Following this, she continued her participation in other pro independence activities. Lebrón was among the political leaders that opposed the Democratic Party's primary that took place on June 1, 2008. The group anticipated a low voter turnout in the event, while declaring that Puerto Rico [...] "deserves sovereignty". On June 10, 2008, Lebrón suffered a fracture in her hip and a wrist after accidentally falling in her house. She underwent corrective surgery at a San Juan hospital. A film inspired by Lebrón's life is currently in the works, with actress Eva Longoria being involved.|$|E

In April 1996, he wrote an article for the Daily Express where he said: [...] "Those who consented to the surrender made in 1972 will have to think again. Thinking again means that activity most unthinkable for politicians—unsaying what has been said. The surrender... we have made is not irrevocable. Parliament still has the power (thank God) to reclaim what has been surrendered by treaty. It is time <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> other European nations what we mean by being self-governed".

She almost fainted when we showed her our badges, and said we must arrest him, on his return, as a notorious highwayman and breaker of the laws. She exclaimed that her house would be ruined, and it took some time to pacify her, by saying that we would manage the job so quietly that no one in the house need know of it, and that we would, if possible, arrange it so that the place of his arrest should not be made public.|$|E

Often the strongest till then become the weakest, while the weakest, as it were, reach up and steal strength from the Gods. So it was with us. Yet my Pertinax by his jests and his courtesy and his labours had put heart and training into our poor numbers during the past years--more than I should have thought possible. Even our Libyan Cohort--the Third--stood up in their padded cuirasses and did not whimper.|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{that short}} day we spent in setting up our tent in the cave, in front of which we lit a large fire, and {{in a survey of}} the slopes of the mountain, for <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> monk that we were searching for the tracks of wild sheep. Indeed, as it happened, on our way back to the cave we came across a small herd of ewes feeding upon the mosses in a {{sheltered}} spot where in summer a streamlet ran. Of these we were so fortunate as to kill two, for no sportsman had ever come here, and they were tame enough, poor things. As meat would keep for ever in that temperature, we had now sufficient food to last us for a fortnight, and dragging the animals down the snow slopes to the cave, we skinned them by the dying light.|$|E

The boys, who got kind of savage, found a pole and drove the door in, but we turned the Sheriff, who had already sworn some of us in, loose on them. Four or five men were nastily clubbed, and one of James's boys was shot through the arm, while I have a fancy that the {{citizens}} would have stood in with the other crowd; but seeing {{they were not going}} to get anything to eat there, they held up a store, and as <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> man who kept it how their friends had sacked Regent, he fired at them. The consequence is that the Sheriff has some of them in jail, and the rest are camped down on the prairie. We hold the town." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{vessel was}} an English bark, full of soldiers, bound to New Brunswick. She had sprung a leak, like ourselves, {{and was only}} kept afloat by {{constant}} pumping and bailing. She had put back for England {{on account of the}} wind and the distance. Our captain was asked to keep near the transport, and we shortened sail accordingly. For three days and nights the two vessels ran side by side, within hail; our passengers and officers drinking to theirs, and vice versâ, at dinner. On the fourth day, the weather being fine, the wind fair, and our reckoning making us near the channel, <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Englishman we would run ahead, make the land, and heave-to. We stood in so far that the poor fellows owned afterwards they thought we had left them. This was not our intention, however, for we no sooner made the land than we hauled up, and brought them the joyful news of its vicinity. They cheered us again, as we closed with them, and both ships jogged on in company.|$|E
6000|$|After {{spending}} the night in Bridgewater, and picking up a few arrow-heads there in the morning, we took the cars for Sandwich, where we arrived before noon. This was the terminus of the [...] "Cape Cod Railroad," [...] though it is but {{the beginning of the}} Cape. As it rained hard, with driving mists, and {{there was no sign of}} its holding up, we here took that almost obsolete conveyance, the stage, for [...] "as far as it went that day," [...] as <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> driver. We had for-gotten how far a stage could go in a day, but we were told that the Cape roads were very [...] "heavy," [...] though they added that, being of sand, the rain would improve them. This coach was an exceedingly narrow one, but as there was a slight spherical excess over two on a seat, the driver waited till nine passengers had got in, without taking the measure of any of them, and then shut the door after two or three ineffectual slams, as if the fault were all in the hinges or the latch,--while we timed our inspirations and expirations so as to assist him.|$|E
