5|$|An {{example of}} inoculative release {{occurs in the}} horticultural {{production}} of several crops in greenhouses. Periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp, Encarsia formosa, are used to control greenhouse <b>whitefly,</b> while the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis is used {{for control of the}} two-spotted spider mite.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of <b>whitefly,</b> a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young <b>whitefly</b> 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of <b>whitefly.</b> It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control <b>whitefly</b> pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E
40|$|<b>Whiteflies</b> {{are serious}} pests of cotton, melons, and winter {{vegetables}} in Arizona’s low deserts. Successful management of <b>whiteflies</b> requires an integrated approach, a critical element {{of which is}} routine pest monitoring. In this paper we report findings of our 1999 investigations of resistance of Arizona <b>whiteflies</b> to insect growth regulators (IGRs) and chloronicotinyl insecticides. <b>Whiteflies</b> collected from cotton fields, melon fields and greenhouses were tested for susceptibility to imidacloprid (Admire/Provado), and two other chloronicotinyl insecticides, acetamiprid and thiamethoxam, and to two insect growth regulators (IGRs), buprofezin (Applaud) and pyriproxyfen (Knack). Contrasts of 1999 and 1998 results indicated increased susceptibilities, on average, to both imidacloprid and buprofezin of <b>whiteflies</b> collected from cotton. A cropping system study showed that <b>whiteflies</b> collected from spring melons had significantly lower susceptibility to imidacloprid than those collected from cotton or fall melons. The opposite was found for pyriproxyfen, to which <b>whiteflies</b> from cotton and fall melons had lower susceptibility than those from spring melons. As in 1998, <b>whiteflies</b> with reduced susceptibility to imidacloprid continue {{to be found in}} certain locations, particularly in spring melon fields and greenhouses. Results of our laboratory bioassays on susceptibility of Arizona <b>whiteflies</b> to chloronicotinyl insecticides provided evidence of a low order cross-resistance between imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiamethoxam. Monitoring in 1999 provided the first evidence of reduced susceptibility of Arizona <b>whiteflies</b> to pyriproxyfen...|$|R
50|$|<b>Whiteflies</b> feed {{by tapping}} into the phloem of plants, {{introducing}} toxic saliva and decreasing the plants' overall turgor pressure. Since <b>whiteflies</b> congregate in large numbers, susceptible plants can be quickly overwhelmed. Further harm is done by mold growth encouraged by the honeydew <b>whiteflies</b> secrete. This may also seriously impede the ability of farms to process cotton harvests.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{new possibilities}} to control <b>whiteflies</b> in greenhouse ornamental crops with omnivorous predatory bugs and volatiles. Besides the well-known Macrolophus pygmaeus, we tested 4 {{new species of}} predatory bugs: Dicyphus errans, Dicyphus eckerleini, Dicyphus maroccanus and Dicyphus tamaninii. We assessed both their potential to control <b>whiteflies</b> and their possible plant damaging effects through plant feeding. The best control of <b>whiteflies</b> was achieved by the species M. pygmaeus, D. tamaninii and D. maroccanus. Significant flower damage was only observed for the predator M. pygmaeus. The degree of flower damage depended strongly on the gerbera cultivar, but damage was observed for both large-flowered and small-flowered types. All 5 species of predatory bugs were able to establish in a winter crop of 2 gerbera cultivars and the exotic plant Lantana camara. The most promising candidate predatory bug for biological control in gerbera is D. maroccanus. This species established well on the 2 tested gerbera cultivars, gave in all cases an excellent control of pests and no significant plant damage was observed. The predatory bugs gave, besides <b>whiteflies,</b> a good control of Echinothrips {{and in some cases}} a suppression of aphids and western flower thrips. The volatile limonene showed no significant effect on the oviposition of tobacco and greenhouse <b>whiteflies.</b> Neither did they repel adults of these <b>whiteflies.</b> The mixture of (E) - 2 -hexenal and 3 -hexen- 1 -ol did not induce a significant attraction response of the adult <b>whiteflies...</b>|$|R
5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf <b>whitefly)</b> as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} known wasps, such as yellowjackets and hornets, {{are in the}} family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Many of the solitary wasps are parasitoidal, meaning that they raise their young by laying eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult). Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every pest insect, making wasps valuable in horticulture for biological pest control of species such as <b>whitefly</b> in tomatoes and other crops.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, <b>whitefly</b> and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{susceptibility}} to insecticides of <b>whiteflies</b> (Bemisia tabaci) collected from cotton, melons and ornamental plans during the 2004 season. No major problems with field performance of insecticides against <b>whiteflies</b> were observed or reported in 2004 in Arizona cotton, vegetables, or melons. However, monitoring revealed further statewide reduction in susceptibility to pyriproxyfen (Knack®) {{and showed that}} <b>whiteflies</b> possessing pyriproxyfen resistance could be detected in all low desert areas of the state. Susceptibility to buprofezin (Applaud®/Courier®) has not changed significantly since 1997. Mean susceptibility to synergized pyrethroids (e. g., Danitol ® + Orthene®) has increased strikingly on a statewide basis since 1995 though highly resistant <b>whiteflies</b> were detected in some collections from cotton, melons and ornamentals. <b>Whiteflies</b> from throughout Arizona continued to be highly susceptible to imidacloprid (Admire®/Provado®). However, susceptibility to the related neonicotinoid insecticide, acetamiprid (Intruder®) varied widely and was lowest in collections from melons and greenhouse plants. <b>Whiteflies</b> from cotton that were least susceptibile to acetamiprid were significantly less susceptible to a second neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam (Actara®/Centric®/Platinum®). The most worrisome findings of our 2004 studies stemmed from detection of a strain of B tabaci, at a retail nursery, that was essentially unaffected by pyriproxyfen in egg bioassays. It also possessed strikingly reduced susceptibility t...|$|R

25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, <b>whitefly,</b> the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed mealybug under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe.

25|$|The {{immediate}} ancestry of the cultivated olive is unknown. O. europaea {{may have}} arisen from O. chrysophylla in northern tropical Africa and was {{introduced into the}} countries of the Mediterranean Basin via Egypt and then Crete or the Levant, Tunisia, and Asia Minor. Fossil Olea pollen has been found in Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus is an original element of the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of Olea were found in the palaeosols of the volcanic Greek island of Santorini (Thera) and were dated about 37,000 BP. Imprints of larvae of olive <b>whitefly</b> Aleurolobus (Aleurodes) olivinus were found on the leaves. The same insect is commonly found today on olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary relations have not changed since that time. Other leaves found on the same island are dated back to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest known olives from the Mediterranean.|$|E
