5|$|Widespread across Australia, the Australian pelican has a {{population}} generally estimated at between 300,000 and 500,000 individuals.

50|$|By far {{the most}} popular {{laboratory}} rodent, the C57BL/6 mouse accounts for half to five-sixths of all rodents shipped to research laboratories from American suppliers.

5|$|Demand for Juventus {{tickets in}} {{occasional}} home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support {{in other parts}} of the country. Juventus is <b>widely</b> <b>and</b> especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches, more than in Turin itself.|$|E
5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary <b>widely</b> <b>and</b> tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to run graphical user interfaces on older or low-end systems, but the installation of window managers instead of desktop environments is recommended, as desktop environments are more resource-intensive.

5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated <b>widely</b> <b>and</b> effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E

5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary <b>widely,</b> <b>and</b> may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E

5|$|Stebbins took an {{appointment}} at the University of California, Davis in 1950, {{where he was}} a key figure in the establishment of the University's Department of Genetics; he was the Department's first chairman and held the position from 1958 to 1963. At Davis, the focus of his research changed to incorporate newer areas, such as developmental morphology and genetics in crop plants, including barley. He continued to publish <b>widely</b> <b>and</b> extensively on plant evolution, writing over 200 papers and several books after 1950.|$|E

5|$|The {{release of}} Boom Box {{received}} very little coverage from music critics {{because it was}} not a studio album. The few reviews it received were positive. The album charted at number 206 on the Top Internet Albums. However, in its separate release, The Singles 1992–2003 was reviewed <b>widely</b> <b>and</b> positively, and it charted highly across North America and Europe, peaking at number 2 in the US and number 5 in the UK. Everything in Time, in its separate release, charted on the US Billboard 200 at number 182.|$|E
5|$|The {{species are}} native to meadows and woods in {{southern}} Europe and North Africa with {{a center of}} diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised <b>widely,</b> <b>and</b> were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling <b>widely,</b> <b>and</b> interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley soon {{gave up his}} apprenticeship, {{and after}} a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here he picked up a working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more <b>widely</b> <b>and</b> introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E
5|$|Custine's son, Renaud-Louis-Philippe-Francois, (b. in Paris in 1768 {{and died}} 3 January 1794), also called Armand, was a captain {{in one of}} the regiments in the Army of the Rhine. As a young man, he had {{traveled}} <b>widely,</b> <b>and</b> made a long study of the art of war in Berlin. Comte de Mirabeau, ever the politician, predicted that the young Custine would become a well-respected diplomat. By 1792, Armand was Nicholas Luckner's aide-de-camp; following Luckner's dismissal, he entered a brief embassy duty in Berlin in 1792 as chargé de affaires and eventually, as diplomatic relations between France and the rest of Europe became strained, he was a hostage for the safe return of Prussian and Austrian diplomats in Paris. His deceased mother had left him capital of 700,000 livres, making him a wealthy young man; it was assumed that his father would also settle a suitable amount on him upon his marriage as well as the family estates in Niderviller, which included six farms.|$|E
