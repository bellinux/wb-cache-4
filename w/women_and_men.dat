5|$|The kulintang is {{traditionally}} considered a women’s instrument by many groups: the Maguindanao, Maranao, Tausūg/Suluk, Samal, Badjao/Sama, Iranun, Kadazan, Murut, Bidayuh and Iban.

Nowadays, the traditional view of kulintang as strictly for women has waned as both <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> play all five instruments, {{with some of the}} more renowned kulintang players being men.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life.

The introductory part of the work starts treating gender on a general level and then preceeds to a specifical gender analysis of textbooks.

40|$|Women in Love is {{interpreted}} as a novel of relationships between <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> nature, and mind and body. D. H.

It also suggests regenerating natural and inexorable relationships between <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>and</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> nature to explore the mystery of life...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{definitions}} of gender equality. The first is according to United Nation Development Program {{and the second}} is in line with of Islamic view. The difference between its definitions lies in the implementation of total and balance equality. Total equality, as UNDP determiÂ­nes, is that <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>man</b> are totally equal (50 / 50) in all aspects. But Islamic view suggests that both <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>man</b> are equal with harmony. The meaning of harmony does not just equality for <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>man</b> in all aspects but also refer to difference between them. Sometimes woman have better chance than man, an in other times the fact suggests the reverse. But still other, <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>man</b> have same good chance. To socialize this thinking and Islamic view, education hold an important role. Socialization can run in Islamic education institution. One of the Islamic education institutions is Islamic university. </p...|$|R
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> {{religious}} {{engage in}} a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries. While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles {{in the life of the}} church, with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the Church's worldwide health and education service networks.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences between <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> exist. Women also need health care more and access {{the health care system}} more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
