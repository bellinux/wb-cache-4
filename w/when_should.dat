25|$|<b>When</b> <b>should</b> {{a public}} good be provided? Take, for example, a {{community}} of just two consumers {{and the government is}} considering whether or not to build a public park. Arthur is prepared to pay up to $200 for its use, while Julia is willing to pay up to $100. The total value to the two individuals of having the park is $300. If it can be produced for $225, there is a $75 gain on its production since it provides services that the community values at $300 at a cost of only $225.|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times, Arthur Caplan, {{professor}} of bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, felt that medical dramas such as Kelley's Chicago Hope {{do a good}} job of addressing bioethical issues such as who should receive a liver transplant or <b>when</b> <b>should</b> a patient be allowed to die. However, there is a lack of discussion concerning the primary money issue: [...] "How do people pay for this?" [...] The show has been criticized for presenting a one-sided view of managed care, portraying HMOs as dramatically evil while glossing over the complexities. Doctors are too often shown as selfless patient advocates ready to battle whatever the financial cost.|$|E

2500|$|Taking in {{view the}} {{characteristics}} of this evolution towards petty politics, he vehemently rejected Mihai Eminescu's theory on the almost exclusively foreign origin of the bourgeoisie inside the post-Phanariote Old Kingdom. Instead, Rădulescu-Motru expanded on Titu Maiorescu's criticism of [...] "forms without fundament" [...] (in reference to {{the discrepancy between the}} Westernized facade and the underdeveloped economic and social setting), viewing the class of low-ranking boyars, increasingly attracted to Liberal currents during the 19th century, as the main agents of incoherent change– this attracted him the criticism of the Poporanist Garabet Ibrăileanu, who argued that Junimea was an exclusivist school of criticism that [...] "has never said [...] what, how much, and <b>when</b> <b>should</b> be imported". In this context, Ibrăileanu emphasized the gestures of boyars before and during the Organic Regulation government, as indicative of a skeptical nationalist mood (rather than of a cosmopolitan ideology).|$|E

60|$|Three {{weeks of}} this self-imposed strenuous {{training}} wore by before Carley was free enough from weariness and pain to experience other sensations.
