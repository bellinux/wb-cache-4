5000|$|Mage Knight {{figures were}} sold in Starter Packs (which {{historically}} contained eight or nine figures along with rules and dice) and Booster Packs (four or five figures). Figures {{were sold in}} base sets, as well as expansion sets, and distributed with seven rarity levels. Levels 1 through 5 {{were assigned to the}} standard [...] "infantry" [...] figures, each of which was available in 3 power levels: Weak, Standard and Tough. Low power and cost figure were of 1-2-3 rarity, middle range figures were 2-3-4, and stronger army figures were 3-4-5. Level 6 figures were Uniques, which carried the stipulation that only one of any individual Unique could appear in a players army. In addition, WizKids gave away limited edition, Unique versions of the non-Unique figures in the sets as prizes for tournaments in comic and game shops. These figures are not generally available for retail sale, and have different statistics and point costs than the regular figures. This novel prize policy was in part responsible for Mage Knights success. Some expansions had ultra-rare [...] "chase" [...] figures, listed as rarity level 7, which were produced in limited quantities and found randomly in boosters, such as the Apocalypse Horsemen in Sinister or the glow-in-the-dark variants from Minions. Finally, <b>Wiz</b> <b>Kids</b> also sold larger figures individually. The figures, which included dragons, chariots, war machines and giants, had multiple combat dials that applied to each side of the figure to make them harder to kill and allow them multiple attacks.

50|$|Two demons from Limbo, S'ym and N'astirh, plan a demonic {{invasion}} of Earth. Their plan revolves around Illyana Rasputin of the New Mutants, as her mutant power {{allows her to}} open passages between Limbo and Earth. During one of the New Mutants' routine stopovers in Limbo, N'astirh casts a spell blocking Illyana's teleportation power, thus trapping the New Mutants in Limbo with S'ym, who has taken control of Limbo's hordes and is eager to kill the New Mutants in order to solidify his claim to Limbo. Illyana assumes that the entrapment spell was cast by S'ym, and so sees no reason to distrust N'astirh when he advises her that she can return to Earth by embracing her demonic power. She does so and opens a gateway to Manhattan. N'astirh had kidnapped <b>Wiz</b> <b>Kid</b> of the X-Terminators and coerced him into building a spell-casting computer; once Illyana opened the gateway, he uses this computer to cast a spell holding it open.|$|E
