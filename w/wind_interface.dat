We present the first resolved images of this dust shell, at binary phases ~ 0. 039 and ~ 0. 055, using aperture masking techniques on the Keck-I telescope to achieve diffraction-limited resolution. Proper motions of approximately 1. 1 milliarcsecond per day were detected, implying a distance ~ 1. 5 kpc from the known wind speed. The dust plume observed is not as simple as the ``pinwheel'' nebulae seen around other WR colliding wind binaries, indicating the orbital plane is highly inclined to our line-of-sight and/or the dust formation is very clumpy. Follow-up imaging in the mid-infrared and with adaptive optics is urgently required to track the dust motion further, necessary for unambiguously determining the orbital geometry which we only partially constrain here.

40|$|A stellar wind {{passing through}} the reverse shock is {{deflected}} into the astrospheric tail and leaves the stellar system either as a sub-Alfvenic or as a super-Alfvenic tail flow. An example is our own heliosphere and its heliotail. We present an analytical method of calculating stationary, incompressible, and field-aligned plasma flows in the astrotail of a star. We present a recipe for constructing an astrosphere {{with the help of}} only a few parameters, like the inner Alfven Mach number and the outer Alfven Mach number, the magnetic field strength within and outside the stellar wind cavity, and the distribution of singular points of the magnetic field within these flows. Within the framework of a one-fluid approximation, it is possible to obtain solutions of the MHD equations for stationary flows from corresponding static MHD equilibria, by using noncanonical mappings of the canonical variables. The canonical variables are the Euler potentials of the magnetic field of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. Thus we start from static equilibria determined by the distribution of magnetic neutral points, and assume that the Alfven Mach number for the corresponding stationary equilibria is finite. The topological structure determines the geometrical structure of the interstellar gas - stellar <b>wind</b> <b>interface.</b> Additional boundary conditions like the outer magnetic field and the jump of the magnetic field across the astropause allow determination of the noncanonical transformations. This delivers the strength of the magnetic field at every point in the astrotail region beyond the reverse shock. The mathematical technique for describing such a scenario is applied to astrospheres in general, but is also relevant for the heliosphere. It shows the restrictions of the outer and the inner magnetic field strength in comparison with the corresponding Alfven Mach numbers in the case of subalfvenic flows.

40|$|Abstract- Optical fibers are {{structures}} that are typically designed to transmit energy along a specified trajectory with minimal attenuation and single distortion. Optical fibers with small losses appeared in 1970. This event has {{laid the foundation}} for modern optical communication industry. However Si waveguides have some nonlinearity which occurs when electromagnetic waves interact with core ofthe waveguide. To do away with this problem it was begun to use Optical fibers with helical winding known as complex optical waveguides. Also in conventional waveguide modes are mixed with adjacent mode if V number is greater than 2. 405. The use of helical winding in optical fibers makes the analysis much accurate. As the number of propagating modes depends on the helix pitch angle, so helical <b>winding</b> at core-cladding <b>interface</b> can control the dispersion or propagation characteristics ofthe optical waveguide. The model dispersion characteristics of circular optical waveguide with helical <b>winding</b> at core-cladding <b>interface</b> are obtained for different pitch angle. This paper gives the idea to obtain dispersion characteristics, and comparison of dispersion characteristics at different pitch angles. We obtained the dispersion characteristics by using boundary condition and this condition have been utilized to get the model Eigen values equation. From these Eigen value equations dispersion curve are obtained and plotted for five particular values of the pitch angle of the winding.

Quite obviously, the windward faces are subjected to positive pressure coefficients because of the undeviating wind force. Because of frictional flow separation and generation of vortices, the leeward faces are exposed to suction. Flow separation characteristics and vortices are quite apparent from the streamlines. The pressure force on the windward side and suction force on the leeward side in combination produce vortices in the wake region, causing the deflection of the body.
