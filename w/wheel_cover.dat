25|$|In 2009 (2010 US {{model year}} vehicles), S models {{received}} the Optitron XRS gauges as standard equipment and new 16-inch steel <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> designs. XLE models were now available with an optional automatic climate control and a metallic finish to {{the steering wheel}} panels. All models now have The Star Safety System includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), Traction Control (TRAC), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA) and Smart Stop Technology brake override system as standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were four}} wheel options this year. The {{first was the}} [...] "custom wheel cover" [...] {{standard}} on the Base model, full styled <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> (stainless steel) standard on Concord D/L, the wire <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> standard on Limited models, and the 14×7inch [...] "Turbocast II" [...] aluminum wheels that were optional on all 1981 models. There were 15 exterior paint colors this year, they were Olympic white, classic black, quick silver metallic, steel gray met, medium blue metallic, moonlight blue, autumn gold, Sherwood green metallic, cameo tan, copper brown metallic, medium brown metallic, dark brown metallic, Oriental red, vintage red metallic, and deep maroon metallic.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S., {{during the}} age of custom cars (1950s-early 1960s), decorating one car with the <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> from another was common. Two very {{desirable}} <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> were those of the 1950 Cadillac (called the [...] "Sombrero") {{and that of the}} 1953 to 1955 Oldsmobile, which resembled a huge, three-tined spinner. Aftermarket suppliers included the [...] "Mooneyes" [...] brand (named after the firm's founder Dean Moon) hubcaps and <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> that were some of the first independently offered for hot rods and custom cars.|$|R
2500|$|The Australian higher {{specification}} {{model was}} called the [...] "Sport". It was added {{at the time of}} the first facelift and included body-colored bumpers, mirrors, door handles, and hard rear spare <b>wheel</b> <b>cover.</b> It also included alloy wheels, roof rails, and a large glass sunroof. The CR-V became the country's best-selling SUV in 2000, outselling the Toyota Landcruiser for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|For 1972, all VAM cars {{received}} the same revisions and improvements of the AMC models. The Classic line saw upgrades in {{the replacement of the}} [...] six in favor of the [...] with gross [...] at 4,400 RPM with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor, 9.5 compression ratio, and 266 degree camshaft. Power brakes with front disks became standard equipment regardless of transmission, a Chrysler A998 three-speed automatic transmission in place of the older Borg-Warner automatics, heavy-duty suspension with front sway bar, improved heater with revised controls placed {{to the right of the}} steering column, and new two-round-pod instrument cluster. New <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> and grille designs were noticeable on the exterior, while seat patterns and side panels were also updated.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were four}} kinds of wheel {{treatments}} this year, {{they were the}} [...] "Custom Wheel Cover", [...] "Full Styled <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> (Noryl) which was standard on the Spirit DL, the [...] "Spoke Styled Wheels" [...] which were standard on the Spirit G.T. and the [...] "Turbocast II Aluminum wheels which were optional on all models. Fifteen exterior paint colors were available in 1981. They were Olympic White, Classic Black, Quick Silver Metallic, Steel Gray Metallic, Medium Blue Metallic, Moonlight Blue, Autumn Gold, Sherwood Green Metallic, Cameo Tan, Copper Brown Metallic, Medium Brown Metallic, Dark Brown Metallic, Oriental Red, Vintage Red Metallic, and Deep Maroon Metallic. Interiors were available in [...] "Deluxe Grain" [...] vinyl in black, blue, beige, and nutmeg. [...] "Coventry Check" [...] fabric was available in black, blue, beige, and nutmeg.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} it was realised that some buyers would want a Land Rover's abilities without the spartan interiors. In 1949, Land Rover launched a second body option called the [...] "Station Wagon", fitted with a body built by Tickford, a coachbuilder known for their work with Rolls-Royce and Lagonda. The bodywork was wooden-framed and had seating for seven people. Tickford was well equipped {{in comparison with the}} standard Land Rover, having leather seats, a heater, a one-piece laminated windscreen, a tin-plate spare <b>wheel</b> <b>cover,</b> some interior trim and other options. The wooden construction made them expensive to build. [...] The Tickford was taxed as a private car, which attracted high levels of Purchase Tax unlike the original Land Rover. As a result, fewer than 700 Tickfords were sold, and all but 50 were exported.|$|E
2500|$|The 1972 {{model year}} VAM models {{incorporated}} the same engineering revisions and upgrades of the U.S. market AMC-built counterparts. Engines {{were the same}} as the year before with a one-barrel 145hp 232 as standard on the sedans and automatic wagon and the two-barrel 155hp version for the manual wagon. All featured a front sway bar as standard equipment. The 1972 models also included a new plastic grille with a revised hood latch, along with a new tail light design with larger backup lights, a new optional <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> design, a third AM radio model (shared with the VAM Javelin), and new interior door panels with a wood imitation rectangular portion. This was also {{the first year of the}} seatbelt warning buzzer located above the light and wiper knobs. The Camioneta Rambler American featured the Chrysler-built TorqueFlite A904 automatic transmission, replacing the previous Borg-Warner [...] "Shift-Command" [...] units.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} novelty for 1981 was {{the introduction}} of a third trim level within the VAM's Rally line, the company's first high-end luxury sporty model called Rally SST. This version carried the same mechanicals as the Rally AMX except that it came equipped from the factory with the three-speed automatic transmission. Appearance wise, the car carried bright trim on the rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails, B-pillar molding plus door and side glass bases. The moldings for the windshield and rear glass were also bright instead of blacked out while both bumpers were chromed. The lower portions of the sides, doors and front fenders carried wide moldings with a horizontal six-stripe pattern. The in-house five-spoke wheels held AMC's [...] "Noryl" [...] <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> design. Finally, chromed squared mirrors with inside controls were fitted to the doors. The Rally SST is the closest VAM counterpart to the AMC Spirits in terms of appearance and the Mexican equivalent of the US AMC Spirit Limited model. To reduce the sportiness and enforce the luxury appointments of the line, a fender-mounted electric antenna was made standard equipment so the AMX's sporty roof-mounted diagonal design would not be present. For this same reason, the rear spoiler was not available. Among its unique characteristics, the Rally SST included side armrest safety reflectors and sun visor lighted vanity mirror from the factory, which were unavailable in the AMXs and GTs. The interior of the Rally SST was the same as the one of the GTs and AMXs with the only exceptions of the center console having an open compartment in place of the auxiliary gauges and the quartz electric digital clock instead of both tachometer types. Despite the luxury focus, the sporty aspects were retained {{in the form of the}} individual reclining Recaro-type bucket seats, center console with armrest and rear ashtray, floor-mounted transmission, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel and the full suspension package with rear sway bar.|$|E
50|$|The SXT {{is a step}} up {{from the}} base SE model, adding seventeen-inch steel wheels with full <b>wheel</b> <b>covers,</b> air conditioning, six speakers, and keyless entry. In 2014, the SXT got new <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> and {{optional}} sixteen-inch alloy wheels. The Rallye trim was a distinct model but is now available as a package that {{can be added to}} the SXT trim.|$|R

5000|$|A spare <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> or {{spare tire}} cover is an {{accessory}} {{that covers the}} spare wheel mounted on external part of a car or van.
