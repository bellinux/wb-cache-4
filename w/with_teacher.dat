He attended Forest Avenue High School, where he studied debate as well as English <b>with</b> <b>teacher</b> Myra Brown, whom he later credited with much of his early interest in books. He began his university studies at Amherst College, but when traditions preventing Jews from joining clubs or fraternities drastically curtailed his social life, he transferred to Harvard University after the first year.

25|$|After 1968, when Bolte turned 60, {{his appeal}} to younger urban voters declined, {{and he showed}} little sympathy with new {{issues such as the}} {{environment}} and civil liberties. His standing was also reduced by a crisis in the state education system, <b>with</b> <b>teacher</b> shortages and overcrowded schools as the children of the baby boom passed through the education system. The government recruited large numbers of American schoolteachers to deal with the shortage. At the same time the Labor Party began to revive under a new leader, Clyde Holding.|$|E

25|$|Students {{with special}} needs {{struggle}} not only with writing and reading acquisition, but with social and emotional development and confidence about their writing. Dialogue journals as an individualized means of private, mutual communication can provide students with support in handling emotions, conflicts, and frustrations. For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the opportunity to express ideas and thoughts <b>with</b> <b>teacher</b> elaboration and modeling, and without correction, {{has been shown to}} increase their time on task, writing length, and writing quality. Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E

Rantaro is sent by {{his father and mother}} (Shido Nakamura and Rei Dan) to attend the six-year course at a Ninja Academy run by Denzo Yamada (Susumu Terajima). Rantaro's {{homeroom}} teacher is Hansuke Doi (Takahiro Miura) and head of the Ninja Girl classes at the school is Shina Yamamoto who appears as either a beautiful young woman (Anne Watanabe) or an older woman (Tamao Nakamura). After going home to his parents' farm for the holidays, Rantaro is joined by his schoolmate Shinbei (Futa Kimura) but they later decided to stay <b>with</b> <b>teacher</b> Doi. One day, some Usetake ninjas arrive at the house of flamboyant hairdresser Yukitaka Saito (Takeshi Kaga) and his son Takamaru (Takuya Mizoguchi) in order to kill both of them. Yukitaka and Takamura used to belong to the Usetake clan, but Rantaro and his friends aim to save them by joining a contest that ends with a race to ring a bell on top of a mountain.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the unique and joint effects of peer victimization and conflicts <b>with</b> <b>teachers</b> on student behavioral and affective engagement across the school year among a sample of 333 fifth- and sixth-grade students. Results first showed that peer victimization {{was not a significant}} predictor of students’ affective engagement, whereas conflicts <b>with</b> <b>teachers</b> were negatively associated with this outcome, but for girls only. Moreover, experiencing contentious relationships <b>with</b> <b>teachers</b> did not play a moderating role in the association between victimization and the affective dimension of engagement. However, conflictual relationships <b>with</b> <b>teachers</b> did moderate the link between boys’ victimization and the behavioral dimension of engagement such that greater behavioral adjustment was evidenced by boys who had low levels of peer victimization only if they also reported low levels of conflict <b>with</b> the <b>teacher.</b> Sensitizing teachers to this reality and encouraging them to modify their demeanor with vulnerable children who pass under their radar remains a productive focus of intervention...|$|R

2500|$|The {{animated}} {{version of}} Peanuts differs {{in some aspects}} from the strip. In the strip, adult voices are heard, though conversations are usually only depicted from the children's end. To translate this aspect to the animated medium, {{the sound of a}} trombone with a solotone mute (created by Vince Guaraldi [...] played by Dean Hubbard [...] ) was used to simulate adult [...] "voices." [...] A more significant deviation from the strip was the treatment of Snoopy. In the strip, the dog's thoughts are verbalized in thought balloons; in animation, he is typically mute, his thoughts communicated through growls or laughs (voiced by Bill Meléndez), and pantomime, or by having human characters verbalizing his thoughts for him. These treatments have both been abandoned temporarily in the past. For example, they experimented <b>with</b> <b>teacher</b> dialogue in She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown. The elimination of Snoopy's [...] "voice" [...] is probably the most controversial aspect of the adaptations, but Schulz apparently approved of the treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Young Katherine both {{drew and}} wrote as hobbies, but her first formal {{training}} in painting was at the Corcoran Art School in Washington, D.C., in 1919–1920. After {{she and her mother}} went back to Italy in 1920, she studied art in Rome for several years, learning conventional techniques and styles. She particularly enjoyed painting outdoors in the Roman Campagna <b>with</b> <b>teacher</b> Oronato Carlandi and fellow students. Much later, Sage stated that “these were the happiest days of my life”, and she told friend and gallery owner Julien Levy in 1961 that her campagna experience shaped her “perspective idea of distance and going away.” [...] Nonetheless, in later years Sage usually claimed that she was self-taught, perhaps because, as one of her biographers, Judith Suther, states, most of what she had learned in Rome bore so little relationship to the kind of painting she eventually did that “she felt as if she had studied with no one.” ...|$|E
