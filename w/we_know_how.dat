500|$|Although the British Hurricane {{device was}} more {{advanced}} than the American Fat Man bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology, and while British and Soviet advances had taken much of the heat out of American opposition to renewed cooperation with the British, the United States Congress saw little benefit {{in it for the}} United States. The McMahon Act was amended by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations, on 30 August 1954, but it fell far short of what the British government wanted. Churchill, who had replaced Attlee as prime minister, turned to Lord Cherwell for advice on the prospect of producing a British hydrogen bomb. Cherwell reported that [...] "We think <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to make an H-bomb", but Penney did not agree with this sanguine assessment.|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> {{to play the}} songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already {{know how to play}} our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E

His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much you like American voices.

500|$|Most {{commentators}} blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; {{one analyst}} {{stated that the}} company's troubles were more [...] "company-specific than market-driven", and another declared company CEO Paul Eibeler to be the [...] "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to [...] "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" [...] as evidence of his failure. Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and Todd Howard, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005. They planned to give updates every subsequent weekend until the game's release. A commentator from Joystiq complained of the vagueness of the updates: [...] "they don't get any more specific than to say, 'There is work that {{still needs to be}} done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> hard they are working....While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game." ...|$|E

[...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy agreed, saying that the song was [...] "nothing less than was expected." [...] He awarded the song four out of five stars, saying that the song could not top [...] "Commander" [...] but [...] "comes pretty close." [...] It [...] " [...] beats that bounce faster than a chesty lady on a high-powered jetski. It all makes for another infectious club-pop number on which Kel is refreshingly direct with her fella." [...] Not all reviews were positive. Rick Fullton of the Daily Record was much less impressed with the song, saying it could have [...] "been a session singer" [...] instead of the [...] "dance diva" [...] Rowland is intending on becoming. A reviewer from StarObserver praised the dance remix of the song. The review said, [...] "French DJ Antoine Clamaran has turned K Row’s mid-tempo jam into the perfect summer anthem – with killer beats, an uplifting chorus and suitably cheesy video (below)." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The song has regarded as a re-invention of [...] "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" [...] and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, the song alters {{the format of the}} former, rearranging the song's overall structure while adding a chorus. [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is led by a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] string section that has been compared to Coldplay's [...] "Viva la Vida". Mark Hall felt that the band's arrangement brought out the message of one of the song's final verses ("God our Father/Christ our brother/all who live in love are thine/teach us how to love each other/and fill us to the joy divine"); Hall described the message by saying [...] "God's our father and Christ's our brother, we have this connection with God. But if we can't love each other, the joy isn't completed. Its not real joy yet until <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to love the people that are around us".|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Rings of Ahkaten" [...] {{was held}} on 17 October 2012, with filming beginning the next week on 22 October. Director Farren Blackburn had previously worked on the programme in the 2011 Christmas special [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe". According to Matt Smith, there were [...] "between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens" [...] in a scene set in an alien market. The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick-ups or reshoots for [...] "Nightmare in Silver". Millennium FX's Neill Gorton remarked that he had [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} scene like the Star Wars cantina" [...] and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future, as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget. Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources. For example, Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson called him and asked, [...] "We've always wanted to have a speeder-bike like in Return of the Jedi and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to do it inexpensively, so can you get one into the story?" [...] However, Cross felt that the speeder-bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon. The songs were written by composer Murray Gold. To help establish the year {{at the beginning of the}} episode [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials is heard and the Doctor is seen reading a 1981 copy of The Beano. The issue of The Beano was reprinted and included in a special Doctor Who-themed edition on 15 May 2013.|$|E

"Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
