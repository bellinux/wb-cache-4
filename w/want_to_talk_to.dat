5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E

According to The Daily Yomiuri, [...] "This was one of Junko Sakurada's last starring roles before she fell out of favor with the public. Since she {{took part in the}} Rev.

500|$|Schur {{said the}} writing staff had {{difficulty}} scripting {{the scene where}} Ann kisses Andy: [...] "We {{had a lot of}} discussions about this because we didn't want Ann to be too much of a jerk and kiss a guy who likes another girl, and we didn't want Andy to be too much of a jerk because he likes April. It was very delicate." [...] The episode marked a turning point for the romantic subplot between April and Andy, who shared their first kiss of the series in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti". Goor said filming of that scene, [...] "They nailed the kiss immediately." [...] While trying to get April to talk to him, Andy pretends he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her at all, which he incorrectly calls [...] "reverse psychiatry" [...] instead of reverse psychology. This line was improvised by Chris Pratt.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "original" [...] or [...] "unique" [...] and praised its script's range of emotions and humor. IGN's Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle. He found the game both [...] "bizarre and memorable". Official Nintendo Magazine Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as [...] "one of the medium's strongest and idiosyncratic storylines" [...] that fluctuated [...] "between humorous and poignant". GameZone David Sanchez thought its script was [...] "clever" [...] and [...] "sharp", as it displayed {{a wide range of}} emotions that made him <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> all non-player characters. GamesTM wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its [...] "strangely existential narrative framework".|$|E
500|$|On July 10, CNN News host Anderson Cooper {{interviewed the}} National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's co-founder and former emcee of America's Most Wanted, John Walsh about the case. Walsh stated that [...] "absolutely someone knows" [...] the {{identity}} of the Jane Doe and that in similar cases, it was often the [...] "live-in boyfriend" [...] or the mother of the child that had abused or neglected one of several children in a family, citing that the victim could have been [...] "accidentally killed or starved to death." [...] When explaining a probable reason why the girl had remained unidentified, Walsh stated that [...] "people do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> cops," [...] possibly due to the fear of authorities investigating their own lives. For instance, the family of Anjelica Castillo, who were undocumented immigrants and never reported the victim missing due to fear of deportation. Walsh encouraged viewers to contact him instead, giving the number for the show he hosts, The Hunt With John Walsh and the URL for his profile on the CNN website. He confirmed that those submitting tips could remain anonymous.|$|E

500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at any time {{that he wanted to}} rely on his right to remain silent, nor that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequence—did he believe in God, did he pray to God, and did he pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction.|$|E
500|$|Part of the game's {{inspiration}} {{came from}} the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to music videos, thus allowing Brütal Legend to [...] "fulfill the promise" [...] of such lore. Schafer also credits a Megadeth roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him. Schafer had previously explored {{the idea of a}} roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from Day of the Tentacle, but Brütal Legend represented an opportunity to expand on it further. The 2003 movie School of Rock also reminded Schafer of his idea for Brütal Legend, and made him more excited to publish it. [...] Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for Brütal Legends creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting Brütal Legend to Psychonauts. Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of Brütal Legend, such as [...] "hot babes and Jack Black", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of Brütal Legend, as despite poor sales of Psychonauts, [...] "as long as you make a cool game, publishers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you". When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback about changing the game's style to hip hop or country. He credits Harmonix Music Systems for influencing the rhythm game market through the release of the widely successful Guitar Hero with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of Guitar Hero, the metal approach in Brütal Legend was readily accepted.|$|E
