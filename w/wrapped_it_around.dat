5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> {{his fist and}} attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
25|$|The {{drinking}} straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually {{a drink from}} one location to another. The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from its}} {{original}} purpose as an electrical insulating tape, a common use for friction tape is to <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the blade of a hockey stick to improve puck control. Another use is to <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the handle of a softball or baseball bat to provide a better grip. It is also useful as a base when wrapping a bicycle handlebar with handlebar tape.|$|R
5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold <b>it.</b> Some <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the forearm seven times, while others <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the upper arm an additional time before <b>wrapping</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|R

25|$|The next {{match was}} for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers) defended the titles against Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). Midnight Express's manager Jim Cornette was locked and {{suspended}} high in a steel cage and fastened in a straight jacket. The match stipulated that if Fantastics won, they would {{get the opportunity to}} whip Cornette ten times with a belt. Cornette tried to involve himself into the match on several occasions but failed. The match went back and forth with the challengers double teaming Fulton. Rogers was tagged in and he battled Eaton and Lane. Lane handed Eaton a steel chain and Eaton <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> his fist. Fulton was unaware of it which allowed Eaton to attack Fulton with the chain and pin him to win the titles.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1955, Hensley began {{a series}} of {{meetings}} near Altha, Florida. He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks, before procuring a [...] snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24. Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith shop for the observance. During the service, Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith. He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored, <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> his neck, and rubbed it on his face. He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can. As he placed the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. After a few minutes, Hensley became visibly ill, experiencing severe pain, a discolored arm, and hematemesis. He refused medical attention, although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the Calhoun County Sheriff. One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation's lack of faith, although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God. Hensley died early the next morning. Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide.|$|E
500|$|On November 27, 1989, {{the trial}} {{commenced}} under District Judge David Roth after Taylor waived {{his right to}} a jury. Taylor testified {{on his own behalf}} that he only entered the apartment in the act of burglary while no one was home, leaving his fingerprints on the phone when he found money underneath it. Weber County deputy attorney William Daines stated that Taylor previously denied being in the apartment and that two witnesses placed him at the scene {{at the time of the}} crime. Prison inmate Mike Gallegos testified that he had a brief conversation in which Taylor told him that he killed a girl by accident, and masturbated on the corpse. [...] Duane Moyes and James Gaskill of the Weber State College crime laboratory testified that the person who cut the telephone cord with a knife and <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the neck of the victim was likely the same as the one who left behind fingerprints on the phone. Lab director Gaskill stated that the prints, three of which were matched to fingers on Taylor's left hand, were the only evidence that placed Taylor at the crime scene. Gaskill said there was no evidence in the apartment to indicate a burglary took place or that any other person was connected to the murder.|$|E

50|$|Kidan habesha (alt. ije tebab) {{is a white}} {{handmade}} clothing. It comprises a {{white shirt}} and pants. Then a thin, gauze-like, fabric is wrapped around the shoulders and chest. Sometimes, men take the extra material and <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> their waist making a skirt on top of their pants, then <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> their shoulders. This kind of clothing is worn with intricately designed stick and white shoes. It is mostly worn at weddings and cultural events.|$|R

500|$|Cage had {{his first}} title defense against Brown on March 12, 2006 at TNA's Destination X PPV event; there Cage {{defeated}} Brown to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On the March 25 and April 2 respective Impact! episodes, Abyss, his manager Father James Mitchell, and Alex Shelley showed two pre-taped video packages that had been compiled {{in the weeks before}} the episodes. The first, on March 25, depicted Mitchell stalking Cage's wife Denise, confronting her, and even threatening that [...] "they were coming". The second aired on April 2, with Abyss, accompanied by Mitchell and Shelley, who was taping the segment with a camcorder like the previous video package, attacking Cage at his home in Tampa, Florida and nearly drowning Cage in his own pool. This storyline led to Cage facing Abyss at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April 23, 2006 in a Six Sides of Steel cage match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, with Cage prevailing. After the match, Cage attempted to attack Mitchell and gain revenge for all his recent evil deeds against Cage and his family. Abyss, however, stopped him, took a steel chain, <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> Cage's neck, and attempted to hang him with it until he passed out. Abyss and Mitchell then stole the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt and left the arena. The storyline between Abyss and Mitchell and Cage continued until TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 14, 2006, where Cage defeated Abyss and regained the NWA title belt under Full Metal Mayhem rules.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sergeant Miller, [...] "We {{continued}} {{to treat the}} patients, continued moving ammunition and grenades {{to where they were}} needed. I grabbed a radio … and set up satellite communication and then returned to the rear." [...] Tech Sergeant Miller and Senior Airman Jason Cunningham, like Miller, a pararescueman, worked hard to keep the patients from succumbing to hypothermia. They put them in the helicopter and removed its insulation and <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the wounded Rangers. In addition, they used the majority of the fluids available in the medical kits and anything else, including the heaters packed in their food rations. With the help of the additional Rangers and more air strikes, they took the hill, killing many al Qaeda combatants. They also recovered the bodies of Petty Officer Roberts and Sergeant Chapman.|$|E

Then he went on through the woods in the starlight; and he felt so happy and light of heart that he {{sometimes}} frisked and capered about just as a real moose would do. And {{he was doing this}} when Shuben, who was also out hunting, saw him from afar and thought he was a real moose. She stole cautiously through the woods until she came to the brink of a little valley. Below her stood the snow white moose. She drew her arrow to her eye--alas, she knew the art only too well!--and took careful aim. The next moment Accadee fell dead with her arrow in his heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Quest did {{not wait}} for another word. He jumped a rough bush of scrub on the {{right-hand}} side, galloped over the ground, which was already hot with the coming fire, and followed along down the road by which Lenora had passed. When {{he came to the}} first bend, he could hear the roar of flames in the trees. A volume of smoke almost blinded him; his horse became wholly unmanageable. He slipped from the saddle and ran on, staggering from right to left like a drunken man. About forty yards along the road, Lenora was lying in the dust. A volume of smoke rushed over her. The tree under which she had collapsed was already afire. A twig fell from it as Quest staggered up, and her skirt began to smoulder. He tore off his coat, <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> her, beat out the fire which was already blazing at her feet, and snatched her into his arms. She opened her eyes for a moment.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{feature of}} NT {{cassettes}} is Non-Loading, which means {{instead of having}} a mechanism to pull the tape out of the cassette and <b>wrap</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the drum, the drum is pushed inside the cassette {{to achieve the same}} effect.

6000|$|There {{was some}} quiet, but rapid, mavoeuvring at Bellemeade during the {{ensuring}} half hour, {{which ended in}} five disgusted and sullen tramps being captured, and locked securely in an outhouse pending {{the coming of the}} morning and retribution. For another result, the visiting young gentlemen had secured the unqualified worship of the visiting young ladies by their distinguished and heroic conduct. For still another, behold Whistling Dick, the hero, seated at the planter's table, feasting upon viands his experience had never before included, and waited upon by admiring femininity in shapes of such beauty and [...] "swellness" [...] that even his ever-full mouth could scarcely prevent him from whistling. He was made to disclose in detail his adventure with the evil gang of Boston Harry, and how he cunningly wrote the note and <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> the stone and placed it at the toe of the stocking, and, watching his chance, sent it silently, with a wonderful centrifugal momentum, like a comet, at one of the big lighted windows of the dining-room.|$|E
60|$|The beeswax is a {{still more}} {{important}} and valuable product, {{formed by the}} wild bees (Apis dorsata), which build huge honeycombs, suspended {{in the open air}} from the underside of the lofty branches of the highest trees. These are of a semicircular form, and often three or four feet in diameter. I once saw the natives take a bees' nest, and a very interesting sight it was. In the valley where I used to collect insects, I one day saw three or four Timorese men and boys under a high tree, and, looking up, saw on a very lofty horizontal branch three large bees' combs. The tree was straight and smooth-barked and without a branch, until at seventy or eighty feet from the ground it gave out the limb which the bees had chosen for their home. As the men were evidently looking after the bees, I waited to watch their operations. One of them first produced a long piece of wood apparently the stem of a small tree or creeper, which he had brought with him, and began splitting it through in several directions, which showed that it was very tough and stringy. He then wrapped it in palm-leaves, which were secured by twisting a slender creeper round them. He then fastened his cloth tightly round his loins, and producing another cloth <b>wrapped</b> <b>it</b> <b>around</b> his head, neck, and body, and tied it firmly around his neck, leaving his face, arms, and legs completely bare. Slung to his girdle he carried a long thin coil of cord; and while he had been making these preparations, one of his companions had cut a strong creeper or bush-rope eight or ten yards long, to one end of which the wood-torch was fastened, and lighted at the bottom, emitting a steady stream of smoke. Just above the torch a chopping-knife was fastened by a short cord.|$|E
