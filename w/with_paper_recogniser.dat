40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a computerized procedure system, the Computerized Procedure Manual II (COPMA-II), on the performance and mental workload of licensed reactor operators. To evaluate COPMA-II, eight teams of two operators were trained to operate a scaled pressurized water reactor facility (SPWRF) <b>with</b> traditional <b>paper</b> procedures and <b>with</b> COPMA-II. Following training, each team operated the SPWRF under normal operating conditions <b>with</b> both <b>paper</b> procedures and COPMA-II. The teams then performed one of two accident scenarios <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> procedures, but performed the remaining accident scenario with COPMA-II. Performance measures and subjective estimates of mental workload were recorded for each performance trial. The most important finding of the study was that the operators committed only half as many errors during the accident scenarios with COPMA-II as they committed <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> procedures. However, time to initiate a procedure was fastest for paper procedures for accident scenario trials. For performance under normal operating conditions, there was no difference in time to initiate or to complete a procedure, or in the number of errors committed <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> procedures and <b>with</b> COPMA-II. There were no consistent differences in the mental workload ratings operators recorded for trials <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> procedures and COPMA-II...|$|R
