One of the main research directions for <b>well</b> <b>test</b> soft technology was specific interpretation theory and interpretation techniques. In recent years, <b>well</b> <b>test</b> was put forward higher request by the production complex and low permeability reservoirs. Test interpretation results urgently need {{to be applied to}} reservoir engineering analysis in-depth and quantitatively. One of the limited reality conditions of <b>well</b> <b>test</b> application was lack of the comprehensive research combined with the reservoir engineering. Combining with the test examples, the investigation radius change between injection-production wells was studied, and the build-up <b>well</b> <b>test</b> cycle in low permeability reservoir was optimized. According to the actual process situation, it was proposed that take 20 d as the upper limit of <b>well</b> <b>test</b> cycle, and 10 d block as the lower limit of <b>well</b> <b>test</b> cycle of build-up <b>well</b> <b>test</b> in a typical low permeability reservoir...|$|R

As for tight oil reservoirs, <b>well</b> <b>test</b> needs very accurate pressure data from transient pressure tests which is time-consuming due to the very low pressure conductivity in tight layers. MPA has been widely adopted to accomplish production performance analysis to obtain useful reservoir parameters and OOIPSRV.|$|R
2500|$|Aquifer testing {{differs from}} <b>well</b> <b>testing</b> {{in that the}} {{behaviour}} of the well is primarily of concern in the latter, while {{the characteristics of the}} aquifer are quantified in the former. [...] Aquifer testing also often utilizes one or more monitoring wells, or piezometers ("point" [...] observation wells). [...] A monitoring well is simply a well which is not being pumped (but is used to monitor the hydraulic head in the aquifer). Typically monitoring and pumping wells are screened across the same aquifers.|$|E
