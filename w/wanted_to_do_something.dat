5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different. Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
5|$|We really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> {{that just}} shows who I am. We weren't {{trying to make}} a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the {{mistakes}} were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

25|$|All Time Low {{signed with}} Hopeless Records in March 2006 and {{released}} the Put Up or Shut Up EP in July of that year. The band's second album, So Wrong, It's Right, {{was released in}} September 2007. They began writing for their third album between tours. In February 2008, {{it was reported that}} All Time Low had collaborated on a song with Mark Hoppus of Blink-182/+44. The band connected with Hoppus after exchanging emails when a video of drummer Rian Dawson getting a Blink-182 tattoo was posted online. Hoppus' management contacted the band saying he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with the group, so they co-wrote a song with him.|$|E

25|$|Lynn Townsend was at {{odds with}} the Dodge Dealers and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to please them. So in 1965 he asked me to come to his office - for the second time. He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council {{requests}} was for a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme was the same - we want what Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a derivative of the Barracuda': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{band played}} a second show in Gothenburg. Döring and Dimeo had quit the band {{since the first}} show, so Opeth {{contacted}} {{two members of the}} band Crimson Cat, Kim Pettersson and Johan DeFarfalla, and asked them to join them onstage. Other bands playing the show were At the Gates, Therion, Desecrator, Megaslaughter and Sarcazm. After the show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend. He was replaced by Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren, who was playing in a joke band called Sylt i krysset. He accepted the offer to play bass in Opeth because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> more serious. Pettersson later left the band, and Lindgren switched to guitar. Isberg quit in 1992, due to creative differences. Åkerfeldt became the new vocalist. He and Lindgren started writing material immediately. They rehearsed as a 3-piece for more than a year. Stefan Guteklint joined on bass, but left soon after the band signed its first record deal with Candlelight Records, in 1994.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox.

I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

25|$|The {{park was}} created in 1978 when Great American Recreation (GAR), the new owners of the {{recently}} combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with the ski area during the off season. Two years earlier, in 1976, they had followed the trend of many other ski areas {{at the time and}} opened a -long alpine slide down very steep ski trails. Gradually, Waterworld and Motorworld came together {{at the base of the}} mountain to form one of North America's earliest modern water parks, which was originally called the Vernon Valley Summer Park. They started out with two water slides and a LOLA race car track in the summer of 1978, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year, as well as tennis courts and a softball field. Finally, Motorworld was carved out of the swampy areas the ski area owned across Route 94. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 1880, on his {{way from}} London to Switzerland, Gordon had visited King Leopold II of Belgium in Brussels and was invited {{to take charge of}} the Congo Free State. Leopold tried very hard to {{convince}} Gordon to enter his service, not least because Gordon was known to be modest in his salary demands, unlike Leopold's current agent in the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley, who received a monthly salary of 300,000 Belgian francs. Gordon rejected Leopold's offers, partly because he was still emotionally attached to the Sudan and partly because he disliked the idea of working for Leopold's Congo Association, which was a private company owned by the King. In April, the government of the Cape Colony offered him the position of commandant of the Cape local forces, which Gordon declined. A deeply depressed Gordon wrote in his letter declining the offer that he knew, for reasons that he refused to explain, that he had only ten years left to live, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> great and grand in his last ten years.|$|E
