Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E
500|$|Like its predecessor, {{the second}} {{deputation}} went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 Exposition Universelle was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air balloon {{for the first}} time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. [...] "High up in mid-air", he recalled, [...] "I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> so far, to take me all the way home." [...] The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal [...] "to remind me of my journey through the air". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.|$|E

The Times wrote: [...] "The humblest of people {{felt that they}} had the kinship of nature with a Princess who was the model of family virtue as a daughter, a sister, a wife and a mother...Her {{abundant}} sympathies sought for objects of help in the great unknown waste of human distress". The Illustrated London News wrote that the [...] "lesson of the late Princess's life is as noble as it is obvious. Moral worth is far more important than high position". The death was also heavily felt by the royal family, especially by Alice's brother and sister-in-law, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Princess of Wales, upon meeting the Queen after Alice's death, exclaimed [...] "I wish I had died instead of her". The Prince, meanwhile, wrote to the Earl of Granville that Alice [...] "was my favourite sister. So good, so kind, so clever! <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> through so much together..." ...|$|E

40|$|The last half-century {{has seen}} {{tremendous}} progress in computing, genetics, and clinical care. In computing <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> from the ENIAC in 1946 [1] to {{the explosion of}} the World Wide Web in 1996 to the Internet becoming {{part of the fabric of}} society today. In genetics <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> from the elucidation of DNA as the mechanism of inheritance in 1953 [2] to the sequencing of the human genome completed in 2003 [3]. In clinical care <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> from the first published randomized clinical trial in 1948 [4] to ever-increasing adoption of evidence based medicine [5]. The convergence of these domains brings with it the promise of genomic medicine [6] with personalized, preventive, and predictive healthcare [7]. Biomedical informatics has a long tradition of being involved with key aspects of this convergence. Bioinformatic...|$|R
500|$|Professor Lamine (KUL), {{a former}} Vlaams Blok member and [...] "advisor" [...] of the party's legal team, {{claimed that the}} party, for {{propaganda}} reasons, purposely undertook a weak defence, in order to lose the case; [...] "For the party leaders, losing was much more interesting. Winning just wasn't an option." [...] Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to Strasbourg [...] based on procedural arguments, we {{might have had a}} case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments. If Vlaams Belang were to put forth a claim against the verdict as well, at Strasbourg, the Court will bundle both cases. Then we would lose the case for sure. Lamine has thus given us the final blow." ...|$|E
500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E

Raine had just gotten back from Sudan, he was trying to compress all the things he’d experienced.

2500|$|Bret Harris, {{author of}} Ella, Ella, Ella, criticised Campese's {{positional}} play at full-back, and praised New Zealand's backs, in particular All Black centre Steve Pokere, for their tactical kicking. In My Game Your Game Campese defended his 'general play', but highlighted this Test as his 'first bitter experience' playing rugby union at Test match level: [...] "My first bitter experience was in 1983, {{when we played}} the All Blacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a one-off Bledisloe Cup game. My general play was fine, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> into the game without a recognised goal-kicker. Our regular fullback Roger Gould was injured and yours truly was given the job. None out of four was the end result and the All Blacks won the Test 18–8, despite Australia scoring two tries to one. The press {{had a great time}} with that one." ...|$|E
