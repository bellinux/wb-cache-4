5|$|Thatcher {{returned}} to the backbenches as a constituency parliamentarian after leaving the premiership. Her domestic approval rating recovered after her resignation; the balance of public opinion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> government had been good for the country. Aged 66, she retired from the House at the 1992 general election, saying that leaving the Commons would allow her more freedom to speak her mind.|$|E
5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for {{eighteen}} months while city and fire department officials {{decided whether to}} replace her {{at a cost of}} $225,000 dollars or rebuild her for $99,000 dollars, which was $8,000 dollars more than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E
25|$|To {{cope with}} a mortal injury she {{sustained}} in a mission, Mockingbird was injected with an experimental serum combining the Super Soldier Serum that gave Captain America his strength and the Infinity Formula that has slowed Nick Fury's aging. The obvious consequence of this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> injuries were healed, but Fury admitted his uncertainty about the formula's long-term consequences on her biology. Thus far, she has exhibited greatly enhanced physical strength, healing and agility.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to this bill, the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, announced a community consultation process, which resulted in over 74,000 respondents participating, 64 percent of whom voted in favour of a trial, and 63 percent of whom were in favour of holding a referendum. The decision announced by the Premier on 7 June 2010 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> Government would not support the bill because rural Queenslanders were overwhelmingly opposed to DST. The Bill was defeated in Queensland Parliament on 15 June 2011.|$|E

25|$|Despite listing 12 grapplers {{that she}} would work with, Wolfe used his {{influence}} to get her frozen from NWA members. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> run in the Southeast with Cowboy Luttrall and Paul Jones in 1954 fizzled. Adding insult to injury, Burke wrestled Wolfe’s daughter-in-law June Byers. The match took place on August 20, 1954 in Atlanta and the match was a shoot. By having the local commission in his corner, Wolfe slid a friendly referee into the match. Despite giving up the first fall {{with the intention of}} competing stronger in the second, Burke never had the opportunity. Officials called the match, and the second fall never had a finish.|$|E
25|$|Vesta's {{farewell}} tour {{took a year}} {{to complete}} between 1919 and 1920. All proceeds were given to a local children's charity {{in the city where}} the performances took place, with a guarantee of £500 per city, Tilley making up the difference if necessary. She made her final appearance at the Coliseum Theatre, London, at the age of 56. When she gave up the stage, {{one of the main reasons}} she gave <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband wanted to become an MP, and her profession was not really respectable enough for such a milieu; arguably, she was too well known and outshone him as a public figure, which was a concern. For the rest of her life she lived as Lady de Frece, moving to Monte Carlo with her husband upon his retirement from politics.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} about the 2001 cancellation of Xena Warrior Princess, Lawless was approached by the producers of The X-Files for {{a spot on the}} show. According to Lawless, one reason why she made an appearance on the show <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> daughter was a [...] "mad X-Files fan". She further commented that she knew about the show and based her character Xena on Fox Mulder.|$|E
500|$|Grace Lee Whitney was {{released}} {{during the filming}} of the first season. The official reason given for Whitney's departure from the show <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> character limited romantic possibilities for Captain Kirk. This idea was supported by Whitney, saying [...] "They didn't {{want to give the}} fans the idea [...] was in love with Janice Rand. That would limit him. They wanted him to go out and fool around. So, I was axed." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2015 UCI Road World Championships in Richmond, United States, she won {{the silver}} medal with her team in the team time trial. In the [...] time trial she {{finished}} disappointingly seventh. A reason for her performance <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> rear wheal was not well attached in the frame. Her wheel ran into the frame, damaging her tire and puncturing her inner tube. For the road race she rode for Anna van der Breggen who won the silver medal and finished in tenth place herself.|$|E

500|$|Dr Petter Andreas Steen, {{professor}} at the National Hospital in Oslo, said it was [...] "an extraordinary medical achievement" [...] that Bågenholm's life could be saved. He believed the reason {{she was able to}} recover <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> metabolism slowed down during the incident and the tissues inside her body required less oxygen at the low temperatures. According to the journal Proto (published by the Massachusetts General Hospital), Bågenholm's metabolism slowed down to ten percent of its baseline rate and thus she barely needed any oxygen at all.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth's [...] "commandment" [...] <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{emissary}} {{read out}} her letters of disapproval publicly before the Dutch Council of State, Leicester having to stand nearby. This public humiliation of her [...] "Lieutenant-General" [...] combined with her continued talks {{for a separate}} peace with Spain, irreversibly undermined his standing among the Dutch. The military campaign was severely hampered by Elizabeth's repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. Her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, Leicester's own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the faction-ridden and chaotic situation of Dutch politics led {{to the failure of}} the campaign. Leicester finally resigned his command in December 1587.|$|E
500|$|Tim Teeman and James Jackson from The Times named Daphne's {{death as}} one of their top 15 most memorable Neighbours moments. They commented [...] "Like, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> in the bed or an actress with a Daphne wig? The romance of Des and Daphne (Mr Ordinary and the ex-stripper) was an early Neighbours classic so we felt this one hard". A Herald Sun {{reporter}} also included Daphne's death in their list of top ten Neighbours moments. The reporter wrote that Daphne was a popular character during the serial's peak in 1988 and called Des [...] "her soulmate". They added that her death was watched by millions of viewers in Australia and the UK.|$|E

500|$|Despite their organic appearance, Oliver's {{own view}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> work was not {{grounded}} in nature's structures. [...] Nevertheless, critics {{have identified the}} lifelike qualities of early pieces that resembled shells, claws or tails, or noted the apparent similarities to biological forms. McDonald commented that [...] "For Oliver to deny nature is akin to Balthus saying there is nothing erotic about his paintings or Rothko claiming his works aren't abstract." [...] Both major reviews of Oliver's work (Fenner's 1995 essay and Fink's 2002 journal article) draw attention to dualism and contradiction in the sculptures: Fenner describes them as [...] "delicate and ephemeral, [...] structurally robust and durable"; Fink sees them as [...] "ethereal but solid, fluid yet rigid, open but closed".|$|E
500|$|As the Metafilter thread progressed, users {{discovered}} that Kaycee's CollegeClub account {{was tied to}} the CollegeClub account of Debbie Swenson's teenaged daughter, and that records showed that someone had logged into Kaycee's account days after {{she was supposed to}} have died. A user investigated the photographs that Kaycee had shared on her blog, identified a school mascot pictured, and traced it back to a particular high school, then traced the jersey number that [...] "Kaycee" [...] was wearing to an actual player. Investigation of the player showed that the only connection she had to Kaycee Nicole <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> family had once been acquainted with the Swenson family; she was not ill, was not named Kaycee Nicole, and not aware that her photo was being used by someone else.|$|E
500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> role required her to drive: {{at the time}} she {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I’m really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy to do it because the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E
