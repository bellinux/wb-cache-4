500|$|Ruby Messer Barber {{had this}} to say about joining the WAVES, [...] "It was a choice of adventure. I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's {{something}} I can do, one way I can make a contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E
500|$|When Dylan played Shelton the song, {{shortly after}} {{recording}} it, he claimed, [...] "This {{is the best}} song I've ever written." [...] Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel, [...] "Just listen to that! That's old-time religious carnival music!" [...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I just sat down at a table and started writing... And I just got carried away with the whole thing... I just started writing and I couldn't stop. After a period of time, I forgot <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about, and I started {{trying to get back}} to the beginning [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|England's next match pitted {{them against}} the United States—an {{opponent}} {{they were expected to}} easily overcome—at the Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte, [...] inland. The selectors again picked Ramsey, but left star winger Stanley Matthews out on the grounds that England could beat the Americans without him, ignoring Winterbottom's protests. England dominated the first half. [...] "I'm not making excuses when I say that in the first 45 minutes we had a year's bad luck," [...] Ramsey wrote in 1952. [...] "Shots which appeared certain to score missed by the width of a coat of paint. The American goalkeeper, much to his astonishment, found himself stopping the ball with his body, and on occasions his face, without really knowing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about." [...] The US grabbed a shock lead on 37 minutes when a long shot towards England's penalty area flew into the net off the head of American forward Joe Gaetjens.|$|E

500|$|On {{the vinyl}} and {{cassette}} pressings of Illmatic, Nas replaces the traditional Side A and Side B division with [...] "40th Side North" [...] and “41st Side South,” respectively – the main streets {{that form the}} geographic boundaries that divide the Queensbridge housing projects. Professor Sohail Daulatzai views this labeling as significant, since it transforms Illmatic into [...] "a sonic map." [...] The album serves as the legend for Nas’s ghetto cartography, as he narrates his experiences and {{those who live in}} the Queensbridge” [...] In a 2009 interview with XXL, Nas discussed the purpose behind the album artwork among other promotional efforts, stating [...] "Really the record had to represent everything Nasir Jones is about from beginning to end, from my album cover to my videos. My record company had to beg me to stop filmin' music videos in the projects. No matter what the song was about I had 'em out there. That's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about for me, being that kid from the projects, being a poster child for that, that didn’t exist back then." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} stunts in the film {{consisted}} of stunt driver [...] "Bumps" [...] Willard (as James Bond) driving an AMC Hornet leaping a broken bridge and spinning around 360 degrees in mid-air about the longitudinal axis, doing an [...] "aerial twist"; Willard successfully completed the jump on the first take. The stunt was shown in slow motion, for the scene was otherwise too fast. Composer John Barry added a slide whistle sound effect over the stunt, which Broccoli kept in despite thinking that it [...] "undercouped the stunt". Barry later regretted his decision, thinking the whistle [...] "broke the golden rule" [...] as the stunt was [...] "for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> worth, a truly dangerous moment,... true James Bond style". The sound effect was described as [...] "simply crass". The writer Jim Smith suggested that the stunt [...] "brings into focus the lack of excitement {{in the rest of}} the film and is spoilt by the use of 'comedy' sound effects." [...] Eon Productions had licensed the stunt, which had been designed by Raymond McHenry. It was initially conceived at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (CAL) in Buffalo, New York as a test for their vehicle simulation software. After development in simulation, ramps were built and the stunt was tested at CAL's proving ground. It toured as part of the All American Thrill Show as the Astro Spiral before it was picked up for the film. The television programme Top Gear attempted to repeat the stunt in June 2008, but failed. The scene where Scaramanga's Matador flies was shot at Bovington Camp, with a model inspired by an actual car plane prototype. Bond's duel with Scaramanga, which Mankewicz said was inspired by the climactic faceoff in Shane, was shortened as the producers felt it was causing pacing problems. The trailers featured some of the cut scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral S. M. Nanda, Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy {{during the}} conflict, stated : [...] "In narrow channels, ships, during an {{emergency}} or war, always throw depth charges around them to deter submarines. One of them probably hit the Ghazi. The blow-up was there, but nobody knew <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about until the fisherman found the life jacket".|$|E

60|$|In {{another place}} the phrase: “At night {{we stood in}} again,” arrested my languid attention, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a sea phrase. “Let’s see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> about,” I thought, without excitement.|$|R

2500|$|In the Magic Lantern {{autobiography}} Bergman {{writes of}} the film's iconic penultimate shot: [...] "The {{image of the}} Dance of Death beneath the dark cloud was achieved at hectic speed {{because most of the}} actors had finished for the day. Assistants, electricians, and a make-up man and about two summer visitors, who never knew <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about, had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death. A camera with no sound was set up and the picture shot before the cloud dissolved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Said former Tigers manager Jim Leyland of Miller's early struggles, [...] "He {{was like}} a lot of guys {{breaking}} into the profession and wasn’t sure <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about. [...] He had a huge arm – big, big stuff — but he found it tough to repeat his delivery. ... He didn't have the command. [...] But I think he's got it right. [...] This game is hard. [...] Success is definitely not a straight line, but are you willing to work?" [...] Former Boston batterymate David Ross, who observed Miller while he was transitioning from starting to relieving full-time, said [...] ""A guy like Andrew Miller has perspective on success and failure, so he understands not to take anything for granted and to stay in the moment and continue to do what he does best. [...] That's character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{basketball}} observers, {{in addition}} to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, {{he said he had}} a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it." [...] Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, he has managed to obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.|$|E

2500|$|Travers left Charterhouse in 1904 and {{was sent}} by his parents to live in Dresden, for a few months, to learn German. While he was there he saw {{performances}} by the leading French actors, Sarah Bernhardt in La Tosca, and Lucien Guitry in Les affaires sont les affaires, which inspired him {{with a passion for}} the theatre. His parents were unimpressed by his ambition to become an actor; he was sent into the family business, the long-established wholesale grocery firm Joseph Travers & Sons Ltd, of which his father was a director. He found commercial life tedious and incomprehensible: [...] "I had no more idea <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about then than I have now and vice versa." [...] He served first at the firm's head office in Cannon Street in the City of London, which was dominated by dauntingly-bearded Victorian patriarchs. From there, to his and the patriarchs' relief, he was soon transferred to the company's offices in Singapore and then Malacca.|$|E
