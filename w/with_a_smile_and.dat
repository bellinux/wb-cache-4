He leaves {{to help people in}} the First Sino-Japanese War, as he had promised the Meiji government. When he returns to Japan, Kenshin collapses in Kaoru's arms and dies.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{examining}} employers' {{attempts to}} regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' {{respond to these}} regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage {{in some form of}} emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{engagement}} Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation picture a cabin portrait {{to celebrate his}} victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin before dinner, while listening to pipe and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and reading from a sheet of music propped against a wine glass. A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> drops gravy {{down the back of}} the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, to be the most famous in British art.|$|E

500|$|The {{first part}} of this {{sequence}} celebrated the National Health Service ("the institution which more than any other unites our nation", according to the programme), which had been founded in the year of the previous London Games in 1948. [...] Music was by Mike Oldfield. 600 dancers, all of whom were NHS staff, along with 1,200 volunteers recruited from British hospitals, entered along with children on 320 hospital beds, some of which functioned as trampolines. [...] They started a short jive routine. Watching from the tor were specially invited hospital staff and nine child patients from Great Ormond Street Hospital. The blankets on the beds illuminated and the beds were arranged to depict a child's face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> a tear (the Hospital Children's Charity's logo). [...] The acronym 'GOSH' then changed into the initials 'NHS', turning into the shape of a crescent moon as the children were hushed to sleep and read books by the nurses.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{standing}} only [...] tall in heels, {{she often}} caught {{the gaze of}} men in the street, being attractive and full-figured.

[...] A nephew later said that she could [...] "make a joke out of nothing", and could have [...] "walked out of a burning house <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> a joke". She frequented Liverpool's dance halls and clubs where she was often asked to dance in jitterbug competitions with dockers, soldiers, sailors, and waiters. It was remarked that she could be as humorous as any man and would sing the popular songs of the day at any time of day or night. Her voice sounded similar to Vera Lynn's, whilst Lennon specialised in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. [...] She played the ukulele, the piano accordion, and the banjo (as did Lennon), although neither pursued music professionally. They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and talking of what they would do in the future: opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club.|$|E
500|$|In the OVAs of the series, Kenshin {{is given}} a more humanized design. There are also {{numerous}} changes to his life story {{compared to that of}} the manga, including the way he received his X-shaped scar in [...] from 1999. In [...] released in 2001, as time passes, Kenshin becomes tortured with guilt for leading a happy life after such a destructive past.

The two finally meet, and Kenshin collapses into her arms as he clutches her. Kaoru then notices Kenshin's scar has faded away, signifying his death. After watching the last OVA, Nobuhiro Watsuki was quite unhappy with how the story ended, saying that [...] "Kenshin went through so much crap and deserved a happy ending." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for Stylus Magazine, Scott Plagenhoef wrote that on Rings Around the World, the band are [...] "gleefully working {{outside of a}} scene or prototype" [...] and [...] "dabbling {{in a world of}} musical {{influences}} and Western hegemony, playing the merry prankster to Radiohead's gloom – and all <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> in three-part harmony". Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the record, claiming that it [...] "shines brightly" [...] compared to the [...] "dead world of mainstream and indie rock in 2001" [...] but expressed disappointment that it is [...] "the first SFA album not to progress from its predecessor". Rob Brunner of Entertainment Weekly claimed that at its best, the album [...] "recalls a lost Brian Wilson-style psychedelic marvel", but went on to state that it is [...] "at times marred by forced eccentricity", citing the [...] "heavy metal gorgon voice booming through 'Receptacle for the Respectable'" [...] and the [...] "awful lite-rock homage" [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as examples. Q stated that, although songs such as [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] and [...] "Presidential Suite" [...] are [...] "excellent", the album features [...] "nothing to change anyone's world", while the NME claimed that, despite containing some great songs, it is the band's worst album. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice singled out [...] "Tradewinds" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating a [...] "good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Veach was {{the subject}} of a motivational tactic by new player-manager Cobb. Cobb {{believed}} that Veach, who came to bat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> engaged in friendly conversation with umpires and opposing pitchers, was too easygoing. Tigers historian Fred Lieb described Veach as a [...] "happy-go-lucky guy, not too brilliant above the ears", who [...] "was as friendly as a Newfoundland pup with opponents as well as teammates". (Fred Lieb, [...] "The Detroit Tigers") Hoping to light a fire in Veach, Cobb persuaded Harry Heilmann, who followed Veach in the batting order, to taunt Veach from the on-deck circle. [...] "I want you to make him mad. Real mad[...] [...] [...] hile you're waiting, call him a yellow belly, a quitter and a dog. … Take that smile off his face". The tactic may have worked, as Veach had career-highs in RBIs (126) and home runs (16), and his batting average jumped from [...]308 to [...]338. Cobb had promised to tell Veach about the scheme when the season was over, but never did. When Heilmann tried to explain, Veach reportedly snarled, [...] "Don't come sucking around me with that phony line". Veach never forgave Heilmann.
