6000|$|... "Why, it's all a poem!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} at the end. [...] "It's magnificent; {{and you thought}} I'd laugh!" [...] She looked reproachful. [...] "I think it's {{incredibly}} beautiful. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> We may meet him some time--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wounded?" [...] cried Gian Maria, in a shout. [...] "Now, by God, {{it is as}} I suspected. I'll swear he {{got that}} wound the night before at Sant' Angelo. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> fool? Tell me that, and you shall go free." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah! {{she will}} do for the lord; she loves a lord. My dear lady, you come so late, and yet I am always {{so glad to see}} you.

6000|$|For a {{long time}} there was nothing at all. Nothing beyond the crystal mesh of the cage. Thoughts rushed through Conger's mind, helter-skelter. How would he know the man? How could he be certain, in advance? What had he looked like? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> How had he acted, before he spoke? Would he be an {{ordinary}} person, or some strange outlandish crank? ...|$|E
6000|$|Rip looked, and beheld {{a precise}} {{counterpart}} {{of himself as}} he went up the mountain; apparently as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or another man. In {{the midst of his}} bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Father Conmee stopped {{three little}} schoolboys {{at the corner}} of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I did," [...] said Grandma excitedly. [...] "Why, it's the man I {{met on the}} train. Who <b>is</b> he? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> Now, we'll {{know where}} to send--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--and he {{be such a}} man of prowess as ye speak of, said Sir Gawaine. Now, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> Sir, said they, <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> Marhaus the king's son of Ireland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me, Quashy," [...] said Manuela, an {{expression}} of sympathy appearing at once on her fine eyebrows, [...] "who <b>is</b> it? <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> and why does he send for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I shall greatly {{prefer to}} her speaking--as {{she did so}} extraordinarily, out of the blue, at Dedborough, upon my honour--for the {{wonderful}} friends she picks up: the picture-man introduced by her (<b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?)</b> who regularly 'cheeked' me, as I suppose he'd call it, in my own house, and whom I hope, by the way, that under this roof she's not able to be quite so thick with!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{that about}} the Grand Marshal and a boar {{as big as a}} bonasus? Quite wrong; natural son of Beckendorff; know it for a fact. Don't you see he is being {{introduced}} to von Sohnspeer! brothers, you know, managed the whole business about the leagued Princes; not a son of Beckendorff, only a particular friend; the son of the late General--, I forget his name exactly. Killed at Leipsic, you know; that famous general; <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> that very famous general; don't you remember? Never mind; well! he is his son; father particular friend of Beckendorff; college friend; brought up the orphan; very handsome of him! They say he does handsome things sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the young}} ladies had {{undergone}} the examination through which Bows put them, they were rewarded with their gingerbread medals, {{and went off}} to discuss them in the court. Meanwhile Fanny took out some work, and pretended to busy herself with it, her mind being in great excitement and anger, as she plied her needle. Bows sate so that he could command the entrance from the lodge to the street. But the person whom, perhaps, he expected to see, never made his appearance again. And Mrs. Bolton came in from market, and found Mr. Bows in place of the person whom she had expected to see. The reader perhaps can guess <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{answered}} Sir Nigel, [...] "I cannot {{go until}} I have seen {{more of this}} person, for {{he appears to be}} a man from whom much is to <b>be</b> hoped. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> and title?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Flora!" [...] began Miss Rich, {{adhering}} {{to her as}} they parted with the rest {{at the end of}} the street, [...] "how am I to write to a principal? Am I to begin Reverend Sir, or My Lord, or is he Venerable, like an archdeacon? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>am</b> I to say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye--indeed?--he {{must be in}} high {{trust for}} so young a gentleman. I wish you joy, sir,' bowing to Fairford. 'By'r lady, as Shakespeare says, you are {{bringing}} up a neck for a fair end. Come, patron, we will drink to Mr. What-shall-call-um. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> Did you tell me?

6000|$|... "And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, {{she seemed}} to be," [...] {{continued}} he; [...] "asked more questions about the house, and terms, and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived {{a few years back}} at Monkford. Bless me! <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother?" ...|$|E
60|$|Dunburne's mysterious guide, still {{carrying}} the lantern, conducted him directly up a broad flight of steps, and opening the door, ushered {{him into a}} hallway of no inconsiderable pretensions. Thence {{he led the way}} to a dining-room beyond, where our young gentleman observed a long mahogany table, and a sideboard of carved mahogany illuminated by three or four candles. In answer to the call of his conductor, a negro servant appeared, whom the master of the house ordered to fetch some bread and cheese and a bottle of rum for his wretched guest. While the servant was gone to execute the commission the master seated himself at his ease and favored Dunburne with a long and most minute regard. Then he suddenly asked our young gentleman <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then we loafed along {{past the}} Nickersons, {{and of course}} they asked if that was the new {{stranger}} yonder, and where'd he come from, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> and which communion was he, Babtis' or Methodis', and which politics, Whig or Democrat, and how long is he staying, and all them other questions that humans always asks when a stranger comes, and animals does, too. But Tom said he warn't able to make anything out of deef and dumb signs, and the same with goo-gooing. Then we watched them go and bullyrag Jake; because we was pretty uneasy for him. Tom said it would take him days to get so he wouldn't forget he was a deef and dummy sometimes, and speak out before he thought. When we had watched long enough to see that Jake was getting along all right and working his signs very good, we loafed along again, allowing to strike the schoolhouse about recess time, which was a three-mile tramp.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Montgomery Floyd {{looked a}} little puzzled: 'My great favourite!' exclaimed the irritated Lady Bellair, rapping her fan against the sofa. 'Oh! why do you not {{remember}} names! I love people who remember names. My favourite, my Bath favourite. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> He <b>is</b> to dine with me in town. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> {{the name of my}} Bath favourite who is certainly to dine with me in town?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{asked him}} for it, and he told it me. I only asked him the two questions, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> Chris’en <b>name,</b> and whether he’d a sweetheart? And he answered, Edwin, and he hadn’t.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{words of}} Agur son of Jakeh, ofMassa (המשא); The speech {{of the man}} to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal: [...] "I am brutish, less than a man; I lack common sense. I have not learned wisdom, Nor do I possess {{knowledge}} of the Holy One. Who has ascended heaven and come down? Who has gathered up {{the wind in the}} hollow of his hand? Who has wrapped the waters in his garment? Who has established all the extremities of the earth? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> or <b>his</b> son's <b>name,</b> if you know it?"

6000|$|Ethel {{felt as if}} {{she could}} bear it better, and was more up to the work after this. Next, the {{children}} were desired to stand round the room, and Mr. Wilmot tried who could say the Catechism--the two biggest, a boy and a girl, had not an idea of it, and the boy looked foolish, and grinned at being asked <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> One child was tolerably perfect, and about half a dozen had some dim notions. Three were entirely ignorant of the Lord's Prayer, and many of the others did not by any means pronounce the words of it. Jane and Fanny Taylor, Rebekah Watts, and Mrs. Green's little boy, were the only ones who, by their own account, used morning and evening prayers, though, on further examination, it appeared that Polly and Jenny Hall, and some others, were accustomed to repeat the old rhyme about [...] "Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John," [...] and Una M'Carthy and her little brother Fergus said something that nobody could make out, but which Mr. Wilmot thought had once been an [...] "Ave Maria." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne {{was on her}} guard, though Bertram probed her well. Was {{there only}} one {{shepherd}}? Was there not a boy {{with her on the}} hill-side where Bertram met her? The shepherd lad in sooth! What became of him? The shepherd sent him back, he had been too long away from his flock. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> What was the shepherd's name? Who was his master? Anne did not know--she had heard no names save Hob and Hal, she had seen no arms, she had heard nothing southland. The lad was a mere herd-boy, ordered out to milk ewes and tend the sheep. She answered briefly, and with a certain sullenness, and young Selby at last turned on her. 'Look thee here, fair lady, there's a saying abroad that the heir of the red-handed House of Clifford is lurking here, on the look-out to favour Queen Margaret and her son. Couldst thou put us on the scent, King Edward would favour thee and make thee a great dame, and have thee to his Court--nay, maybe give thee what is left of the barony of Clifford.' ...|$|E
60|$|Cromwell {{detached}} {{a strong}} party of choice troops, {{under the command}} of an officer by the name of Joyce, to carry the plan into effect. These troops were all horsemen, so that their movements could be made with the greatest celerity. They arrived at Holmby House at midnight. The cornet, for that was the military title by which Joyce was designated, drew up his horsemen about the palace, and demanded entrance. Before his company arrived, however, there had been an alarm that they were coming, and the guards had been doubled. The officers in command asked the cornet <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> and business. He replied that he was Cornet Joyce, and that his business was to speak to the king. They asked him by whom he was sent, and he replied that he was sent by himself, and that he must and would see the king. They then commanded their soldiers to stand by their arms, and be ready to fire when the word should be given. They, however, perceived that Joyce and his force were a detachment from the army to which they themselves belonged, and concluding to receive them as brothers, they opened the gates and let them in.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{followed}} a strange conversation. Moses was terrified {{at the thought}} of what he had to do, and reasonably: moreover, the Israelites in Egypt had forgotten God. 'And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> <b>what</b> shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I Am that I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Men love to {{understand}} a man before they commit their cause unto him-to wit, whether he be fitly qualified for their business. Well, here is an Advocate propounded, an Advocate to plead our cause against our foe. But <b>what</b> <b>is</b> he? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>name?</b> Is he qualified for my business? The answer is, It is Jesus Christ. How? Jesus Christ, what! That old friend of publicans and sinners? Jesus Christ! He used never to fail, he used to set his face like a flint against Satan when he pleaded {{the cause of his}} people. Is it Jesus Christ? says the knowing soul; then he shall be mine Advocate.|$|R
5000|$|Long Danzi, {{an ancient}} green dragon; the last wild {{imperial}} dragon in the Han Empire. He travels with Ping {{to the ocean}} where he takes a mysterious stone, but he won't explain to Ping <b>what</b> it <b>is.</b> <b>His</b> <b>name</b> means 'courageous dragon' ...|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{fortunate}} {{series of}} accidents {{that brought the}} story to the doctor. He understood and pitied the position of these wretched men, and came whole-heartedly to their assistance. He and Wicks and Carthew (so {{soon as he was}} recovered) held a hundred councils and prepared a policy for San Francisco. It was he who certified [...] "Goddedaal" [...] unfit to be moved, and smuggled Carthew ashore under cloud of night; it was he who kept Wicks's wound open that he might sign with his left hand; he who took all their Chile silver and (in the course of the first day) got it converted for them into portable gold. He used his influence in the ward-room to keep the tongues of the young officers in order, so that Carthew's identification was kept out of the papers. And he rendered another service yet more important. He had a friend in San Francisco, a millionaire: to this man he privately presented Carthew as a young gentleman come newly into a huge estate, but troubled with Jew debts which he was trying to settle on the quiet. The millionaire came readily to help; and it was with his money that the wrecker gang was to be fought. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> out of a thousand guesses? It was Douglas Longhurst.|$|E
60|$|The next Morning Monsieur Misson {{called for}} the Captain of the Privateer, he told him, he could not but allow him a brave Fellow, to venture upon a Ship of his Countenance, and for that Reason he should meet Treatment which Men of his Profession seldom afforded the Prisoners they made. He asked him how long he had been out, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>Name,</b> {{and what he had}} on Board? He {{answered}} he was but just come out, that he was the first Sail he had met with, and should have thought himself altogether as lucky not to have spoke with him' that his Name was Harry Ramsey, and what he had on Board were Rags, Powder, Ball, and some few half Anchors of Rum. Ramsey was ordered into the Gun-Room, and a Council being held in the publick Manner aforesaid, the Bulk Head of the great Cabbin rowled up. On their Conclusion, the Captain of the Privateer was called in again, when Captain Misson told him, he would return him his Sloop, and restore him and his Men to their Liberty, without stripping or plundering of any Thing, but what Prudence obliged him to, their Ammunition and Small-Arms, if he would give him his Word and Honour, and his Men to take an Oath, not {{to go out on the}} Privateer Account in six Months after they left him: That he did not design to continue that Station above a Week longer, at the Expiration of which Time he would let them go.|$|E
60|$|It was a noble big balloon, and had {{wings and}} fans {{and all sorts}} of things, and wasn't like any balloon you see in pictures. It was away out toward the edge of town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street; and there was a big crowd around it, making fun of it, and making fun of the man,--a lean pale feller with that soft kind of {{moonlight}} in his eyes, you know,--and they kept saying it wouldn't go. It made him hot to hear them, and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they was animals and blind, but some day they would find they had stood face to face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations, and was too dull to know it; and right here on this spot their own children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that would outlast a thousand years, but his name would outlast the monument. And then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, and yell at him, and ask him <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> before he was married, and what he would take to not do it, and what was his sister's cat's grandmother's name, {{and all the things that}} a crowd says when they've got hold of a feller that they see they can plague. Well, some things they said WAS funny,--yes, and mighty witty too, I ain't denying that,--but all the same it warn't fair nor brave, all them people pitching on one, and they so glib and sharp, and him without any gift of talk to answer back with. But, good land! what did he want to sass back for? You see, it couldn't do him no good, and it was just nuts for them. They HAD him, you know. But that was his way. I reckon he couldn't help it; he was made so, I judge. He was a good enough sort of cretur, and hadn't no harm in him, and was just a genius, as the papers said, which wasn't his fault. We can't all be sound: we've got to be the way we're made. As near as I can make out, geniuses think they know it all, and so they won't take people's advice, but always go their own way, which makes everybody forsake them and despise them, and that is perfectly natural. If they was humbler, and listened and tried to learn, it would be better for them.|$|E
5000|$|It <b>is</b> {{not known}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> real <b>name</b> - the {{expression}} [...] "Naiman Beg" [...] {{is not a}} name but a title that means [...] "Prince of Naimans". This title implies that he was relative to khan dynasty ruling in Mongol Empire.|$|R
