40|$|Background/Aims: There {{are many}} {{cognitive}} screening instruments available to clinicians when assessing patients' cognitive function, {{but the best}} way to compare the diagnostic utility of these tests is uncertain. One method is to undertake a <b>weighted</b> <b>comparison</b> which takes into account the difference in sensitivity and specificity of two tests, the relative clinical misclassification costs of true- and false-positive diagnosis, and also disease prevalence. Methods: Data were examined from four pragmatic diagnostic accuracy studies from one clinic which compared the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Test Your Memory (TYM) test, and the Mini-Mental Parkinson (MMP), respectively. Results: <b>Weighted</b> <b>comparison</b> calculations suggested a net benefit for ACE-R, MoCA, and MMP compared to MMSE, but a net loss for TYM test compared to MMSE.

Our purpose was to identify the fMR correlates of interictal epileptiform discharges. METHODS: Twenty patients with epilepsy and frequent interictal discharges were studied with concurrent EEG monitoring on a 1. 5 -T echo-planar magnet to acquire blood-oxygenationlevel–dependent (BOLD) images in the baseline (OFF) and immediate post-discharge (ON) states. Analysis was performed using subtraction of average ON and OFF data (method I); cross-correlation analysis between the ON and OFF states (method II); and individual spike analysis (ISA), with which signal intensity in the individual ON states was statistically analyzed using a <b>weighted</b> <b>comparison</b> with the mean and variance of the OFF states (method III). Agreement of fMR activation with EEG localization was determined. RESULTS: Eighteen of 20 patients had interictal discharges during the monitoring period. Method I yielded visually detectable sites of BOLD signal differences in only one patient. Method II resulted in two patients with sites of BOLD activation. Method III, ISA, resulted in regions of increased BOLD signal corresponding to the EEG focus in nine of 10 patients...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{evolution}} {{depends on}} intramolecular coevolutionary networks whose complexity {{is proportional to}} the underlying functional and structural interactions among sites. Here we present a novel approach that vastly improves the sensitivity of previous methods for detecting coevolution through a <b>weighted</b> <b>comparison</b> of divergence between amino acid sites. The analysis of the HIV- 1 Gag protein detected convergent adaptive coevolutionary events responsible for the selective variability emerging between subtypes. Coevolution analysis and functional data for heat-shock proteins, Hsp 90 and GroEL, highlight that almost all detected coevolving sites are functionally or structurally important. The results support previous suggestions pinpointing the complex interdomain functional interactions within these proteins and we propose new amino acid sites as important for interdomain functional communication. Three-dimensional information sheds light on the functional and structural constraints governing the coevolution between sites. Our covariation analyses propose two types of coevolving sites in agreement with previous reports: pairs of sites spatially proximal, where compensatory mutations could maintain the local structure stability, and clusters of distant sites located in functional domains, suggesting a functional dependency between them. All sites detected under adaptive evolution in these proteins belong to coevolution groups, further underlining the importance of testing for coevolution in selective constraints analyses...|$|R

Two parties competing in a binary election may purchase votes in a sequential bidding game via up-front binding payments and/or campaign promises (platforms) that are contingent upon {{the outcome of the}} election.

For instance, if only campaign promises are allowed, then the winning party depends not only on the relative size of the budgets, but also on the excess support of the party with the a priori majority, where the excess support is measured in terms of the (minimal) total utility of supporting voters who are in excess of the majority needed to win. If up front vote buying is permitted, and voters care directly about how they vote (as a legislator would), then the determination of the winning party depends on a <b>weighted</b> <b>comparison</b> of the two parties' budgets plus half of the total utility of their supporting voters.
