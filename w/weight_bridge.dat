40|$|Introduction It is {{important}} for owners and vets to accurately estimate their equines weight in order to administer anthelminitics and antibiotics. Our hypothesis is: the Virbac PAVO Horse Weight Tape will be less accurate estimating the weight of ponies compared to horses. Materials and methods 20 adult horses, mean age 10 yr (± SD 5), and 20 adult ponies 13 yr (± SD 6) of various breeds were included. The horses {{were divided into two}} groups based on height at the withers. The weight was estimated using the Horse Weight Tape followed by weighing on a <b>weight</b> <b>bridge.</b> Results The mean weight of the horses and ponies was 566. 45 kg (± SD 66. 70) and 331. 35 kg (± SD 153. 07), respectively. In horses, the average deviation of the estimation using the Horse Weight Tape was 2. 77...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{success of}} many {{learning}} algorithms {{hinges on the}} re-liable selection or construction {{of a set of}} highly predictive features. Kernel-based feature <b>weighting</b> <b>bridges</b> the gap between feature extrac-tion and subset selection. This paper presents a rigorous derivation of the Kernel-Relief algorithm and assesses its effectiveness in comparison with other state-of-art techniques. For practical considerations, an online sparsification procedure is incorporated into the basis construction pro-cess by assuming that the kernel bases form a causal series. The proposed sparse Kernel-Relief algorithm not only produces nonlinear features with extremely sparse kernel expressions but also reduces the computational complexity significantly. ...|$|R

50|$|There are two chief {{ways that}} balsa wood bridge {{competitions}} may be scored. One way is simply by measuring how much <b>weight</b> each <b>bridge</b> can support. The second way is by structural efficiency, often {{expressed as a}} strength to weight ratio. The weight-only method is most effective where competitors are all building from a specified set of materials {{and are expected to}} use all the available materials. The strength-to-weight method is better when competitors are expected to use their materials as efficiently as possible.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the most}} {{remarkable}} achievements of Chinese bridge building-indeed an advancement unrivaled in the world-was the creation of this segmental arch bridge of wholly stone construction. This innovation, which occurred {{between the end of}} the sixth century and beginning of the seventh century, repudiated conventional wisdom that a semicircular arch was necessary to transfer the <b>weight</b> of a <b>bridge</b> downwards to where the arch tangentially meets the pier. The double pair of openings piercing both ends of the arch spandrel, which as well as accentuating its lithe curvature, lightens the <b>weight</b> of the <b>bridge</b> and facilitates the diversion of flood waters by allowing them to pass through the auxiliary arches rather than pound against the spandrels. The Zhaozhou Bridge is celebrated as China's oldest standing bridge and the oldest open spandrel stone bridge in the world.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of vehicle <b>weight</b> estimations from <b>bridge</b> weigh-in-motion system is studied. The measured bending {{moments of the}} instrumented bridge under a passage of vehicle are numerically simulated and are used as the input for the vehicle weight estimations. Two weight estimation methods assuming constant magnitudes and time-varying magnitudes of vehicle axle loads are investigated. The appropriate number of bridge elements and sampling frequency are considered. The effectiveness in term of the estimation accuracy is evaluated and compared under various parameters of vehicle-bridge system. The effects of vehicle speed, vehicle configuration, vehicle <b>weight</b> and <b>bridge</b> surface roughness on {{the accuracy of the}} estimated vehicle weights are intensively investigated. Based on the obtained results, vehicle speed, surface roughness level and measurement error seem to have stronger effects on the weight estimation accuracy than other parameters. In general, both methods can provide quite accurate weight estimation of the vehicle. Comparing between them, although the weight estimation method assuming constant magnitudes of axle loads is faster, the method assuming time-varying magnitudes of axle loads can provide axle load histories and exhibits more accurate weight estimations of the vehicle for almost of the considered cases...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Subtherapeutic {{international}} normalized ratios {{are frequently}} encountered in clinical practice, and patients with mechanical heart valves with inadequate anticoagulation may {{be exposed to}} {{an increased risk of}} thromboembolic events. There are no data on thromboembolic event risk for these patients. METHODS: We assessed the current practice patterns in the management of patients with mechanical heart valves with subtherapeutic international normalized ratios and assessed the risk of thromboembolic complications in this setting. The charts of patients with mechanical heart valves followed up in two anticoagulation clinics were reviewed. Patients with a history of stable, therapeutic anticoagulation but with a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio were included. Patients who underwent invasive procedures requiring temporary suspension of antithrombotic therapy were excluded. Data on use and dose of low-molecular <b>weight</b> heparin <b>bridging</b> therapy were collected. RESULTS: The incidence of objectively confirmed thromboembolic events within 90 days after obtaining the index international normalized ratio was assessed. Two hundred ninety-four patients with mechanical heart valves were included (mean age 63. 3 years, 47. 3 % male). Low-molecular weight heparin was prescribed in 14 cases (4. 8 %). At 90 days, 1 patient had a thromboembolic complication (0. 3 %, 95 % confidence interval 0 %- 1. 9 %). CONCLUSION: Patients with previously stable, therapeutic anticoagulation with a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio have a low risk of thromboembolic events. Withholding low-molecular <b>weight</b> heparin <b>bridging</b> therapy is a reasonable therapeutic option in these cases...|$|R
