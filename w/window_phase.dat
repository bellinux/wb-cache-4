This protocol uses {{a so-called}} access <b>window</b> <b>phase,</b> {{to agree on}} a set of transmissions that can simultaneously proceed. During the signaling for a transmission, each potential receiver announces the transmission power to be used by the communication partner as well as a common maximum interference level it can tolerate from a single newly starting transmission.

40|$|Purpose. To compare {{radiation}} dose and image quality using predefined narrow <b>phase</b> <b>window</b> versus complete <b>phase</b> <b>window</b> with dose modulation during R-R using 320 -row MDCTA. Methods. 114 patients underwent coronary CTA study using 320 -row MDCT scanner. 87 patients {{with mean age}} (61 + 13 years), mean BMI (29 + 6), and mean heart rate (HR) (58 + 7 [*]bpm) were imaged at predefined 66 – 80 % R-R interval and then reconstructed at 75 % while 27 patients with mean age (63 + 16 years), mean BMI (28 + 5), and mean HR (57 + 7 [*]bpm) were scanned throughout the complete R-R interval with tube current modulation. The effective dose (ED) was calculated from dose length product (DLP) and conversion k (0. 014 [*]mSv/mGy/cm). Image quality was assessed using a three-point ordinal scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, and 3 = nondiagnostic). Results. Both groups were statistically similar to each other with reference of HR (P= 0. 59), BMI (P= 0. 17), and tube current mAs (P= 0. 68). The median {{radiation dose}} was significantly higher in those scanned with complete R-R <b>phase</b> <b>window</b> versus narrow <b>phase</b> <b>window</b> (P< 0. 0001). Independently of patient and scan parameters, increased <b>phase</b> <b>window</b> was associated with higher radiation dose (P< 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{have shown}} that human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) residual risk is higher in Brazilian than in US and European blood donors, probably due to failure to defer at-risk individuals in Brazil. This study assessed the impact of an educational brochure in enhancing blood donors` knowledge about screening test <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> and reducing at-risk individuals from donating. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This trial compared an educational intervention with a blood center`s usual practice. The brochure was distributed in alternating months to all donors. After donating, sampled participants completed two questions about their HIV window period knowledge. The impact on HIV risk deferral, leaving without donation, confidential unit exclusion (CUE) use, and test positivity was also analyzed. RESULTS: From August to November 2007 we evaluated 33, 940 donations in the main collection center of Fundacao Pro-Sangue/Hemocentro de Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A significant (p < 0. 001) pamphlet effect was found on correct responses to both questions assessing HIV <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> knowledge (68. 1 % vs. 52. 9 %) and transfusion risk (91. 1 % vs. 87. 2 %). After adjusting for sex and age, the pamphlet effect was strongest for people with more than 8 years of education. There was no significant pamphlet effect on HIV risk deferral rate, leaving without donation, use of CUE, or infectious disease rates.

HBV-DNA screening using high sensitivity nucleic amplification technology (NAT) assays has recently been introduced to reduce the residual risk of transmission of HBV by transfusion of blood components. Materials Over 1 year 75 063 donations were individually screened for HBV-DNA by the Ultrio Procleix assay on the Tigris platform. The donations were collected in the Latium region, {{an area of the}} central Italy, and they accounted for the 40 % of the total blood units collected in this area per year. The initial reactive samples were re-tested and confirmed by the discriminatory HBV assay. Additional HBV serological markers were also performed. Suspected WP infections were followed-up to monitor the development of the immune response. All HBV-DNA-positive donors were called back to check up their infectious status. Results The results of testing the 75 063 donations are: 33 donations HBsAg positive, 31 out of them HBV-DNA-positive and two HBV-DNA negative; 22 donations HBsAg-negative but HBV-DNA positive with low viral load. Six of the 22 were found to be consistently HBV-DNA reactive whereas the remaining 16 donations showed inconsistent results on multiple NAT retesting. One WP infection was confirmed by the follow-up of the donor for 3 months following the index blood donation. Conclusions In the donor population of the Latium region, NAT screening has revealed a higher than expected number of donors who were HBsAg non-reactive but HBV-DNA-positive with three donors showing HBV-DNA as the only marker of infection. The adoption of genome screening has increased the safety of the blood supply and has also contributed to the protection of donor health by identifying either WP or clinically silent infections. © 2009 International Society of Blood Transfusion...|$|E

Reservoirs are {{supplied by}} Carboniferous sources, lying directly beneath. Permian Rotliegend sandstones belong to the most important gas bearing formations in Poland. They were deposited in playa, fluvial and aeolian depositional systems (Kiersnowski et al. 2010). Both conventional and unconventional accumulations occur in those sediments. Some of unconventional accumulations occur in conditions of Basin-Centered Gas System (BCGS). Basin-Centered Gas Systems are unconventionals with the greatest economical potential in the world. They are gas saturated, abnormally pressured, a low-permeability reservoirs commonly showing lack of a down - dip water contact. Two types BCGS can be distinguished - direct and indirect. Differentiation results from the attributes of the system - type of organic matter, thermal maturity, sealing and the distance of hydrocarbons migration (Law 2002). Direct Basin-Centered Gas Systems may occur {{in the area of}} the Polish part of Permian Basin. The purpose of present studies was indicating Permian Rotliegend sandstones as a reservoir rocks for direct Basin-Centered Gas Accumulations, which are associated with BCGS, according to reflectance of vitrinite measurement and permeability. Analysis were performed on eight core samples located within the aeolian sediments of Eastern Erg (center of Polish part of Permian Basin) from the depth interval 3702 — 4200 m. Vitrinite reflectance measurement (Ro) were performed on polished pellets, under oil immersion with Zeiss Axioplan microscope in reflected white light. Mean reflectance values were calculated for all measurement. Permeability measurements were done on plug-type samples (cylindrical with diameter 25. 4 mm and length of between 20 - 40 mm. Plugs were drilled perpendicularly to the cylinder axis. In each sample organic matter was dominated by vitrinite. It could indicate humic organic matter typical for gas prone source rocks. The measured vitrinite reflectance values confirmed that organic matter reached the maturation stages of hydrocarbon generation, characteristic for the gas <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> (Ro > 2 %). Permeability results shown typical values for tight sandstones from BCGS, lower than 0. 1 mD. Performed studies on aeolian Rotliegend sandstones from Eastern Erg area confirmed the opportunity of Basin-Centered Gas Accumulations occurrence in those sediments. Humic type of organic matter and values of vitrinite reflectance corresponding to gas <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> are specific for BSGAs. Analyzed samples of aeolian Rotliegend sandstones are characterized by very low permeability, not exceeding 0. 1 mD and therefore capillary sealing of the accumulation. Carboniferous source rock located directly beneath reservoir rock, confirmed short distance of hydrocarbons migration. All mentioned factors allow classifying aeolian Rotliegend sandstones as a reservoir rock within Basin-Centered Gas System. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Abstract — Current {{implementations}} of TCP {{suffer from}} performance problems like bias against flows with higher round trip times (RTTs), synchronization of <b>windows,</b> <b>phase</b> effects in flows and correlated losses leading to throughput degradations with Drop Tail queues. In this {{paper we propose}} a solution to these issues by introducing randomization into the network through end-to-end congestion control protocols. For the TCP case we call it Randomized TCP. Instead of sending back-to-back packets, Randomized TCP spaces successive packet transmissions with a time interval � � �, where is a zero mean random number drawn from an Uniform distribution. Randomized TCP, by introducing randomization in the network, reduces synchronization, phase effects and bias against bursty traffic and longer RTT flows, prevalent with current implementations of TCP and Drop Tail Gateways. Our results suggest that by randomizing the sending times we can successfully emulate almost all the beneficial features of RED except congestion avoidance. Moreover, these benefits of randomization can be achieved even when it is partially deployed. We also introduce randomization in Binomial schemes and show performance improvements with Drop Tail queues. I...|$|R

These assays have been extensively evaluated for the screening of healthy blood donors, but not in routine laboratory practice. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of the combined HCV Ag/Ab assay Monolisa Ultra and compared it to Monolisa anti-HCV Plus (which only detects anti-HCV antibodies) in 61 HCV RNA-positive patients (genotypes 1 to 5) and in 276 consecutive AxSYM HCV-reactive patients. Discordant sera were tested with immunoblot and PCR. RESULTS: All 61 PCR-positive sera were positive with AxSYM, Monolisa Ultra, and Monolisa Plus. Of the 276 consecutive AxSYM-reactive patients, 177 were confirmed as HCV-positive, 78 were HCV-negative and 21 were HCV-indeterminate. There were 4 false-positive results with Monolisa Ultra compared to 1 false-positive result with Monolisa PLus. The signal/cut-off ratio in immunoblot-negative sera was significantly higher with HCV Ultra compared to HCV Plus (p < 0. 01). Sensitivity and specificity in AxSYM-reactive sera were 99. 4 % and 94. 9 % for Monolisa Ultra and 99. 4 % and 98. 7 % for Monolisa Plus.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the windowing {{problem of the}} short-time frequency analysis that is used in speech recognition systems (SRS). Since human hearing is relatively insensitive to short-time phase distortion of the speech signal there is no apparent reason {{for the use of}} symmetric windows which give a linear phase response. Furthermore, phase information is usually completely disregarded in SRS. This should be contrasted with the well-known fact that relaxation of the linearity constraint on <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> results in a better magnitude response and shorter time delay. These observations form a strong argument in favor of the research presented in this paper. First, a general overview of the role that windows play in the frequency analysis stage of SRS is presented. Important properties for speech recognition are highlighted and potential advantages of asymmetric windows are presented. Among them the shorter time delay and the better magnitude response are most important. Two possible design methods for asymmetric windows are discussed. Since little is known about window influence on SRS performance the design methods are first considered from a frequency analysis point of view. This is followed by practical evaluations on real SRS. Expectations were confirmed by the results. The proposed asymmetric windows increased the robustness of elementary, isolated and connected speech recognition on a variety of adverse test conditions. This is particularly true for the case of a combination of additive and low pass convolutional distortions. Further research on asymmetric windows and on the parameterization process as a whole is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Serum samples {{identified}} as positive for total anti-HBc, but negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, {{are referred to}} as anti-HBc alone. This serological response is compatible with acute, resolved, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection but might also signify occult HBV infection. Once the anti-HBc alone pattern is detected, false-positive reactivity should be ruled out and further analyses can resolve the clinical status of the donor. The identification of anti-HBc positivity in the absence of HBsAg in organ transplant donors and in candidate patients for chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation because of the risk of HBV reactivation. False-positive detection, acute infection during the <b>window</b> <b>phase,</b> and resolved or chronic HBV infection are all possible and only distinguishable if the additional assays are done and measures of liver damage are taken into account. Measurement of serum anti-HBs responses after the administration of HBV vaccination can be useful to distinguish this serological profile. In view of the low risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc alone patients who are candidates for immunosuppressive treatment, such patients might not require pre-emptive antiviral therapy, but should be followed up on a monthly basis for alanine aminotransferase followed by quantitative HBV DNA testing in those with alanine aminotransferase increase. According to specific guidelines, nucleoside analogue prophylaxis is recommended in anti-HBc-positive liver allograft recipients and anti-HBc alone individuals who receive chemotherapy or biological therapy and should be continued for 6 – 12 months after discontinuation of such immunosuppressive therapies to protect against HBV reactivation...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to describe patterns of serologic results among donors to the three Brazilian REDS-II blood centers and correlate with epidemiologic characteristics. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The centers screened donor samples with one Trypanosoma cruzi lysate enzyme immunoassay (EIA). EIA-reactive samples were tested with a second lysate EIA, a recombinant-antigen based EIA, and an immunfluorescence assay. Based on the serologic results, samples were classified as confirmed positive (CP), probable positive (PP), possible other parasitic infection (POPI), and false positive (FP). RESULTS: In 2007 to 2008, a total of 877 of 615, 433 donations were discarded due to Chagas assay reactivity. The prevalences (95 % confidence intervals [CIs]) among first-time donors for CP, PP, POPI, and FP patterns were 114 (99 - 129), 26 (19 - 34), 10 (5 - 14), and 96 (82 - 110) per 100, 000 donations, respectively. CP and PP had similar patterns of prevalence when analyzed by age, sex, education, and location, suggesting that PP cases represent true T. cruzi infections; in contrast the demographics of donors with POPI were distinct and likely unrelated to Chagas disease. No CP cases were detected among 218, 514 repeat donors followed for a total of 718, 187 person-years. CONCLUSION: We have proposed a classification algorithm that may have practical importance for donor counseling and epidemiologic analyses of T. cruzi-seroreactive donors. The absence of incident T. cruzi infections is reassuring with respect to risk of <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> infections within Brazil and travel-related infections in nonendemic countries such as the United States.

40|$|BACKGROUND: National Blood Service Zimbabwe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) risk management strategy includes screening and discarding of first-time donations, which are collected in blood packs without an anticoagulant (dry pack). To evaluate the impact of discarding first-time donations on blood safety the HIV prevalence, incidence, and residual risk in first-time and repeat donations (wet packs) were compared. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donor data from 2002 to 2010 were retrieved from a centralized national electronic donor database and retrospectively analyzed. Chi-square {{test was used to}} compare HIV prevalence with relative risk (RR), and the RR point estimates and 95 % confidence interval (CI) are reported. Trend analysis was done using Cochran-Armitage trend test. HIV residual risk estimates were determined using published residual risk estimation models. RESULTS: Over the 9 years the overall HIV prevalence estimates are 1. 29 % (n = 116, 058) and 0. 42 % (n = 434, 695) for first-time and repeat donations, respectively. The overall RR was 3. 1 (95 % CI, 2. 9 - 3. 3; p < 0. 0001). The overall mean residual transmission risk of HIV <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> donations in first-time was 1 : 7384 (range, 1 : 11, 308 - 1 : 5356) and in repeat donors it was 1 : 5496 (range, 1 : 9943 - 1 : 3347). CONCLUSION: The significantly high HIV prevalence estimates recorded in first-time over repeat donations is indicative of the effectiveness of the HIV risk management strategy. However, comparable residual transmission risk estimates in first-time and repeat donors point to the need to further review the risk management strategies. Given the potential wastage of valuable resources, future studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness and utility of screening and discarding first-time donations...|$|E

RESULTS: Twenty-seven donations or 2. 5 per million tested were HCV RNA-positive/anti-HCV-negative; 14 or 1. 8 per million units tested were HIV RNA-positive/anti-HIV-negative; and 197 or 57. 8 per million donations tested were HBV DNA-positive/hepatitis B surface antigen-negative. Of the latter, 8 (2. 3 / 10 (6)) were collected from donors in the <b>window</b> <b>phase</b> of infection and 189 (55. 5 / 10 (6)) from donors with occult HBV. Sixty-eight percent of the latter donors had hepatitis B surface antibody, 74. 5 percent of whom with concentrations considered protective (>= 10 mIU/mL). CONCLUSION: NAT implementation has improved blood safety by reducing the risk of entering 2. 5 HCV and 1. 8 HIV infectious units per million donations into the blood supply. The yield of NAT in detecting infectious blood before transfusion was higher for HBV than for HCV or HIV. However, the benefit of HBV NAT in terms of avoided HBV-related morbidity and mortality in blood recipients needs to be further evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) distributions {{have been}} studied in a representative oil-pressboard insulation system using a phase resolved PD analyzer built for the purpose. The system divided a cycle of the applied voltage, starting from the zero of positive half cycle, into sixteen equal <b>phase</b> <b>windows</b> (Φ 1 to Φ 16) to determine the discharge magnitude in each phase. PD data are recorded according to their phase of occurrence {{with respect to the}} power frequency cycle, their magnitude and number over a period of time. The effect of different test procedures, stress levels and its duration on the ensuing PD patterns have been statistically studied. The results of the analysis help in identifying the probable <b>phase</b> <b>windows</b> which have significant contribution towards overall aging and the ensuing PD distribution patterns...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that intergestural phasing relations are implemented via coupling terms in a nonlinear dynamical systems model. We extend the dynamical model of relative phasing to include the possibility of attractor states that are characterized by <b>phase</b> <b>windows,</b> and contrast this behavior with standard models that display punctate relative phasing. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} {{analysis of the}} finite-energy Airy beam with a sharply truncated spectrum, which can be generated by a uniformly illuminated, finite-sized spatial light modulator, or <b>windowed</b> cubic <b>phase</b> mask. The resulting “incomplete Airy beam” is tractable mathematically, and differs from an infinite-energy Airy beam by an additional oscillating modulation and the decay of its fringes. Its propagation can be described explicitly using an incomplete Airy function, from which we derive simple expressions for the beam’s total power and mean position. Asymptotic analysis reveals a simple connection between the cutoff and {{the region of the}} beam with Airy-like behavior...|$|R
