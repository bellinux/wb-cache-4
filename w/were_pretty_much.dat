25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E

The writers' decision to team up Jonas with Daniel for {{a significant part of}} the two-part episode [...] "gives credence to Jonas's exit", although [...] "it's a great shame that this new 'partnership' couldn't have continued" [...] since [...] "the two [...] worked so well together". Nemec stated in a 2008interview that [...] "the initial backlash from a very small core, outspoken group of the fandom had a bit of a volatile reaction to it, which is totally natural... I'd say 95-plus percent of the fan base grew to like the character and accepted the character overall. Especially by the time season6 ended, I think people <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much,</b> 'Eh, OK — I'm cool with that.' For the most part." ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{been hired}} by Beam's parent company Melbourne House, fantasy and sci-fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett's place as lead designer. According to Kidd, the given {{timeframe}} for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short, forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous {{five and a half}} to six months. An avid role-player, Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license, but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had already gotten approved. Aspects of Beam's earlier action-adventure game Nightshade, of which Kidd was the writer, director and lead designer, were used as a basis for Shadowrun; specific film noir components such as [...] "dark cityscapes, dialogue-heavy exchanges, and touches of humor" [...] were adapted directly from the former to the latter. To coincide with the last of these qualities, Kidd and programmer Jeff Kamenek altered the original [...] "serious" [...] tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements. According to Kidd, [...] "we made improvements and changes, but the basic concepts <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same [...]" ...|$|E

It's dangerous to live too much in this kind of bubble. We had the chance to distance ourselves a bit from everything that happened since 1996 up until now. I also had the occasion to reflect to the montagne russe that is my personal life after these seven years. The ghosts I'm talking about are the people, the events you're wearing into your soul consciously or not." ...|$|E

Guadagnino engaged deeply with the cast and filmmakers, often cooked and showed films for them in his house. Hammer and Chalamet, who did not have to do a screen test together, {{met for the first time}} during the {{production}} in Crema. They spent a month before shooting together to build character development. [...] "We’d hang out with each other all the time, because we <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the only Americans there, and we were able to defend one another and really get to know one another," [...] Chalamet recalled. The actors rehearsed their scenes every night before shooting, and spent several days shooting completely nude. [...] "I’ve never been so intimately involved with a director before. Luca was able to look at me and completely undress me," [...] Hammer said. At the end of the film, Chalamet wears a distinctive New Romantic-looking shirt, picked by the costume designer Giulia Piersanti.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the later}} {{years of its}} first run on Sat.1 (circa 2001-2003), the Harald Schmidt Show became a critics' {{favourite}} due to Schmidt's [...] "intellectual" [...] sense of humour, especially for incorporating many references to high culture (be it literature, theater, classical music, painting, or cinema), history, and philosophy. Another recurring item were forays into surrealism and absurdity that <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> anathema to commercial or [...] "mainstream" [...] interest: For example, Schmidt hosted one show completely in French (re-broadcast {{a few days later}} on Franco-German channel Arte, this Show en Francaise episode gained glowing reviews from French critics). On another occasion, the screen was blacked for half of the show making it into a [...] "radio broadcast". Another time, he disproved a critic who had written {{that it is impossible to}} spend several minutes on TV just cracking nuts without anybody saying anything. The show's reviews and renown among critics gradually worsened during the years of its ARD run (2004-2010), especially because Schmidt's choice of Oliver Pocher as a new sidekick was considered a mistake that diminished the entire show's quality.|$|E
2500|$|Fenton {{introduced}} continental {{ideas to}} the team, revamping training methods and taking inspiration from higher ranked teams, and even inspiring some. Fenton had been impressed greatly by the all-conquering Hungarians of the 1950s led by Ferenc Puskás, and the Casseteri program {{and development of the}} academy were at the core. [...] Ernie Gregory said (of the 1950s diet), [...] "We'd usually eaten fish or chicken and toast before then, but Dr. Thomas advised us all to eat steak and rice two hours before kick-off. All the other clubs copied us after that." [...] However, not all the changes were strictly down to Fenton; Musgrove attributed much of the training regime to Allison, {{going so far as to}} state that once the players were at the club (signed by Fenton) they <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> Allison's property. [...] As well as being a student of the game himself, Fenton encouraged all players to take coaching badges and many of his former players went on to coaching and managing roles after they retired. [...] The Academy also involved, beyond the routine training and development of the youth and squad, actual tactical discussions between the players.|$|E
2500|$|Harry and the Potters is the eponymous debut studio album by indie {{rock band}} Harry and the Potters, {{released}} on 21 June 2003. The album {{was inspired by}} the first four novels in the Harry Potter book series. It has been released on CD and digital download. In April 2003, the brothers wrote an entire album's worth of songs. The brothers split songwriting responsibilities between the two of them: Joe was responsible for songs dealing with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, whereas Paul was responsible for songs dealing with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and the Potters was recorded [...] at the DeGeorge Family Living Room in Massachusetts. According to Melissa Anelli, Paul wrote the majority of the instrumental tracks on his Casio keyboard, whereas Joe conceptualized most of the vocal tracks. Vocalist Paul DeGeorge later said, [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> writing songs and then recording them on the spot". This statement emphasizes the band's do-it-yourself amateurishness as an essential aspect of the album. In recording Harry and the Potters, the band aimed to release the album shortly before the fifth book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released. According to Paul, [...] "We were in a rush to get that stuff done before the 5th book release" [...] and this instinct supports claims it took only two weekends to record the album. Despite the band's purported rush to finish the album, Paul and Joe worked particularly hard on the song [...] "These Days are Dark." [...] Paul DeGeorge used $1,200 of his own money to finance the pressing of the CDs.|$|E
