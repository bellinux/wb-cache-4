5|$|The main character, Gabriel Belmont (voiced by Robert Carlyle), is {{a member}} of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend {{innocent}} people against the supernatural creatures. Gabriel's wife Marie (Natascha McElhone) was brutally murdered by one of them, and her soul cannot leave as it is trapped in limbo. Because she is now neither alive nor dead, she realizes <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> stake and guides Gabriel to his destiny to save the world as he investigates the dark spell. He travels the destroyed land, meeting other characters, such as the oldest living member of his order, Zobek (Patrick Stewart, who additionally narrates the game). Two masks referred to as the God and Devil Masks lie at the center of the plot, with the God Mask having powers to resurrect the dead. Gabriel intends to defeat the three factions of the Lords of Shadow in order to obtain the pieces of the God Mask and bring back his deceased wife.|$|E

Go Nagai, who pioneered the idea of mecha piloted from an interior cockpit, praised the film's fun and intense action, while game developer Fumito Ueda said its battle scenes surpassed memories of the tokusatsu films he saw as an impressionable child. Science fiction author William Gibson called the film [...] "A ravishing display of intelligent, often wonderfully witty visual design, every frame alive with coherent language, {{in the service of}} <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> heart a children's story… A baroque that doesn't curdle, that never fetishizes itself." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1918, Walter A. Briscoe and H. Russell Stannard {{released}} a seminal biography, Captain Ball VC, reprinting many of Ball's letters and prefaced with encomiums by Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard. Lloyd George wrote that [...] "What {{he says in}} one of his letters, 'I hate this game, but it is the only thing one must do just now', represents, I believe, the conviction of those vast armies who, realising <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> stake, have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved". Haig spoke of Ball's [...] "unrivalled courage" [...] and his [...] "example and incentive to those who have taken up his work". [...] In Trenchard's opinion, Ball had [...] "a wonderfully well-balanced brain, and his loss to the Flying Corps was the greatest loss it could sustain at that time".|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} wave travelling {{down the line}} is not affected in any way by the open circuit {{at the end of}} the line. It cannot have any effect until the step actually reaches that point. The signal cannot have any foreknowledge of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the end of the line and is only affected by the local characteristics of the line. However, if the line is of length [...] the step will arrive at the open circuit at time , at which point the current in the line is zero (by the definition of an open circuit). Since charge continues to arrive {{at the end of the}} line through the incident current, but no current is leaving the line, then conservation of electric charge requires that there must be an equal and opposite current into the end of the line. Essentially, this is Kirchhoff's current law in operation. This equal and opposite current is the reflected current, , and since ...|$|E
500|$|The {{applicant}} has {{the initial}} burden of showing {{that he or}} she has a prima facie case that should be considered by the Court. Once this has been done, it is for the executive to justify the legality of the detention. One commentator has said that the applicant's task is to discharge his or her evidential burden, following which the public authority detaining the applicant has a legal burden of showing that the detention is lawful. The standard of proof required to be achieved by the authority is the civil standard of a balance of probabilities, but [...] "flexibly applied" [...] {{in the sense that the}} degree of probability must be appropriate to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> stake. Thus, in Khawaja Lord Bridge of Harwich said that given the seriousness of the allegations against a detainee and the consequences of the detention, [...] "the court should not be satisfied with anything less than probability of a high degree".|$|E

Epsicokhan also suggested that the flashback sequences were similar to the [...] episode [...] "", but was a [...] "substantially less poignant take on hypothetical material". He said that the episode had [...] "something for everyone", with an [...] "apocalyptic" [...] action storyline which tied in neatly to an interesting character drama. He gave the episode a score of {{three and a half}} out of four. The review on Ain't It Cool News also suggested that the storyline had been inspired by a number of different episodes in the Star Trek franchise, including the Voyager episodes [...] "Year of Hell" [...] and [...] "", as well as The Next Generation [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] and [...] "". But the reviewer thought that the episode presented the viewer with a sense of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> stake with the fight against the Xindi for the first time, and gave the episode a score of four out of five, a grade described as [...] "better than most motion pictures".|$|E
