5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as he would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of}} the Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E

IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E

Although the French had scaled back their demands to some extent, the British also claimed to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> Lebanon in the future Arab State and this meeting also ended at an impasse.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{original}} program, Varsity Scouts {{were not allowed}} to wear the field uniform of tradition Boy Scouting. Lynn Larsen, wife of Professional Scouter Doug Larsen, and June Weise sewed the first Varsity Scout uniforms. Despite the name, Varsity Scouting was never intended to be a strictly sports-oriented program. The organizers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> athletics {{as a part of the}} program, but they also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> outdoor high-adventure and ample opportunities for service.|$|R
25|$|Although World War II had {{interrupted}} {{production of}} the Ercoupe, general aviation manufacturers were enthusiastic about the prospects of a postwar aviation boom. Thousands {{of men and women}} were trained as pilots by the government, and the hope was that they would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> flying in their civilian life. Production of the model 415-C resumed in 1945, and in 1946 alone 4,311 aircraft were produced and sold at a cost of US$2,665. This was the same price as in 1941. At its peak, ERCO was turning out 34 Ercoupes per day, operating three shifts per day. The aircraft was aggressively marketed through unconventional outlets such as the men's department of the Macy's department store chain.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Angel Beats! follows {{an interactive}} branching plot line with multiple scenarios. Originally {{meant to be}} a role-playing game, Maeda eventually conceded to making it into a visual novel adventure game. When designing the game, Maeda did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> choices for the player that would not have a meaningful effect, so the choices given were focused to {{have an effect on the}} plot and character interactions. A reviewer noted that its game structure makes it feel more like a game compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines. 1st Beat ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more after that.|$|E

Banks and Gabriel did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> the song on the album, but Hackett insisted it should be kept. It was ultimately left on after Gabriel and Banks argued {{about the length of}} [...] "The Cinema Show", which meant everything was included as a compromise.|$|E

500|$|In the end, it took Kindler and Thorpe {{seven days}} {{to write the}} episode, a {{relatively}} quick time for writing a Sanctuary episode. Because of the horror element of the episode, including the [...] "horrible" [...] fate of Jessica Mitchell, [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] was the first episode {{in the first two}} seasons Damian Kindler truly felt was not suitable for children. Also because of this, and the inclusion of an [...] "assault" [...] of a naked woman, considered taboo by the producers, Kindler did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> those scenes in any future episodes.|$|E
500|$|Deck {{building}} requires {{strategy as}} players must choose among thousands of cards which {{they want to}} play. This requires players to evaluate {{the power of their}} cards, as well as the possible synergies between them, and their possible interactions with the cards they expect to play against (this [...] "metagame" [...] can vary in different locations or time periods). The choice of cards is usually narrowed by the player deciding which colors they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> in the deck. This decision is a key part of creating a deck. In general, reducing the number of colors used increases the consistency of play and the probability of drawing the lands needed to cast one's spells, at the expense of restricting the range of tactics available to the player.|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} with IGN, both Jaffe and Barlog {{said that they}} did not view God of War II as a sequel, but rather a continuation of the previous game. Jaffe {{said that they did}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> the Roman numeral number two (II) in the title for this reason, but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an expansion pack. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason God of War II appeared on the PlayStation 2 instead of the PlayStation 3—which was released four months prior to God of War II—was because [...] "there's a 100 million people out there that will be able to play God of War II as soon as it launches." [...] Barlog assured that the game would be playable on the newer platform, which had PlayStation 2 backwards-compatibility.|$|E

500|$|After Doolittle, {{tensions}} between Deal and Francis {{came to a}} head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in Stuttgart), and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in Frankfurt. Santiago, in an interview with Mojo, described Deal as being [...] "headstrong and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> her own songs, to explore her own world" [...] on the band's albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, [...] "they kinda stopped talking". The band became increasingly tired during the post-Doolittle [...] "Fuck or Fight" [...] tour of the United States and fighting among members continued. After the tour's final date in New York City, the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus.|$|E
500|$|A {{sequel to}} God of War was first teased {{at the end}} of its credits, which stated, [...] "Kratos Will Return". God of War II was officially {{announced}} at the 2006 Game Developers Conference (GDC). David Jaffe stepped down and became the creative director of its sequel and God of Wars lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of game director. Barlog said that in the game, players would see [...] "a larger view of Kratos' role within the mythological world." [...] Like God of War, the game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine. Magic attacks became an integral part of the combat system and it was more refined. New creatures and heroes from the mythology, and more boss battles were added. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that they did not view God of War II as a sequel, but rather a continuation of the previous game. Jaffe said that they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> the Roman numeral number two (II) in the title for this reason, but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an expansion pack.

500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} concerning how many producers should receive an {{award from the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their work in producing the film. In 1999, the Academy decided that up {{to a maximum of}} three producers are eligible to be included in an award for a film. The rule was implemented to prevent a large number of involved filmmakers to appear on stage when a film was receiving an award. The Producers Guild of America (PGA) has not set a limit of producers that can be honored for a film. In the case of Little Miss Sunshine, there were five producers (Marc Turtletaub, Peter Saraf, Albert Berger, Ron Yerxa, and David Friendly) and the Academy did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> Berger and Yerxa. The two producers were responsible for finding the script, introducing the directors to the other producers, choosing the cinematographer, assisting in the re-shoot of the ending, and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival. The Academy acknowledged that the two were partners in the production process, but declared that only individual producers are recognized by the Academy. Deeming the two producers' work as a collective effort, the Academy refused to consider either Berger or Yerxa for the award. Producer David Hoberman commented on the support for honoring all five producers, stating [...] "If there are five people actually involved in producing a movie, there's no reason why someone who's made a good enough film to be nominated for an Academy Award should be precluded from being rewarded for the work they did." [...] Lynda Obst who was affiliated with an Academy Award producer committee, also commented: [...] "By and large, five people don't make a movie. If this is an exception, then it's a sad situation. But you don't destroy a rule for an exception." ...|$|E

More wide ranging and inventive than its TV equivalent... {{this is a classic}} format which might well just last as long as say, Just a Minute", [...] and Sarah Montague on Pick of the Week said of series six: [...] "Radio 4 doesn't always get comedy right, but its comedy series The Unbelievable Truth is so funny that most presenters of this programme <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> a clip". In addition, the show received the highest AI, or Appreciation Index, figures of any comedy show on Radio 4 for 2010, and has been nominated for the 2011 Sony Radio Academy Awards. It won the category of [...] "Best Radio Panel Show" [...] in the British Comedy Guide's 2011 awards.

2500|$|For {{commercial}} reasons, {{the cast}} album {{was cut from}} two LPs to one early in production. Most songs were therefore heavily abridged and several were left entirely unrecorded. According to Craig Zadan, [...] "It's generally felt that ... Prince made a mistake by giving the recording rights of Follies to Capitol Records, which in order to squeeze the unusually long score onto one disc, mutilated the songs by condensing some and omitting others." [...] Chapin confirms this: [...] "Alas ... final word came from Capitol {{that they would not}} go for two records.... now had to propose cuts throughout the score in consultation with Steve." [...] "One More Kiss" [...] was omitted from the final release but was restored for CD release. Chapin relates that [...] "there was one song that Dick Jones [...] didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> on the album but which Steve Sondheim most definitely did. The song was [...] "One More Kiss", and the compromise was that if there was time, it would be recorded, even if Jones couldn't promise it would end up on the album. (It did get recorded but didn't make its way onto the album until the CD reissue years later.)" ...|$|E
2500|$|Maeda {{leads the}} {{production}} team {{as the game}} designer {{and one of the}} scenario writers. Two additional writers include Kai, who previously contributed on the scenario of Key's 2004 game Clannad, and Leo Kashida, who had worked on the scenario of Key's 2005 game [...] and 2007 game Little Busters!. In addition to each writer being in charge of certain characters' scenarios, Maeda also supplements the scenarios written by Kai and Kashida by leading the writing in a collaborative effort. In designing the game's branching plot line and the choices the player can make, Maeda did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> choices for the player that would not have a meaningful effect, so the choices given were designed to {{have an effect on the}} plot and character interactions. Primarily based on the Angel Beats! anime, the first volume covers up to the ninth episode of the anime, including content unique to the game, before diverging into the individual character routes. The plot was designed to diverge during both special event scenes accompanied by CG artwork and normal scenes before converging again. Maeda originally wanted to make Angel Beats! a role-playing game as opposed to a visual novel adventure game, although Maeda was able to include minigames despite repeated objections from Baba. Maeda also felt that the volumes should have been released first on the PlayStation Vita.|$|E
