Regarding the theme of revenge seen throughout The Revenant, Iñárritu has stated that the approach of vengeance seen in the film needs to be significantly tempered by anyone <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to see vengeance as either an effective or useful moral to be applied in life. In the end, Iñárritu states, there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have a minor {{fight over}} Keith’s {{relationship}} with Harmony. Veronica is staying in Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Piz’s (Chris Lowell) dorm room. Piz comes in unexpectedly, {{and the two}} end up hanging out. However, a girl shows up and tells them that her boyfriend, Sully, has gone missing. They look in Sully’s room, but the girlfriend is hesitant to help. In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her {{that there are many}} people <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to frame him. Sully’s roommate comes back to their room, and Veronica uncovers that Meryl and Sully had a fight the previous weekend.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{suggested}} a plan where the encomienda would be abolished and Indians would be congregated into self-governing townships to become tribute-paying vassals of the King. He still {{suggested that the}} loss of Indian labor for the colonists could be replaced by allowing importation of African slaves. Another important part of the plan was to introduce a new kind of sustainable colonization, and Las Casas advocated supporting the migration of Spanish peasants to the Indies where they would introduce small-scale farming and agriculture, a kind of colonization that didn't rely on resource depletion and Indian labor. Las Casas worked to recruit a large number of peasants <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to travel to the Islands, where they would be given lands to farm, cash advances, and the tools and resources they needed to establish themselves there. The recruitment drive was difficult, and during the process the power relation shifted at court when Chancellor Sauvage, Las Casas's main supporter, unexpectedly died. In the end a much smaller number of peasant families were sent than originally planned, and they were supplied with insufficient provisions and no support secured for their arrival. Those who survived the journey were ill-received, and had to work hard even to survive in the hostile colonies. Las Casas was devastated by the tragic result of his peasant migration scheme, which he felt had been thwarted by his enemies. He decided instead to undertake a personal venture which would not rely on the support of others, and fought to win a land grant on the American mainland which was in its earliest stage of colonization.|$|E

25|$|Market analysts had a mixed {{response}} to the October 2016 announcement of the Nintendo Switch. Following the financially under-performing Wii U, analysts had expected that Nintendo would recognize their vulnerable position in the console market when developing their next console, believing that the company would find a means to draw back the core gamer market. Instead, initial promotion of the Switch appeared to appeal to an audience that fell between the core gamer and casual gamer markets, the latter being mobile game players <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> a more engaging experience but would {{not be willing to}} play for hours at a time, according to The New York Times. Analysts were unsure if such a market existed in large enough numbers to justify the Switch. Other concerns about the Switch's announcement were related to yet-to-be-confirmed details that could make or break the system, such as its retail price, whether the unit includes a touchscreen, the unit's battery life, and the type of games that development partners would bring to the console.|$|E
500|$|In 1940, with Britain at war {{during the}} Second World War, Baxter was {{approached}} by physicist James Chadwick, who {{asked if he could}} supply a sample of uranium hexafluoride. Baxter did so on a personal basis, using research money. Chadwick then came back and asked Baxter if he could supply a much larger amount, about [...] This time, Baxter demurred. The production of such a large quantity would require the purchase of additional equipment. ICI's hydrofluoric acid plant was out of commission and would require repairs. The bill for that amount of uranium hexafluoride would therefore come to around £3,000, a sum that he could not spend from research funds. He would require permission from senior ICI management, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to know if it would assist the war effort and whether 3 kg was all that would be required, or if further orders could be expected. Chadwick then revealed that this was part of a secret project, codenamed Tube Alloys, the object of which was to build an atomic bomb. Permission from ICI management was secured by Frederick Lindemann making a direct approach to Lord Melchett, one of ICI's directors.|$|E

500|$|Because of RCA's {{leniency}} in the end, the band's departure was peaceful despite complications, {{and they}} still hold respect for RCA for what the label allowed them to do. Heppner credits the label for allowing the record that RCA funded to go to some other company <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> it instead, while Watchorn acknowledges that recent economic troubles would have mandated that record labels only keep [...] "the {{things that are going}} to sell" [...] on their rosters. Heppner noted that labels usually shelve albums permanently if they are deemed unfit for commercial sale rather than give them to the artists who recorded them, and that the band were [...] "really, really lucky" [...] in comparison. Priestess found and signed with New York City independent record label Tee Pee Records to replace RCA in late 2009; Tee Pee Records had offered to sign the group years earlier, but the band chose RCA over Tee Pee. They enjoy being signed to Tee Pee Records rather than RCA, where they feel more [...] "at home". The band have stated that they feel less pressure to succeed on Tee Pee Records, and they do not feel any less important to the label compared to its higher-profile artists, such as American Idol contestants. [...] "Tee Pee is the perfect label for us right now, because they totally understand what we want to do," [...] Heppner stated. [...] "I am alas [...] stoked to be labelmates with so many wicked bands." [...] He additionally noted that the only advantage the band had when signed to RCA was more money, and that having a different kind of music meant that Priestess were not as lucrative as a band such as the Foo Fighters, who were more heavily promoted.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} prior to opening the Smith Center, UNC {{basketball}} played its home games in Carmichael Auditorium (now Carmichael Arena). Although Carmichael was fairly new, having opened in 1965, basketball's popularity overwhelmed the 10,180-seat facility, and [...] "you had to know somebody who knew somebody" [...] {{to get into a}} game. As early as 1979, talks began for a new arena. With the hope of accommodating every fan <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to attend a game the plans became very ambitious. Money was raised entirely from private donations, using neither university funding nor taxes. According to David Halberstam's biography of Michael Jordan, Smith did not want the arena named after him, but was persuaded by the UNC administration and the arena's backers that fundraising efforts for the facility could fail if they did not use his name. The site chosen for the arena was a wooded ravine south of the main campus, and construction began in 1982. On the first day of construction, contractors were banned from wearing Duke or N.C. State apparel on the job site.|$|E

2500|$|Wu Zetian {{was born}} into a rich family. She had {{servants}} at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers. Wu {{did not seem to be}} the type of child <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day.

At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of Emperor Taizong of Tang. It was there that she became a type of secretary.

She was given the title of cairen, title for one of the consorts with the fifth rank in Tang's nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts.
