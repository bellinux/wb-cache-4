25|$|There is {{a triple}} {{equivalence}} of categories between {{the category of}} smooth irreducible projective algebraic curves over C (with non-constant regular maps as morphisms), the category of compact Riemann surfaces (with non-constant holomorphic maps as morphisms), and {{the opposite of the}} category of algebraic function fields in one variable over C (with field homomorphisms that fix C as morphisms). This means that in studying these three subjects <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sense studying one and the same thing. It allows complex analytic methods to be used in algebraic geometry, and algebraic-geometric methods in complex analysis, and field-theoretic methods to be used in both. This is characteristic of a much wider class of problems in algebraic geometry.|$|E
25|$|Catastrophe is {{not only}} about a {{political}} situation and {{the place of the}} artist in it. The victim or “protagonist” is also representative of all actors, having to portray what writers write for them in the way directors tell them to do it (Beckett is not unaware of his own relationship with actors, particularly those who in the past have resisted his stage directions). The director in the play catches two prototypes, that of the political commissar and of the all-powerful personality director like Peter Brook, Vitez, , who bend a performance to their own interpretation, where often the victim is the author himself; there are many “in” theatrical jokes. The director’s assistant coolly carries out her instructions, and it matters little if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concentration camp or a film studio: all humane considerations are ruled out to achieve the ultimate work of art. The two-pronged metaphor is incredibly effective for all its surface simplicity. In time, as with all of Beckett’s work, more strands and allusions will be discovered.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysts {{diagnose}} uncertainty as {{the dominant}} attitude {{to life in the}} postmodern society. This uncertainty can be caused by the pressure which is executed from the society to the humans. It is the uncertainty to fail, but also the fear of their own limits, not to achieve something what the society expects, and especially the desire for recognition in all areas of life. In today's society <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> permanent competition. Appearance, occupation, education of the children - everything is compared to a media staged ideal. Everything should be perfect, because this deep-rooted aversion to all average, the pathological pursuit to excellence - these are old traditions. Who ever wants more - on the job, from the partner, from the children, from themselves - will one day be burned out and empty inside. He is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist. Who is nowadays empty inside and burned out, is in the common language a Burnout. But due to the definitional problems Burnout is till this date not a recognized illness. An attempt to define this concept more closely, can be: a condition that gets only the passionate, that is certainly not a mental illness but only a grave exhaustion (but can lead to numerous sick days). It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. This finding in turn facilitates many undetected depressed people, the way to a qualified treatment. According to experts in the field, in addition to the ultra hard-working and the idealists mainly the perfectionist, the loner, the grim and the thin-skinned are especially endangered of a burnout. All together they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work.|$|E
25|$|Pessimism bias <b>is</b> <b>an</b> effect <b>in</b> {{which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that negative things will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias.

500|$|The {{concluding}} {{portion of}} the book includes a comparison of Werner Erhard's methodologies to Zen, The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda, and to Rhinehart's views from The Dice Man. Drawing a parallel to the [...] "controlled folly" [...] described in Castaneda's A Separate Reality, Rhinehart argues that in almost all cases, enlightenment is linked to humor: [...] "One can rarely have an enlightenment experience except under the impact of nonsense ... Every time we laugh <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way experiencing a mini enlightenment, a tiny letting go of some attachment to some bit of belief or sense. Full enlightenment, in these terms, is accepting what is, which leads to experiencing fully whatever one is experiencing." ...|$|E

The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

500|$|December {{started with}} the last group stage match of the UEFA Cup. Benfica visited Beveren and won 3-0 with a double from Zlatko Zahovič, {{ensuring}} qualification for the round of 32 behind Stuttgart. On 6 December, Benfica received Estoril. The visitors scored first, but Benfica responded through Simão with a double inside ten minutes, giving them the first league win in a month and returning them to first place. On 12 December, Benfica played away to Belenenses. Trapattoni's team did not perform to expectations and lost 4–1, the largest defeat there since 1947–48. Trapattoni remained optimistic, saying, [...] "Losing a game like this is not catastrophic. Give up? No, that is not my vocabulary." [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} defeat, José Moreira lost his starting goalkeeping place to Quim. Trapattoni, in the preview for the upcoming match with Penafiel, said, [...] "Benfica needs to forget this humiliating defeat quickly. Four goals...three goals in eight minutes, it is true <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of emergency. We have the mentality to react and will do so." [...] On the same day, Benfica discovered their next opponent in the UEFA Cup would be CSKA Moscow. On 18 December, Benfica beat Penafiel 1–0 with a goal from Argel. On 21 December, Benfica played the last game of the year, hosting third-tier team AD Oliveirense for the Portuguese Cup. Benfica won 4–1 but required extra time to beat the visitors after a 1-1 draw in regular time. Throughout the game, Benfica fans whistled the team for the poor game. Later, Trapattoni acknowledged the performance, saying, [...] "For the first time, I am with the fans since the team deserved the whistles." ...|$|E

The four created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, [...] "I’m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers.

[...] "I think since we already are in that world, about 70 percent of the Navy's IT infrastructure, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world where the Navy has complete control and authority over how we operate the network. That has allowed us to maintain extremely high degree of security, which is frankly our number one issue. The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from. To that note, what have we done to lessen blow in future? I think the answer is we don't need to because we are already there." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} aspect of Owen Glendower are historical parallels between {{the beginning of the}} fifteenth century and the late 1930s and early 1940s: [...] "A sense of contemporataneousnees is ever present in Owen Glendower. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world of change like our own".

In the [...] "Argument" [...] that prefaced the (American) first edition of 1941, Powys comments [...] "the beginning of the fifteenth century [...] saw the beginning of one of the most momentous and startling epochs of transition that the world has known".

2500|$|Rodriguez {{made his}} 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 {{on the same}} day MLB {{announced}} he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, {{for his role in the}} Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> litigious environment.
