5|$|When Kerry Collins made {{it known}} {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the Giants until they {{eventually}} demoted him for Manning, the Giants released Collins. They later signed quarterback Kurt Warner, to serve as the interim quarterback until Manning was deemed ready to play. Warner had led the St. Louis Rams to two Super Bowls, winning one of them. However, Warner had been affected by injuries, specifically a broken hand, which reduced his effectiveness and led to his release by the Rams.|$|E
5|$|During his loan spell at Millwall, Doyle had {{suggested}} he might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{with the club}} on a permanent basis, despite the offer of a new contract from his parent club. However, {{at the end of}} the season he signed a two-year deal with Birmingham. Because Vaesen's contract had expired, there was an expectation that Doyle would step up to second-choice goalkeeper behind Maik Taylor. Doyle played his first competitive match for Birmingham in their League Cup first-round match against Shrewsbury Town on 22 August 2006, in which he kept a clean sheet as his club won 1–0. With Taylor injured, Doyle made his first league appearance for Birmingham four days later in a 2–0 defeat away to Cardiff City. Doyle played in the second and third rounds of the League Cup, against Wrexham and Sheffield United, before losing his place in the cup team to Taylor for the quarter-final defeat to Liverpool.|$|E

They know that they must purchase jet fuel {{for as long as they}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in business, and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their fuel requirements (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

25|$|After {{the bike}} shop closes, Mark decides {{to move to}} Minnesota. Becky decides to go with him, and they elope. Jackie and Roseanne each get a check for $10,000 from their mother after she and their father divorce. They, along with Nancy, decide to open a diner but can only get the money they need after Bev agrees to become a partner as well. Nancy comes out as a lesbian. The Tildens, a single father and his two daughters around Becky and Darlene's ages (Wings Hauser, Mara Hobel, Danielle Harris), move in next door. Jackie dates Fisher (Matt Roth), a much younger man. When Roseanne discovers he is {{physically}} abusive, Dan confronts him, beats him up, and is arrested. Roseanne and Jackie's father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress only to find her father blamed his daughters for his abuse towards them. Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie (Joan Collins) visits and persuades Darlene to get her GED and apply to art school. David applies as well. Darlene asks her parents if David can move in, because his mother is moving away and they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because {{it reminded her of}} her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father. Roger (Tim Curry) offers Dan a deal to renovate and sell a small fixer-upper house, then runs off before the deal is complete; Jackie decides to buy the house, saving Dan from financial ruin. David gets a rejection letter from art school, while Darlene gets an acceptance. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing she was wrong, Roseanne persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals just to stay with David.|$|E

He added his participation in the reality television series was for [...] "fun", and stating: [...] "I still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at Hollyoaks and progress in my career there" [...] {{because he did not}} think he was a good enough actor to pursue other projects.

Richardson stated: [...] "Marquess loved everything I've been doing and wanted to keep me on. I'm hoping to stick with the show no matter what." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Royal Highness is not enraged at SpongeBob and Patrick for popping the bubble, {{telling him}} that the one they popped was just a prop for the tourists. He then shows them the real oldest living bubble, which Patrick then takes a picture of, causing it to pop. Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to attack, but the gang manage to escape. Just when they escape outside, Plankton comes in and tries to destroy them with the tank he found, but much to his dismay, it showers the group with ice cream.

500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} and a half years of playing Daphne, Smith decided to leave Neighbours and asked to be written out. She felt that while Daphne had been [...] "a bit of a {{challenge}} at first", she felt trapped by her persona. Smith also believed that the role no longer offered her variety and she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> to be bored, but comfortable. As Daphne was one of Neighbours most popular characters, the producers chose not to kill her off. Instead Daphne's father, Allen (Neil Fitzpatrick), re-entered her life and told her he was dying. Realising that she only had a short time to make her peace with him, Daphne took Jamie and moved away to nurse Allen. Viewers were not satisfied with this ending for the character, especially as it meant Daphne and Des would have to break up, a situation that they would not accept.|$|E

500|$|Overmars enjoyed further {{success in}} the 1994–95 season. Ajax {{retained}} the league and won the UEFA Champions League, beating Milan in the final.

It's not special any more. I think the Champions' League is just a starter for {{what they want to do}} in the future, create a European League." [...] Overmars' exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England. He knew of Arsenal's interest, but was puzzled as to why a move [...] "didn't work out." [...] In the summer of 1995, he was linked with a move to Manchester United, but said, [...] "No thanks I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with Ajax for two more seasons." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order that}} Hershiser {{and the rest}} of the staff could have their normal number of days of rest heading into the playoff series that could start as early as October 3, Hershiser pitched on only three days rest rather than making his regular start on September 24. The Dodgers entered the game with an 89–63 record and an 8-game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds, while the San Francisco Giants were 10.5 games back in fourth place in the {{division}} with a 79–74 record entering the game. With the September 23 win, the Dodgers retained an 8-game lead over the Reds. The victory reduced the Dodgers' magic number to two. The game marked Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout, which stretched his consecutive scoreless inning streak to 49. Following the game, Hershiser was quoted as saying [...] "I want to keep putting zeroes up there [...] not because of the streak, but for the team...I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> hot right up through the playoffs." ...|$|E
