5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that the sacrifices {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} {{that she needed to}} readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E
5|$|With Ujung Kulon as {{the last}} resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an {{advantage}} over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, because any catastrophic diseases or tsunamis could wipe them all out at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. The banteng cattle also compete with the rhinos for food, so the authorities were considering plans to fence off {{the western part of}} the park to keep the livestock out.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{served in}} the United States Marine Corps in the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit from 1977-1983. His final rank was Sergeant (E-5). While serving in the military, he became good friends with fellow Marine Knowle Rohrer. From 1982-1983, Doggett {{played a role in}} the Multi-National Peacekeeping Force for Lebanon development. Doggett retired from the U.S. Marine Corps with commendations after being wounded in the line of duty. After gaining a Juris Doctor and a Master's degree in Public Administration from Syracuse University, Doggett went on to work for the New York Police Department from 1987–1995, {{eventually}} becoming a detective in the Fugitive Division's Warrant section. While he was working for the NYPD, his son, Luke Doggett (played in flashbacks by Jake Fritz), was abducted and murdered. Doggett teamed up with Special Agent Monica Reyes, who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> of the New York FBI field office at the time, to search for his son's killer. After his son's death, Doggett's marriage to Barbara Doggett (played by Patrick's real-life wife Barbara) ended in divorce.|$|E

5|$|In Constantinople, Allied {{military}} representatives {{pushed to}} threaten the Ottoman government for the affair, while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a modus vivendi with Kemal. The Allied Supreme Council, {{which at the time}} <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> the details to a peace treaty that it would present to the Ottoman government, deliberated on how best to respond. Some of the delegates present, including Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, insisted that strong pressure should be brought to bear against the Ottoman government to prevent new atrocities, but the other diplomats were skeptical of the idea. The officials also agreed that the Ottoman government should dismiss Kemal from office, although they admitted that such a move was impractical, since the Ottoman government held no control over Kemal, who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia. A decision was finally reached on 10 March. British, French and Italian leaders agreed to authorize the formal occupation of Constantinople, which was carried out by the forces under General George F. Milne's command on the morning of 16 March.|$|E

25|$|When Xiang {{learned of}} the Comintern’s {{decision}} on anti-rightism, he claimed that the Chinese revolution was in its peak period. Li turned this blindness into extremism, which was later known as the Li Lisan line, calling for armed uprising in the cities and extension of revolution to whole country. From June 1930, the Li Lisan line matured under the support from Xiang. The CCP gave up the daily operation from its headquarters, turning it over to divisions in all provinces. It set up action committees in all provinces, and began preparing for a full-scale uprising in October. But the Comintern expressed its discontent by stating that it <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>out</b> systemic policies for Chinese revolution, and that the CCP should concentrate instead on the uprising in one or several provinces instead. Xiang stood by Li, both refuting that it was zero hour of Chinese revolution. In several rounds of discussion, the tension between Xiang, Li, and the Comintern rose greatly. The suspicion and criticism by the CCP towards the Comintern {{was the same as}} betrayal {{in the eyes of the}} Comintern.|$|E

[...] In 1989, Pacino faced a $6 million lawsuit from producer Elliott Kastner. Kastner claimed Pacino had gone back on an agreement to star in his version of a Carlito movie with Marlon Brando as criminal lawyer David Kleinfeld.

2500|$|... 1616 – Prince Drian-Ramaka, {{having been}} renamed [...] "Dom André de Souza" [...] (Sahavandra?) by the Jesuits, {{returned}} to Anosy in April, together with 8 [...] "white companions," [...] 3 of them Jesuit missionaries whose {{task was to}} develop a mission at Tranovato by working in collaboration with [...] "Dom Andre" [...] and his Raondriana father. While his parents were very happy when they found out their son, who had been forcibly taken from them two years earlier, was not only alive and aboard a ship in Ranofotsy bay, the Jesuits refused to let [...] "Dom Andre" [...] go to shore until his father provided two additional relatives as temporary hostages. While King Chambanga was enraged over this, he did eventually yield to this demand. These temporary hostages were chained up on the ship and then the Jesuits indicated they would take Drian-Ramaka back on board as well unless his father provided them with another son (preferably two), who would also be taken to Goa for studies. However, Chambanga refused to give up any of his sons to the Jesuits, including Drian-Ramaka. Furthermore, he told the Jesuit missionaries [...] "he felt the Portuguese had the custom of sending some missionaries first to lands they desired and following later to take possession" [...] of them (Larson, 2007). This in turn enraged the Jesuits and the ship's company, who plotted to mercilessly battle the king and his followers, only giving up on this plan when they realized in so doing they {{would not be able to}} do any missionary work in Anosy. Eventually the Jesuits worked out an agreement with Chambanga that in exchange for [...] "just" [...] taking one of what had been two temporary Antanosy hostages to Goa for education, they would be allowed to live and do their missionary work in Anosy. Two of the missionaries settled at Tranovato (for a 1656 map of this community drawn by Flacourt, see.). However, when members of this new, Portuguese community identified the ombiasa as God's enemies, in return the ombiasa threatened to poison them. When the Portuguese openly began searching for gold and silver in the Anosy area, this confirmed King Chambanga's fears that they were involved in much more than just sharing their religion with his people. Soon after this the Portuguese living at Tranovato became ill due to fevers and by the end of the year, very frustrated with how this vazaha endeavor <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>out,</b> Chambanga forbid his people to provide anything to the Portuguese in an attempt to starve them into leaving Anosy.|$|E
