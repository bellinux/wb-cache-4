5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were confident that he stood some chance of recovery, but were doubtful that he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> able to play football again.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E

5|$|Gilberto's doctor {{ordered him}} to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the {{fractured}} bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil {{for the duration of}} his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult 2004–05 season ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

25|$|When Vinny Milano was {{repeatedly}} asked, via Twitter, whether the Creatures would still include Alex Rodriguez in the roll call despite his recent struggles and suspension, Milano insisted that A-Rod {{will still be}} part of the roll call and that no Yankee <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> intentionally skipped.|$|E
25|$|Many {{schools in}} New Jersey {{closed for the}} day, evacuated, or were locked-down. The {{destruction}} of 30% (28.7 million sq ft) of Lower Manhattan office space accelerated the pre-2001 trend of moving jobs from Lower Manhattan to Midtown and New Jersey. Many questioned whether this loss of jobs and its associated tax base <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> restored.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} discussions in whether Benoit <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame. Steve Austin commented on Benoit, believing {{that while he was}} an important aspect of the business, he would never be {{inducted into the}} Hall of Fame due to his actions. Chris Jericho also stated that Benoit should never be in the Hall of Fame.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, {{that the}} magistrates cannot try the question," [...] said the archdeacon; [...] "they only hear the primary evidence.

60|$|So great was his activity, that I {{doubt whether}} the new church <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>been</b> finished, had not the wardens and the vestry men insisted that Mr. Drone must take a holiday, and sent him on the Mackinaw trip up the lakes,--the only foreign travel of the Dean's life.|$|R
25|$|It is {{doubtful}} that Subhas Chandra Bose envisaged the Free India Legion <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> an army sufficient or strong enough to conduct an effective campaign across Persia into India on its own. Instead, the IR 950 {{was to become a}} pathfinder, preceding a larger Indo-German force in a Caucasian campaign into the western frontiers of British India, that would encourage public resentment of the Raj and incite the British Indian Army into revolt.|$|E
25|$|Just before Harvey died he was {{planning}} to star and direct two films, one on Kitty Genovese, the other a Wolf Mankowitz comedy called Cockatrice. Harvey's death in 1973 ultimately put an end to any hope that Orson Welles's The Deep <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> completed. With Harvey and Jeanne Moreau in the leading roles, Welles worked on the film in between his other projects, although the production was also hampered by financial problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{justification}} for razing the West End {{has also been}} called into question. Some say that, {{as one of the}} neighborhoods that supported the former mayor, it was in the political sights of the Hynes administration. The entire net cost of the project was $15.8 million, not including the additional loss of tax dollars for the years that the West End was vacant. It is uncertain as to whether the increased tax revenue <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> enough to justify the costs.|$|E

50|$|In the meantime, Julia has {{married an}} older and wealthy suitor, whom she flaunts on a rather nerve-wracking visit to Lynton's.

25|$|During July 1960, {{following}} {{the revolution in}} Cuba, La Sonora Matancera was on tour in Mexico when the band members decided to settle in the United States. Castro vowed {{that none of the}} artists <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> allowed back to Cuba. Celia Cruz attempted to return when her mother died in 1962, but was not granted government permission. Cruz became a US citizen in 1961 and a year later married Sonora's trumpet player Pedro Knight, who became her manager and musical director.|$|E
25|$|The Bergen Mall, {{which was}} fully {{enclosed}} in 1973, was first planned in 1955 by Allied Stores to have 100 stores and 8,600 parking spaces in a 1.5 million ft² mall {{that would include}} a ² Stern's store and two other ² department stores {{as part of the}} initial design. Allied's chairman B. Earl Puckett confidently announced The Bergen Mall as the largest of ten proposed centers, stating that there were 25 cities that could support such centers and that no more than 50 malls of this type <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> built nationwide.|$|E
25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations that <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> needed in this country could {{be done on the}} three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May Haig {{thought the}} Germans “uncannily quiet”. At Abbeville (2 May) {{it was agreed}} that in the event of renewed attack British forces would retreat south if {{necessary}} and abandon the Channel Ports rather than lose touch with the French.

50|$|Many {{scholars}} {{maintain that}} no letter actually known to <b>be</b> pseudepigraphical <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>been</b> {{admitted to the}} New Testament canon. Other scholars suggest that the church did not develop its hard line against pseudepigraphy until the practice was being abused. Some works that were definite forgeries led to a rejection of any sort of pseudepigraphy.|$|R
25|$|On 22 December 1845, Peder Ludvig Møller, {{who studied}} at the University of Copenhagen {{at the same time}} as Kierkegaard, {{published}} an article indirectly criticizing Stages on Life's Way. The article complimented Kierkegaard for his wit and intellect, but questioned whether he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> able to master his talent and write coherent, complete works. Møller was also a contributor to and editor of The Corsair, a Danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing. Kierkegaard published a sarcastic response, charging that Møller's article was merely an attempt to impress Copenhagen's literary elite.|$|E
25|$|While {{directing}} The Outlaw, Hughes became {{fixated on}} a small flaw in one of Jane Russell's blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. Richard Fleischer, who directed His Kind of Woman with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty {{of dealing with the}} tycoon. In his book, Just Tell Me When to Cry, Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> completed.|$|E
25|$|Although A Troll in Central Park {{was closer}} to completion, Merlin and Media Assets decided that Thumbelina {{was more likely to}} be a {{commercial}} success, and pressed for its completion and release first. MGM/UA, who planned to distribute the films in the US, had already backed off in the wake of DBE's bankruptcy, doubtful that the pictures <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> completed. J Entertainment, which was slated to release the films overseas, sold their rights to Media Assets. Warner Bros. picked up Thumbelina and subsequent films for worldwide distribution. The film was released in March 1994. Critical reception was generally indifferent to mixed, and the film performed poorly at the box office, grossing US$11.4M.|$|E
