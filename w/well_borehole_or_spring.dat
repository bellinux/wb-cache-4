30|$|In {{the complex}} floodplain–Barind {{geologic}} {{environment of the}} Chapai-Nawabganj area, the need for costly random drilling, resulting in dry holes or marginal production from wells can largely be eliminated by the judicious application of low-cost geoelectrical studies. Two inherent electrical properties of the earth materials viz. geoelectrical resistance (R) and the total resistivity (A) of the aquifer are easy to measure by conducting VES experiments. These two properties of aquifer materials have functionally analogous relation with the T and K, respectively. These are T = 0.3079 × R + 299.81 and K = 0.3712 × A - 7.3727. These equations were also authenticated by estimating aquifer parameters at some locations where pumping test information is not available. It is notwithstanding that the linear lines indicate a minor discrepancy over the transverse resistance and aquifer total resistivity. Therefore, it can be applied in geologically similar area where any information relating to pumping <b>well</b> <b>or</b> <b>borehole</b> available for {{the identification of the}} potential groundwater bearing horizon.|$|R

Typically the water level drawdown was recorded after 24  h of pumping to allow stabilisation of the water level and development of a cone of depression. Shorter time periods are not considered reliable. The specific capacity range of the alluvials and weathered/fractured rock are 129 – 4089  m 3 /h/m and 186 – 11, 640  m 3 /h/m respectively. The specific capacity data indicates that alluvials can have nearly three times the potential of bores in the weathered and fractured rock aquifers [37]. This {{is in contrast to}} the yield information, but likely is a better reflection of the actual potential which is related to the thickness of the water bearing zone. This effectively links to aquifer types limiting the usefulness of the data. However assessment of the transmissivity from the data is considered reliable enough for providing a general basin wide estimate of aquifers potential.|$|R

50|$|Salt {{is made in}} {{two ways}} traditionally. Rock salt is mined from the ground. The other type known as white salt is made by the {{evaporation}} of brine. Brine is obtained in several ways. Wild brine streams, occurring from the natural solution of rock salt by ground water, {{can come to the}} surface as natural brine <b>springs</b> <b>or</b> can be pumped up to the surface at <b>well,</b> shafts <b>or</b> <b>boreholes.</b> Artificial brine is obtained through solution mining of rock salt with fresh water and is known as ‘controlled brine pumping’. A Bastard Brine used to be made by allowing fresh water to run through abandoned rock salt mines. A Salt-on-Salt process strengthens brine by dissolving rock salt, and/ or, crystal salt in weak brine or sea water prior to evaporation. Solar Evaporation uses the sun to strengthen and evaporate sea water trapped on the sea-shore to make sea salt crystals, or to strengthen and evaporate brine sourced from natural springs where it is made into white salt crystals.|$|R

40|$|With {{significant}} {{climate change}} predicted in Africa {{over the next}} century, this chapter explores a key question: how will rural water supplies in Africa be affected? Approximately 550 million people in Africa live in rural communities and are reliant on water resources {{within walking distance of}} their community for drinking water. Less than half have access to improved sources (generally large diameter <b>wells,</b> <b>springs,</b> <b>or</b> <b>boreholes</b> equipped with handpumps); the majority rely on unimproved sources, such as open water and shallow wells. Major climate modelling uncertainties, combined with rapid socio-economic change, make predicting the future state of African water resources difficult; an appropriate response to climate change is to assume much greater uncertainty in climate and intensification of past climate variability. Based on this assumption the following should be considered: 1. Those relying on unimproved water sources (300 million in rural Africa) are likely to be most affected by climate change because unimproved sources often use highly vulnerable water resources. 2. Improved rural water supplies in Africa are overwhelmingly dependent on groundwater, due to the unreliability of other sources. 3. Climate change is unlikely to lead to continent-wide failure of improved rural water sources that acces...|$|R
