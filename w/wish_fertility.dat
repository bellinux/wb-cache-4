40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the success rates of sclerotherapy of the tunica vaginalis with alcohol {{for the treatment}} of hydroceles and/or spermatoceles, as well as, evaluation of pain, formation of hematomas, infection and its effects in spermatogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 69 patients, with offsprings and diagnosis of hydrocele and/or spermatocele, were treated during the period from April 2003 to June 2007. Semen analysis was obtained from patients who were able to provide us with samples. The sclerotherapy with alcohol at 99. 5 % was undertaken as outpatient procedure. RESULTS: The average volume drained pre-sclerotherapy was 279. 82 mL (27 to 1145). The median follow-up was 43 months (9 to 80). A total of 114 procedures were performed on 84 units, with an average of 1. 35 procedures / unit and an overall success rate of 97. 62 %. Of the 69 patients, 7 (10. 14 %) reported minor pain immediately after the procedure, 3 (4. 35 %) moderate pain and 2 (2. 89 %) intense pain. Post-Sclerotherapy spermograms revealed reduction of the parameters regarding: concentration, motility and morphology up to 6 months post procedure, with return to normal parameters 12 th months after procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Sclerotherapy of hydroceles and spermatoceles with 99. 5 % alcohol is an efficient procedure that can be perormed without difficulties, cost-effectiveness, with few side effects and which may be performed in patients who <b>wish</b> <b>fertility...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundRadical {{hysterectomy}} is {{the standard}} treatment for patients with early-stage cervical cancer. However, for women who <b>wish</b> to preserve <b>fertility,</b> radical trachelectomy is a safe and viable option. ObjectiveTo present the first case of laparoscopic radical trachelectomy performed in the National Cancer Institute, and published in Mexico. Clinical casePatient, 34 years old, gravid 1, caesarean 1, stage IB 1 cervical cancer, squamous, <b>wishing</b> to preserve <b>fertility.</b> She underwent a laparoscopic radical trachelectomy and bilateral dissection of the pelvic lymph nodes. Operation time was 330 min, and the estimated blood loss was 100 ml. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The final pathology reported a tumour of 15 mm with infiltration of 7 mm, surgical margins without injury, and pelvic nodes without tumour. After a 12 month follow-up, the patient is having regular periods, but has not yet tried to get pregnant. No evidence of recurrence. ConclusionsLaparoscopic radical trachelectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is a safe alternative in young patients who <b>wish</b> to preserve <b>fertility</b> with early stage cervical cancer...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: There {{are only}} 26 cases of {{borderline}} ovarian clear cell adenofibroma {{reported in the}} literature. Most of these were diagnosed on salpingo-oophorectomy specimens in postmenopausal women presenting with a pelvic mass.

30|$|In {{cases of}} stage IA 2 tumors, fertility-sparing {{procedures}} include cervical conization with laparoscopic (or extraperitoneal) pelvic lymphadenectomy, ART, VRT, or laparoscopic trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. For women not <b>wishing</b> to preserve <b>fertility,</b> pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed along with modified radical hysterectomy or more radical surgery. In low-risk cases, adequate surgical treatment may comprise simple hysterectomy or trachelectomy, with either pelvic lymphadenectomy or SLNB [26].|$|R
30|$|Introduction: About 30 - 50 % {{women with}} myomas warrant {{treatment}} for symptomatic relief. Laparoscopic Myomectomy {{is an option}} for the ones who <b>wish</b> to preserve <b>fertility.</b> Several options have been considered for reducing blood loss during myomectomy. Intralesional vasopressin remains the agent of choice, however, it requires stringent intra-operative monitoring considering its side-effects. Other agents like Oxytocin, Misoprostol, Uterine Ligation have been tried but not found as effective.|$|R
30|$|As a rule, {{uterine artery}} {{embolization}} has been {{low on the}} list of treatment options for intractable uterine hemorrhage in women of reproductive age who <b>wish</b> to preserve <b>fertility</b> because of fear that the uterine vasculature may be permanently altered and compromise fertility and pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it is thought that UAE may result in abnormal placentation in future pregnancies resulting in miscarriages, premature births or placenta previa, accreta, and increta.|$|R

40|$|Contraceptive {{choice and}} {{discontinuation}} are poorly understood among HIV-positive women, and HIV disease and culture may influence decisions. We assessed factors influencing contraceptive decision-making among HIV-positive women in three countries. This qualitative assessment of 108 HIV-positive women (36 /site, selected {{by age and}} parity strata) was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Kericho, Kenya; and Soweto, South Africa. Freelist interviews assessed knowledge and attitudes towards contraception and were analyzed enumerating frequency and saliency of mentions. There was intersite consensus around list items but priority and themes varied. Site-specific factors influencing contraceptive choice were male partner <b>wishes</b> and <b>fertility</b> desire (Brazil), side-effects (South Africa), and impact on health and HIV progression (Kenya). Age, parity, and taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) impacted some themes. Contraceptive use among HIV-positive women is substantially influenced by culture and other factors.

40|$|Epithelial {{ovarian cancer}} (EOC) {{continues}} to represent {{one of the}} most lethal conditions in women in the western countries.

Next to the optimal therapeutic treatment strategies, gynecologic oncologists are being asked to incorporate into their decision-making processes the patients' <b>wish</b> for <b>fertility</b> preserving alternatives ideally without compromising oncologic safety. Nowadays, fertility-sparing surgery represents an effective alternative to conventional radical cytoreduction in younger women with early stages of the disease. As such, this paper considers indications for fertility sparing surgery in EOC, reflects on outcomes from the oncologic and reproductive data {{of the largest and most}} relevant series outcomes data, reporting on fertility sparing techniques in EOC, reviews medicamentous efforts to prevent chemotherapy induced gonadotoxicity, and discusses future aspects in the gynecologic cancer management...|$|R

40|$|Fertility {{preservation}} {{for cancer}} patients {{is a relatively}} new field in medicine which requires interdisciplinary approach. Improving therapies and rising survival rates require to consider patient’s quality of life after cancer is cured which is relevant personal issue regardless of the individual income and the level of development of the country of origin. Fertility preservation offers possible solution but also raises ethical questions. We provide a summary of ethical principles embodied in professional guidelines together with options and restrictions to access fertility preservation in developing countries. We also make a suggestion that oncofertility counselling could be a pillar to address fertility preservation issues in cancer patients. Our proposed decisional support model is patient centred and focuses on patient values, personal philosophy and view of life emphasizing sensitivity to individual patient’s needs and <b>wishes.</b> Some <b>fertility</b> preservation concerns in oncology might be addressed mirroring already available expertise while some others will call for innovative and region specific solutions.

30|$|Treatment for benign struma is {{surgical}} resection. Hence, {{for women}} <b>wishing</b> to retain <b>fertility,</b> unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy {{may still be}} a feasible option {{in the absence of}} extracapsular extension and distant metastases [44]. As the few reported imaging features of ovarian struma overlap with those of other lesions, such as ovarian carcinoma, it becomes all the more relevant to be aware of contemporary imaging findings, including state-of-the-art MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging, in order to attempt preoperative diagnosis in these challenging and complex lesions. Failure to characterise this rare and usually benign mass as benign may lead to surgical overtreatment when ovarian cancer type surgery (including bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy, omentectomy and occasionally appendectomy) is performed.|$|R

30|$|Young {{women with}} early Stage I disease who <b>wish</b> to {{preserve}} <b>fertility</b> can be offered fertility preserving surgery or trachelectomy. In this procedure, the tumour-bearing cervix is removed and the uterine body is re-anastomsed to the vagina with insertion of a cerclage suture to maintain isthmic competency during pregnancy [76]. An important criterion for surgery {{is that the}} proximal end of the tumour should be 1  cm or more distal to the internal os to permit tumour-free re-anastomosis. This cannot be reliably determined clinically by the examining gynaecologist, and MRI {{has been shown to}} be a reliable method of predicting involvement of the internal os by tumour, with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 96 % [77], making MRI essential when considering trachelectomy.|$|R

30|$|Approximately 138 {{million women}} of {{reproductive}} age have had tubal sterilization, {{and there is}} evidence that increasingly younger women are being sterilized [2]. Tubal sterilization was performed on many young women in Turkey during their third Cesarean section. In our clinic, we perform tubal sterilization according to a scoring system [3], because this system decreases the number of women who desire the reversal of tubal sterilization. It is estimated that 2 – 13 % of women develop post-sterilization regret, leading in 1 – 3 % to an operative reversal procedure [4]. The indications for reversal of sterilization are generally a change in marital status and death of children and, rarely, a desire for more children or children of different gender, <b>wish</b> to regain <b>fertility,</b> and religious and psychological factors.|$|R
30|$|Because most {{patients}} with benign cystic teratoma are of reproductive age and <b>wish</b> to preserve <b>fertility,</b> a conservative approach is ideal to minimize postoperative adhesions and decrease {{the chances of}} compromised fertility [4].

In our study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic management of benign cystic teratoma, and we now present some guidelines and tips to improve results of surgery and avoid possible complications that may result from cyst spillage. We also demonstrate {{that the use of}} an endobag creates satisfactory and easy removal of cysts; however, removal without an impermeable bag gives the same safety and results if certain guidelines are followed.|$|R

40|$|Background: Uterine Tumors Resembling Ovarian Sex Cord Tumors (UTROSCT) {{are rare}} tumors of low malignancy. In the past, these tumors were mainly treated by hysterectomy.

The age and prevalence of those with cervical carcinoma diagnosed and missed by conization were determined. ResultsOf the 248 patients, 11 cases (4. 4 %) of cervical carcinoma were missed by cervical conization. The age of those with cervical carcinoma missed by conization was significantly greater than those whose diagnosis was not missed (p < 0. 05). ConclusionWomen with severe cervical dysplasia who no longer <b>wish</b> to preserve <b>fertility</b> should be advised to undergo hysterectomy if the conization margins are not free of disease.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the fourth most common cancer in women {{worldwide}} [1].

However, those radical procedures have significant morbidity, mainly {{as a result of}} the removal of the parametria. The parametrectomy is the most challenging part of the procedure and major complications have been reported such as blood loss, bladder and rectal dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and fistula formation [7 - 12].

It is also recommended to refer women expeditiously to a fertility specialist in order to improve counseling. Women’s age, diagnosis, presence of male partner, time available and preferences regarding use of donor sperm influence the selection of the appropriate fertility preservation option.
