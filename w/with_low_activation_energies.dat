40|$|AbstractAnthocyanin is {{considered}} as an unstable pigment, undergoes gradual degradation processes throughout the storage or use. The degradation of Rosella anthocyanin extract (RAE) in different pH solutions was studied under solar light and compared with solutions {{kept in the}} dark. It appears that RAE solutions under solar light were suffering rapid degradation than those kept in the dark. Moreover, RAE samples at higher pH values showed faster rates of degradation than those with lower pH values. A mechanism for degradation was suggested through the formation of hydroxyl radical {{which is responsible for}} demineralization process. It is also appears that as the initial concentration of the dye increases, the requirement needed for degradation increased as well.

We discuss a recently developed network-rebonding model involving bonding rearrangements of silicon and hydrogen atoms.

Major experimental features of metastability including electron-spin resonance, t 1 = 3 kinetics, dangling-bond H anti-correlation, and hysteretic annealing are explained. In the second part we focus on large metastable structural changes observed in a-Si:H. We find H atoms have a local metastability involving the flipping of the H to the backside of the Si–H bond that results in a local increase of strain and increase of dipole moments.

Low temperature transport (< 4 K) exhibits also strong nonlinearity of a breakdown type characterized in particular by S-shaped I-V curve.

40|$|Interdiffusion {{parameters}} are often extracted from depth {{profiles of the}} interface of annealed thin films by measuring the annealing time of the sample {{as well as the}} distance over which interdiffusion took place. The annealing time is usually taken as the time from the moment the sample enters the oven to the exact moment the sample is removed from the oven. However, diffusion does not start and stop at these points, as the temperature of the sample does not change instantaneously. Any calculation performed with the instantaneous and therefore erroneous time will result in incorrect diffusion parameters extracted from the depth profiles. The influence of the extended heating period is studied by solving Fick's second law numerically and employing three distinct heating profiles in the calculations, namely instantaneous, actual, and linear. The results indicate a clear difference between the first two calculated depth profiles. Using these calculations and some experimental results, a method that employs linear heating and cooling of a sample is proposed for studying the interdiffusion of fast diffusing elements (<b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies).</b> Diffusion parameters, thin films, interdiffusion calculations, diffusion profile...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{timescale}} Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (DDT) {{has been}} shown to occur through the generation of compression waves emitted by a hot spot or reaction centre where the pressure and temperature increase with little diminution of density. In order to compensate for the multi-scale nature of the physico-chemical processes, previous numerical simulations in this area have been limited to relatively small activation energies. In this work, a computational study investigates the effect of increased activation energy on the time required to form a detonation wave and the change in behaviour of each hot spot as the activation energy is increased. The simulations use a localised spatially distributed thermal power deposition of limited duration into a finite volume of reactive gas to facilitate DDT. The Adaptive Wavelet-Collocation Method is used to solve efficiently the 1 -D reactive Euler equations with one-step Arrhenius kinetics. The DDT process as described in previous work is characterised by the formation of hot spots during an initial transient period, explosion of the hot spots and creation of an accelerating reaction front that reaches the lead shock and forms an overdriven detonation wave. Current results indicate that as the activation energy is raised the chemical heat release becomes more temporally distributed. Hot spots that produce an accelerating reaction front <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> change behaviour with increased activation energy so that no accelerating reaction front is created.

40|$|Chemists and {{chemical}} engineers seek to utilize zeolites 'under control' in heterogeneously catalyzed reactions. By choosing specific zeolite structures, channel and cage geometry can be varied, which can strongly influence the activity and selectivity in chemical transformations. Brønsted and Lewis acid sites initiate catalytic reactions via proton transfer or hydride abstraction, and negatively charged framework oxygen can stabilize formed hydrocarbon cations. These multiple active centers of zeolites {{can work together}} to promote a desired reaction process. By ion-exchange of parent zeolites, the formation of Brønsted acid sites follows the Hirschler-Plank mechanism upon thermal dehydration of these zeolites at temperatures higher than 473 K. Increasing the dehydration temperatures, the concentration of Brønsted acid sites is decreasing. At the same time, highly charged metal cations are formed in this process acting as Lewis acid sites, and bridging OH groups are deprotonated to generate basic sites. The strength of these Lewis acid sites depends on the ratio between the charge of the metal cation and its size. These active sites show different performance at {{the early stages of}} acid catalyzed reactions.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{calculation}} of the non-equilibrium composition in a SF 6 thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure. Non-equilibrium thermal plasmas are characterized by heavy species temperatures Th below 9000 K with electron temperatures at the maximum three times higher than Th when the latter is below 4000 K. Different theories have been used based on either multi-temperature plasmas, Saha-Potapov modified by André et al, van de Sanden et al, Cliteur et al, or kinetic calculations or the pseudo-equilibrium model, recently developed. This model gives results {{similar to those of}} kinetic calculations for N 2 and H 2 plasmas but with calculation times two orders magnitude faster. Pseudo-equilibrium calculation takes into account the reactions <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> instead of ionization reactions, while keeping all the species present in the kinetic calculation. First, the theories are compared in a case already studied in the literature by Cliteur: a heavy species temperature Th at 6000 K, with the electron temperature Te varying between 6000 and 15 000 K. Comparison of the results shows that the multi-temperature calculations, except those of Cliteur, are far from kinetic especially for ne and nF-. In addition, the pseudo-equilibrium model fits rather well with the kinetic calculations as long as molecular species are present in the plasma. Second, to calculate the composition of non-equilibrium thermal plasmas the ratio Te/Th is assumed to vary as the logarithm of the electron densities ratio ne/ncmax, nemax being the electron density over which equilibrium prevails, i. e. 1023 m- 3. For kinetic reactions where electrons are involved (in the direct reaction while heavy species intervene in the reverse reaction), a temperature T* between Te and Th is defined. T* is calculated {{as a function of the}} electron flux to that of heavy species. The variation of T* with Th is smoother than that of Te. In such conditions again, there is an excellent agreement between kinetic and pseudo-equilibrium calculations performed at T*, which is not the case for multi-temperature calculations. These results demonstrate that the pseudo-equilibrium calculation developed for thermal plasma simple forming gases such as N 2 and H 2 can also be applied to more complex gases such as SF 6...|$|E
40|$|Semiconducting diamond is a {{candidate}} wide-band gap material for applications in vacuum microelectronic devices. Its potential use in components that are operated at high frequencies, handle high powers or are subjected to extremes of temperature and radiation {{have yet to be}} commercially realised. The work presented below sets out to determine whether semiconducting diamond is a suitable material for such active electronic devices by examining the most efficient means of initiating electron emission from Chemical Vapour Deposited (CVD), semiconducting diamond. Novel methods are reported for the incorporation of impurity atoms of Nitrogen and Phosphorus into CVD diamond that employ ion-implantation techniques. Demonstration of the efficient incorporation of these impurities to form donor states <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> into polycrystalline diamond would facilitate efficient room temperature operation of pn junctions devices. The effectiveness of boron as a p-type dopant in CVD diamond films has enabled the investigation of potential field emitter structures using different boron concentrations in order to identify their respective conduction mechanisms and to make a comparison of their relative electron emission performance. It has been concluded that efficient electron emission is observed to originate from the interface of n"+-p, silicon/diamond heterojunctions that employ thin p-type regions which are less than 5 #mu#m thick. The emission current may be controlled by the application of a low voltage forward bias of less than 1 volt. Only the np junction containing 400 ppm of boron in the p-diamond layer demonstrated forward biased electron emission. It is proposed that carrier conduction across the junction interface involves recombination and tunnelling steps between interface trap states. Furthermore it is believed that due to the junction interface being in direct contact with vacuum, within this region of the emitter structure, a surface conduction emission mechanism may operate that facilitates the field emission of electrons from the p-diamond side of the interface into free space. A number of aspects relating to the junction structure could be considered to improve its performance as a cold cathode emitter: a p-diamond layer exhibiting a higher carrier mobility; a controlled number, distribution and type of defect residing at the interface; an emission surface conditioned to exhibit a stable Negative Electron Affinity (NEA). To more clearly define the operation of a diamond cold cathode emitter based upon this junction structure further exploratory effort would be required to be undertaken in the future.

40|$|The defect {{structure}} of RE doped Fluorides {{has been studied}} along with the conductivity properties, {{using a variety of}} techniques, both experimental and theoretical. Two systems have been studied in detail, which represent two kinds of defect states for RE doped SrFr. The system SrFr:CeF, has been treated in terms of a random distribution of the Ce 3 * ions. Our model of this system includes the following assumptions: i The Ce 3 * ions are distributed more or less statistically over the Sr 2 * sub-lattice. ii The mobility of the interstitial F- ions is relatively large at NN and NNN sites and low at the remaining sites. iii If two Ce 3 * ions share NN or NNN sites the interstitial F- ions are able to move from one Ce 3 * ion to the other by crossing low barriers only. The two Ce 3 * ions now form a cluster of size two. Upon doping with Ce, statistical clusters of Ce 3 * ions are formed in accordance with the above definition. Interstitial F- ions have a high mobility within the clusters. With increasing Ce concentration larger statistical clusters of Ce 3 * ions will appear. At some concentration, the percolation threshold, a percolation cluster is formed and the conductivity is strongly enhanced. The behaviour of the DC conductivity {{as a function of the}} Ce concentration, observed by the AC impedance technique and TDR (chapters 3 and 4), is in line with this view. The conductivity increases strongly with the Ce concentration. Near the percolation threshold the rate of increase is much larger. We have compared the experimental results of the DC conductivity with the theory of random walks in random barrier networks, which describes conductivity in a network of high and low barriers. This theory provides a good qualitative description of the conductivity properties of Ce doped SrFr. However, it appears that the assumption that the low potential barriers for interstitial F- motion is limited to NN and NNN sites is too crude. In reality, it is likely that the change from low to high potential barriers is more gradual. This may explain the deviation between the experimental results and the theory, especially in the critical region near the percolation threshold. The MD results obtained for SrF, doped with La (a system comparable to SrFr:Ce) supports the model of statistical clustering of the large RE ions in SrF, (chapter 6). The results show a similar behaviour for the conductivity and the activation energy as a function of the La concentration. From the ionic trajectories it can be seen that the F ions have a high mobility in the vicinity of the La 3 * ions and in clusters of La 3 * ions. The {{defect structure}} of the system SrFr:YbF, is determined by the process of the formation of compact clusters. The following assumptions seem to be valid: i The RE ions form compact clusters. This process is called preferential clustering. ii With increasing RE concentration more complex clusters are formed containing two or more RE ions. iii The interstitial F- ions are bound by the clusters. iv Some cluster types are able to trap extra interstitial F- ions. Chapter 9 Due to the formation of compact clusters the number of dipoles decreases rapidly. The interstitial F- ions, which are responsible for the increase of the conductivity, are bound more strongly to the clusters. Some of the clusters are able to trap extra interstitial Fions. As a result, the increase of conductivity is only moderate compared to Ce doped SrFr, and the behaviour with increasing Yb concentration is complex. Dissociation of interstitial F- ions from the clusters can be observed in the DTA spectra. Above 1000 K a (double) peak is visible, which coincides with the change to another conductivity mechanism with a higher activation energy. This (double) peak dominates the DTA spectrum at large Yb concentrations. Local distortions of the F- sub-lattice, due to the compact clusters, give rise to the R,,, relaxation, The R,,, relaxation is associated with a small activation energy of approximately 0. 04 eV. Above 2 molYo Yb concentration the R,,, relaxation contributes strongly to the dielectric constant, which indicates that above this Yb concentration large numbers of clusters are formed with local distortion of the Fsub- lattice. By MD simulation, we have observed that the À,,, relaxation appears in the 212, cluster. However, there may exist other cluster types, in which a similar relaxation process, associated with a low activation energy, occurs. The results for pure SrF, yield a new view on the conductivity mechanism at high temperatures. At moderate temperatures only very few Frenkel defects are present in pure SrF., and the conductivity is (mainly) determined by the mobility of the vacancies at the F- sub-lattice. The appearance of a cluster-polarization-like contribution to the dielectric constant in the TDR spectra, which increases with temperature, indicates that the mechanism for ionic conductivity becomes much more complicated at high temperatures. A complex defect structure was found consisting of highly mobile vacancies and relatively slowly moving interstitial F- ions. The mobility of the vacancies is enhanced within clusters due to the presence of interstitial F- ions. This is quite similar to our model of the conductivity mechanism of SrF, doped with randomly distributed Ce 3 * ions. In pure SrF, the defect structure is dynamic, due to the creation and annihilation of the Frenkel pairs. This type of behaviour was confirmed by the MD simulations of pure SrFr. For the RE doped crystals the dynamic defect structure caused by Frenkel pair creation and annihilation, also exists at high temperatures, but it is mixed with the "static" defect structure of the RE dopant ions and the accompanying interstitial F- ions. The MD simulations of chapter 6 show that this technique is very well suited to study defect structures and conductivity mechanisms. However, one has to make the restriction that the number of thermally activated defects is not in a critical state. This restriction is related to the small size of the simulated systems. In the case of the simulation of pure SrF, the number of Frenkel defects is strongly dependent on the temperature and problems arise if very few Frenkel defects are present. For the RE doped systems this problem doesn't arise because the interstitial F- ions, which are responsible for the enhancement of the conductivity, arc present due to the doping of the crystals. Thc Raman spectra show a strong dependence on the defect structure (chapter 7). A number of peaks appear due to the presence of the RE impurities and interstitial F ions. By considering the symmetry properties of these peaks in combination with MD simulations (chapter 8) we were able to identify several high symmetry local modes. The peaks, with cubic A,r, E, and Tr, symmetry, are associated with vibrational modes. of cubes of lattice F- ions, which contain an interstitial F- ion. Compact clusters give rise to local distortions of the F- sub-lattice, which affect the cubes containing interstitials, and the local modes vanish. The behaviour of these modes for different type of RE dopant ions is in line with our view of the defect structure of RE doped SrFr. For RE concentration larger than 2 mol%o, the intensity of the local modes is much smaller for Yb doped samples compared to samples containing equal amounts of Ce. This indicates that complex clusters are formed in Yb doped SrFr, which cause local distortions of the F- sub-lattice. This result is in line with the observation of the R,,, relaxation for samples which contain more than 2 molYo Yb. For the Ce doped samples the behaviour of the intensity of the local modes can be understood by assuming a random distribution of the a 1 + ' Le- lons. Our investigations also open the possibility of further research. In this thesis we have shown that the RE doped Fluorides can be simulated quite well. Therefore it seems worth while to invest large amounts of computing time into the simulation of extended systems and to use longer simulation time. In this way the defect structures can be simulated more accurately. Also, a higher accuracy of the frequency dependent (AC) conductivity can be achieved, and the observed powerlaw behaviour, believed to be related to many particle interactions, can be studied. For pure SrFr, the use of a larger system would reduce the problem of "quantization" of the number of Frenkel defects. Experimentally, there are also several possibilities. Recent developments in pulse generator technology may expand the TDR frequency range to higher frequencies. An overlap between the TDR and MD frequency domains can be achieved. The R,,, relaxation itself can be observed by TDR if low temperatures are employed. This may yield information whether or not one distinct relaxation process is responsible for the R,,, relaxation or if a collection of relaxations <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> are present, as suggested by the AC impedance results.

When a sample having high <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> was annealed at 473 K, the fatigue strength was decreased by irreversible hydrogen although the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> barely changed. This is because the precipitation of fine carbides due to annealing causes higher sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement. High sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement was concluded to induce the fatigue strength degradation by irreversible hydrogen. Therefore, the degradation of fatigue strength by irreversible hydrogen depends on the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> and sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement...|$|R

40|$|This numerica l {{study of}} the {{stability}} of laminar flames specifically addresses the dependence of stability on finite-rate chemistry <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> and variable thermodynamic and transport properties. The calculations show that <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> and details of chemistry play a minor role in altering the linear neutral stability results from asymptotic analysis. Variable specific heat makes a marginal change to the stability; variable transport properties, on the other hand, tend to substantially enhance the stability from a critica l wave number of about 0. 50 to 0. 20. Also, the effects of variable properties tend to nullify the effects of nonunity Lewis number. When the Lewis number of a single species is different from unity, as is true in a hydrogen-air premixed flame, the stability results remain close to that of unity Lewis number.

The structure determination shows a 3 D pillared-layer framework, where perylene cores are arranged in an unusual end-to-end off-slipped and zigzag arrangement directed by K-I-carboxylate bonding. Photophysical studies revealed a broad absorption band with lambda(max) of 531 nm and bathochromically shifted red emission centered at 655 nm. This characteristic emission has been assigned due to J-coupling of the PTC linkers in the solid state. The framework contains 1 D water-filled channel, and the desolvated framework shows permanent porosity, ``as realized by type-I CO 2 adsorption profile at 195 K. Interestingly, the guest and coordinated water molecules in the framework are connected via H-bonding and based on these characteristics, the framework was further exploited for proton conduction.

40|$|Dynamic supramolecular systems {{involving}} a tetratopic palladium(II) acceptor and three different pyridine-and imidazole-based donors {{have been used}} for self-selection by a synergistic effect of morphological information and coordination ability of ligands through specific coordination interactions. Three different cages were first synthesized by two-component self-assembly of individual donor and acceptor. When all four components were allowed to interact in a reaction mixture, only one out of three cages was isolated. The preferential binding affinity towards a particular partner was also established by transforming a non-preferred cage into a preferred cage by interaction with the appropriate ligand. Computational studies further supported the fact that coordination interaction of imidazole moiety to Pd-II is enthalpically more preferred compared to pyridine, which drives the selection process. Analysis of crystal packing of both complexes indicated the presence of strong hydrogen bonds between nitrate and water molecules and also H-bonded 3 D networks of water. Both complexes exhibit promising proton conductivity (10 (- 5) to ca. 10 (- 3) Scm(- 1)) at ambient temperature under a relative humidity of circa 98 % <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rat thymocytes {{displayed}} robust regulatory volume decrease (RVD) when {{suspended in}} NaCl-based hypotonic Ringer solutions. The RVD of thymo-cytes was completely abolished upon replacement of external Na+ ions with K+, indicating a role of coupled eux of K+ and Cl − ions as {{a driving force}} of regu-latory volume decrease. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) measured in KCl-based hypotonic solutions was (1 : 3 1 : 0 10 − 4 cm/s at 25 C and was temperature-dependent <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> (Ea = 4 : 65 0 : 77 kcal/mol) characteristic to water transport through pores. HgCl 2 and a sulfhydryl-blocking reagent, methyl methanethiosulphonate (MMTS), modulated the water permeability of thymocytes in a biphasic manner: inhibited at low dose (0. 1 { 1 mol/l) and restored or even enhanced at higher (10 { 100 mol/l) concentrations. RVD paralleled the Pf: it was greatly suppressed at low dose of MMTS (sucient to attenuate the water trans-port), but recovered at higher dose, when the water movement was restored. There-fore we suggest that thymocytes require the eective water transport for functional regulatory volume decrease. Key words: Thymocytes | Cell volume regulation | Water permeabilit...|$|R

This provides revealing three deep-level bands located at EV + 0. 31 eV, EC – 0. 35 eV and EC – 0. 43 eV using the stripe-shaped p-i-n diodes fabricated on the basis of these layers. The most interesting observation is the local state recharging process which proceeds <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> (∼ 50 meV) or without activation. The recharging may occur by carrier tunneling within deep-level bands owing to the high dislocation density ∼ 1011 - 1012 cm- 2.
