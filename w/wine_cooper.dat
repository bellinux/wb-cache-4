50|$|The winery {{was founded}} in 1978 by Dr. Robert Gross and his wife Corrine and {{released}} its first vintage in 1987. The vineyards obtained state organic certification in 1995, and biodynamic certification in 1999. In 2004, the winery released a third tier of <b>wine</b> called <b>Cooper</b> Hill to add to its two existing tiers: Cooper Mountain Reserves and 5 Elements Series. The winery released its first balsamic vinegar in 2006. Current production at the winery is 18,000 cases.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ground floor}} section is {{dedicated}} to wine-growing tools and to vineyard work. The stained-glass windows that are exhibited here reproduce those of Chartres Cathedral, which represent, among other occupations, those of <b>wine</b> traders, <b>coopers</b> and wine-growers. A 17th-century wood and plaster statue called [...] "Our Lady of the Bunch" [...] can be seen. The first bunch of grapes was set in its hand for luck. Initially placed in a street of the town, it was sold to a Parisian second-hand goods dealer. Flora Gallica bought it thanks to a contribution.|$|R
50|$|One {{reference}} {{not fully}} explored {{is that of}} the name Whincoop/Wincoop, which seems to be of Dutch, German or Scandinavian origin. The Germanic name Wijnkooper means a <b>wine</b> <b>cooper.</b> The earliest references to Whincup and variants appear in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Suffolk and no other counties at all, that is in the east coastal region. Could this be a pointer to the origin? However, there are no foreign-sounding Christian names amongst the very early Whincup references which, as we know, often pass down several generations, suggesting either there is no Dutch connection, they anglicised very quickly or the connection is much further back.|$|E
50|$|Born in {{the parish}} of St. Nicholas, Bristol, on 29 August 1675, he was the eldest son of John Lewis, <b>wine</b> <b>cooper</b> in the city. Francis Lewis, vicar of Worth Matravers, Dorset, was his {{paternal}} grandfather. His mother was Mary, eldest daughter of John Eyre, merchant, of Poole. He received his education first under Samuel Conant, rector of Lichet-Matravers, next at Wimborne grammar school, under John Moyle and afterwards under John Russel in the grammar school at Poole. He acted as assistant to Russel, who, after he had moved to Wapping, obtained for Lewis admission to the free school of Ratcliff Cross, belonging to the Coopers' Company.|$|E
50|$|Collins {{was born}} in Centerville, Delaware, on February 16, 1746. He was the {{descendant}} of English immigrants that died early in their lives. His father was Charles Collins, a <b>wine</b> <b>cooper</b> from Bristol, England, who was an orphan and had immigrated to America in 1734 {{at the age of}} nineteen. When Collins's father immigrated to American he debarked at New Castle, Delaware, an area with a large population of Quakers. Collins' father became a farmer in that area (Brandywine Hundred) near the Pennsylvania border and married Sarah Hammond, an English immigrant from Chester County, Pennsylvania. Collins had a sister (Elizabeth) who never married and was his only sibling. They were close throughout their lives.|$|E

40|$|In 1995 Texas Historical Commission (THC) {{staff and}} a team of {{researchers}} discovered a shipwreck in the mud of Matagorda Bay. Preliminary artifact recovery included a decorated bronze cannon that identified the wreck as la Belle, the fourth and final vessel of the ill-fated venture to found a colony on the Texas coast by French explorer Robert Cavalier Sieur de La Salle. A full excavation of the site was conducted in the following years. Among the items recovered was an intact chest (Artifact No. 11500) which at the time became known as the Belle Mystery Chest. Initial inspection revealed that the chest was most likely a repository for various tools, but further work revealed a sundry collection of artifacts. Subsequent artifact analysis determined the tools to be instruments used in a variety of occupations ranging from that of French <b>wine</b> <b>coopering</b> to those of agricultural, military, and maritime endeavors. Historical research primarily using the firsthand reports from the expedition??s survivors suggest the chest was first boarded in France on one of La Salle??s other ship??s, l??Aimable, unloaded prior to that vessel??s wrecking at the mouth of Matagorda Bay, taken to the new settlement by way of la Belle, and eventually returned to the ship just prior to its sinking. Records verify that La Salle often claimed the possessions of the dead and that he ordered the ship reloaded with his personal goods and other supplies before it sank. Along with two artifacts with differing ownership initials and the sheer diversity of the chest??s contents, these clues suggest that the chest may have been a repository for various utilitarian items collected by La Salle before the loss of la Belle in January of 1686...|$|R
40|$|It was {{not until}} after the mid-eighteenth century that the masonic lodges in Edinburgh became common meeting ground for the social and {{intellectual}} elite. While there are examples {{of these types of}} men joining before 1750, it was after this watershed date that some of the key men associated with enlightenment thinking in Scotland became members of Edinburgh lodges. Robert Adam, Hugh Blair, Lord Monboddo, James Gregory, Henry Mackenzie and Dugald Stewart are only a few examples of men who made a dual contribution to both freemasonry and the enlightenment. 'Freemasonry in Edinburgh, 1721 - 1746 : institutions and context' is an examination of freemasonry in Edinburgh before the dramatic influx of the elite. It was during this period that three major developments occurred: existing lodges began the slow transition from traditional operative lodges to the more modern, accepted lodges; lodges were being founded with little or no connection to stonemasons or stoneworks; and, the Grand Lodge of Scotland was established, creating a definite masonic community both within and outwith Edinburgh. This thesis charts the progress of the transition in nine Edinburgh lodges by examining both the histories and membership of these lodges, and considers the influence of the Grand Lodge of Scotland on this process. The key element in this transitional process was the membership. A total of 785 men are known to have joined, or belonged to, these lodges during this period. These men represented occupations from the advocate to the humble <b>wine</b> <b>cooper's</b> servant, and social circumstances from the baronet to the indweller. This membership analysis was the most important area of research because it illustrated the transition in the lodges. Using 30 November 1736, the date that the Grand Lodge Roll began, as a watershed date, it is possible to establish the membership of the lodges during the entire period of study, and to compare the membership of pre-Grand Lodge lodges {{both before and after the}} establishment of the Grand Lodge of Scotland...|$|R
5000|$|Dettlieb Christopher Jessen {{was born}} in Holstein and came to Halifax {{as one of the}} Foreign Protestants in 1751, {{settling}} in Lunenburg two years later. He was a <b>wine</b> <b>cooper.</b> Jessen served as lieutenant in the local militia, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. He served in response to the Raid on Lunenburg (1756) and the Lunenburg Campaign (1758) during the French and Indian War and in the Raid on Lunenburg (1782) during the American Revolution. [...] He was also a justice of the peace, a judge in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas, registrar of deeds and a customs collector. Jessen married Francisca Barbara Rudolf in 1755.

5000|$|The {{collection}} is arranged in thematic areas. [...] "In each room {{a number of}} fine and often rare objects illustrate a particular subject area, suggesting connections with other themes that enrich the overall picture".The first room explains the Middle-East roots of viticulture and how it reached the Mediterranean basin, through several pieces of archaeology from the Bronze Age to the late-ancient era, with particular attention to Etruscan culture. Among the items on display, there is the lip cup attributed to Phrynos Painter, one of the Little masters.Rooms 2 to 8 show viticulture techniques used in Umbria. Many working tools well illustrate the yearly wine cycle and traditional techniques. A varied section also illustrates places and ways of wine consumption. The basement {{is home to a}} large room dedicated to winemaking, with large presses, distillers, a bottling machine and other objects. Room 6 shows how Vin Santo is made.The itinerary follows illustrating crafts related to <b>wine</b> (<b>coopers,</b> smiths etc.) and a large collection of tools. Room 8 describes regulation about harvesting-time, usage and trade of wine, to pass to local handicraft and viniculture in rooms 9 and 10.Rooms 11 to 15 are dedicated to pottery, with a rich collection of ceramics coming from the most prestigious pottery-producing regions of Italy. The collection of pottery is arranged according to the following thematic division: “wine as food” (measures, bottles, etc.), “wine as a medicine” (jars, mortars, pharmaceutical containers, books, etc.) and finally “wine and mythology” (symbolic and story-telling decorations mainly related to Dionysos/Bacchus, including works by Mastro Giorgio Andreoli and Girolamo della Robbia). Room 16 boasts the largest existing collection of irons for wafer, in Umbria usually served with Vin Santo.Room 17 hosts a rich collection of engravings and sketches, made of about 600 pieces concerning dionysian scenes with pictures by authors like Mantegna, Piranesi, Picasso.Room 18 is dedicated to ex libris.The visit ends in room 19 where fiction and non-fiction ancient books about wine are exposed.|$|R

60|$|It {{seemed to}} both of them to be a most {{singular}} abode for such a man as Trevelyan. At {{the top of the hill}} there was a huge entrance through a wooden gateway, which seemed to have been constructed with the intention of defying any intruders not provided with warlike ammunition. The gates were, indeed, open at the period of their visit, but it must be supposed that they were intended to be closed at any rate at night. Immediately on the right, as they entered through the gates, there was a large barn, in which two men were <b>coopering</b> <b>wine</b> vats. From thence a path led slanting to the house, of which the door was shut, and all the front windows blocked with shutters. The house was very long, and only of one story for a portion of its length. Over that end at which the door was placed there were upper rooms, and there must have been space enough for a large family with many domestics. There was nothing round or near the residence which could be called a garden, so that its look of desolation was extreme. There were various large barns and outhouses, as though it had been intended by the builder that corn and hay and cattle should be kept there; but it seemed now that there was nothing there except the empty vats at which the two men were coopering. Had the Englishmen gone farther into the granary, they would have seen that there were wine-presses stored away in the dark corners.|$|R
