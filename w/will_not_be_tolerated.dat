Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated</b> and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E

500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

50|$|Inter-annual {{variation}} between {{wet and dry}} {{periods in}} which abundant rainfall {{is followed by a}} drought period have been a commonality in Saskatchewan wetlands since their formation nearly 14,000 years ago. However, unprecedented changes in climate expected in the prairies have many experts concerned that Saskatchewan wetland ecosystems <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able <b>tolerate</b> the heat, and intensified wet/dry cycles., For example, Sorenson et al. (1998) predicted that with a doubling of carbon dioxide, the prairie pothole duck population would be cut in half by the year 2060 due to a loss of wetland habitat. It remains unknown how wetland organisms will respond to oncoming climate change; yet, perhaps the biggest uncertainty is predicting the way Saskatchewan citizens decide to share their water with vulnerable wetland ecosystems. As the climate changes in the province of Saskatchewan, improved attention to water management may be critical to protecting Saskatchewan’s fragile wetlands.|$|R

40|$|Surveillance of {{infection}}s at the Ottawa General Hospital between September 1, 1971 and August 31, 1972 {{showed that}} the overall infection rate was 13. 5 % of which 5. 6 % was community-acquired while 7. 9 % was of nosocomial origin. These figures are comparable to those for equivalent hospitals in the United States and lower than those reported from the Boston City Hospital, but they nevertheless indicate that over half the infected patients in the hospital were infected after admission. Urinary tract infections accounted for 44. 8 % of all nosocomial infections and clearly dominated the picture. The postoperative wound infection rate was 3. 9 % and accounted for only 18 % of nosocomial infections. It is probable that these findings are representative of general hospitals throughout Canada and indicate conditions which <b>will</b> <b>not</b> long <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> The knowledge and techniques exist {{for the prevention of}} all hospital cross-infection and much autogenous infection. Specific measures are suggested for working towards this goal. These are (1) the replacement of archaic hospitals and hospital facilities, (2) the establishment in every hospital of an efficient surveillance program, (3) the institution of good catheterization and catheter care techniques, and (4) the establishment by hospitals of a quality control program whereby a specific explanation is required for every infection occurring within the hospital...|$|R
40|$|Abstract–Many video {{applications}} are scalable due to human tolerance to degradation in picture quality, frame loss and end-to-end delay. Scalability allows the network to utilize its resources efficiently for supporting additional connections, thereby increasing revenue {{and number of}} supported customers. This {{can be accomplished by}} a dynamic admission control scheme which scales down existing connections to support new requests. However, users <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to <b>tolerate</b> quality degradation unless it is coupled with monetary or availability incentives. In this paper we propose a pricing policy and a corresponding admission control scheme for scalable VOD applications. The pricing policy is two-tiered, based on a connection setup component and a scalable component. Connections which are more scalable are charged less but are more liable to be degraded. The proposed policy trades off performance degradation with monetary incentives to improve user benefit and network revenue, and to decrease the blocking probability of connection requests. We demonstrate by means of simulation that this policy encourages users to specify the scalability of an application to the network...|$|R
