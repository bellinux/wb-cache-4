500|$|In May 1999, {{a list of}} 116 alleged MI6 agents {{was sent}} to the LaRouche movement's {{publication}} Executive Intelligence Review, a weekly magazine which published it online. Its names included Andrew Fulton, who had recently retired, as well as David Spedding and Richard Dearlove. MI6 biographer Stephen Dorril explained that most of the names were [...] "light-cover" [...] sources who worked out of embassies or missions posing as diplomats. Dorril argued, [...] "it is well known that rival intelligence networks know <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are and accept them." [...] MI6 claimed that Tomlinson had originated the list, which was something he had previously threatened to do, although he denied responsibility for it, and MI6 were unable to substantiate their accusation.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{claimed that}} [...] "Monolith forges new shooter {{territory}} with some truly freaky elements, challenge, fun, and beauty." [...] GameSpy praised the game's plot, later awarding it their [...] "Best Story" [...] Game of the Year award. The New York Times thought differently, stating [...] "I was never quite clear {{on what was}} going on in the game. I knew my goal—track down a psychic, escort a corporate executive's daughter out of danger—but I didn't ever care <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were nor did I understand their motives." [...] The game has also received criticism for its system requirements, which called for an extremely powerful PC for its time. The Xbox 360 port has also received positive reviews, almost as favorable as the PC version. The multiplayer and instant-action mode were praised for better gameplay, but the control scheme was negatively viewed. Reviews have also stated that it lacked bonus features, despite the new mission included in the game. GameSpot gave the game 8.6. while IGN rated it 9.1 ...|$|E
500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by many critics, though some {{were not as}} happy with it. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade, and wrote that what he [...] "liked most of all" [...] was it being [...] "remarkably clear-eyed about <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are and what they're capable of". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post described it as [...] "heartfelt, comical and, yes, absolutely ridiculous", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called it a [...] "tearful and touching finale". Though she acknowledged exceptions, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone characterized the episode as a [...] "nonstop sapfest of too many tears and not enough nostalgia", while Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker said it had [...] "the perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations" [...] and described it as [...] "a season finale that sure felt like a series finale". Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that [...] "there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have [...] "felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe". Hankinson also said it left him with [...] "mostly questions" [...] but also [...] "some fury". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a [...] "perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the [...] "class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, {{you would have thought}} you were watching one of the show's first 13 episodes".|$|E

2500|$|In September 1499, Vasco da Gama {{returned}} to Lisbon, Portugal, from his voyage to India. Before da Gama's return, Girolamo Sernigi wrote about Portuguese accounts that [...] "certain vessels of white Christians" [...] had made port at Calicut on the Malabar coast generations before their arrival. The Portuguese speculated that these unknown mariners {{could have been}} the Germans or the Russians, but Sernigi concluded that [...] "on the arrival of the captain [...] we may learn <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are." [...] After his arrival at Calicut, Vasco da Gama began hearing tales of pale bearded men who sailed with their giant ships along the local coastal waters of Calicut generations before. At the time, the Portuguese had not yet discovered that these stories were actually about Zheng He's fleets. They would eventually discover that these unknown mariners were, in fact, the Chinese. Da Gama's men were apparently even mistaken for the Chinese at first on arrival at the East African coast, because the Chinese had been the last-seen pale-skinned strangers arriving with large wooden ships in the memories of the East African people.|$|E

Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are, that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film. Cranston, despite his positive opinion on the film, would later opine that killing off Joe Brody so early was a [...] "narrative mistake".|$|E

60|$|The butler bowed low at this address, {{and caused}} the five magicians to be {{conducted}} to five magnificent chambers, where were slaves, and lights, and baths, and soap, and towels, and wash-rags, and tooth-brushes; and each magician took a gorgeous dress from his pack, and put it on, {{and then they were}} all conducted (with Ting-a-ling still in Zamcar's turban) to the grand hall, where the feast was being held. Here they found the dwarf and his guests, numbering a hundred, having a truly jolly time. The dwarf, who was dressed in white (to make him look larger), was seated on a high red velvet cushion {{at the end of the}} hall, and the company sat cross-legged on rugs, in a great circle before him. He was drinking out of a huge bottle nearly as big as himself, and eating little birds; and judging by the bones that were left, he must have eaten nearly a whole flock of them. When he saw the five magicians entering, he stopped eating, and opened his eyes in amazement, and then shouted to his servants to tell him <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were, who came without permission to his feast; but as no one knew, nobody answered.

60|$|This {{conversation}} {{took place}} between the two cousins when Walter had been already {{two or three weeks}} at Dunripple. He had come there intending to stay over two or three days, and he had already accepted an invitation to make the house his home as long as he should remain in England. He had known but little of his uncle and nothing of his cousin, before this visit was made. He had conceived them to be unfriendly to him, having known them to be always unfriendly to his father. He was, of course, aware,--very well aware now, since he had himself suffered so grievously from his father's dishonesty,--that the enmity which had reached them from Dunripple had been well deserved. Colonel Marrable had, as a younger brother, never been content with what he was able to extract from the head of the family, who was, in his eyes, a milch cow that never ought to run dry. With Walter Marrable there had remained a feeling adverse to his uncle and cousin, even after he had been forced to admit to himself how many and how grievous were the sins of his own father. He had believed that the Dunripple people were stupid, and prejudiced, and selfish; and it had only been at the instance of his uncle, the parson, that he had consented to make the visit. He had gone there, and had been treated, at any rate, with affectionate consideration. And he had found the house to be not unpleasant, though very quiet. Living at Dunripple there was a Mrs. Brownlow, a widowed sister of the late Lady Marrable, with her daughter, Edith Brownlow. Previous to this time Walter Marrable had never even heard of the Brownlows, so little had he known about Dunripple; and when he arrived there it had been necessary to explain to him <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were.|$|E
