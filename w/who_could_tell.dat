25|$|Two months later, the Tar Heel {{noted that}} the Hedgepeth case {{remained}} open, along {{with the death of}} David Shannon, a UNCCH freshman whose body had been found on the grounds of a Carrboro cement plant the previous October 27 (while he had died from a fall, the autopsy found he was severely intoxicated, and the Carrboro police suspected hazing and believed there might be other students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them more about the circumstances of Shannon's death). In Hedgepeth's case, there had been no new information about a possible suspect since January. Yet the case records remained under court-ordered seal.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{described}} Venturi as the [...] "chief negotiator, {{who remains}} {{in the dark and}} is almost unknown". Noting Pius XI and Mussolini's penchant for privacy regarding the negotiations, the Times continued to describe Venturi as [...] "a quiet man <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> much" [...] yet refused to acknowledge that he was any more than [...] "Mussolini's personal messenger to the Vatican". Nominally, Francesco Pacelli (the brother of Eugenio Pacelli, future Pope Pius XII) became the chief negotiator and Venturi his intermediary with Mussolini during the final stages of the negotiation (after the death of State Councilor Domenico Barone). The other negotiators were Francesco Borgongini Duca, the Vatican's Secretary of Extraordinary Affairs, and Professor Gianinni Barone, the brother of Domenico; however, Venturi himself was the originator of the negotiations.New York Times. 1929, January 15.

2500|$|One day, {{while playing}} with his grandson, Kamin is summoned by his adult {{children}} to watch the launch of a rocket, which everyone seems to know about except him. As he walks outside into the glaring sunlight, Kamin sees Eline and Batai, as young as {{when he first saw}} them. They explain that he has already seen the rocket, just before he came there. Knowing that the planet was doomed, the planet's leaders placed the memories of their culture into a probe and launched it into space, in the hope that it would find someone <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> others about their species. Picard then realizes the entire context: [...] "Oh, it's me, isn't it?", he says, [...] "I'm the someone...I'm the one it finds." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 12–13, 1927, {{following}} {{testimony by}} the defense firearms expert Albert H. Hamilton before the Committee, the Assistant District Attorney for Massachusetts, Dudley P. Ranney, {{took the opportunity to}} cross-examine Hamilton. He submitted affidavits questioning Hamilton's credentials as well as his performance during the New York trial of Charles Stielow, in which Hamilton's testimony linking rifling marks to a bullet used to kill the victim nearly sent an innocent man to the electric chair. [...] The Committee also heard from Braintree's police chief who told them he had found the cap on Pearl Street, allegedly dropped by Sacco during the crime, a full 24-hours after the getaway car had fled the scene. [...] The chief doubted the cap belonged to Sacco and called the whole trial a contest [...] "to see <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the biggest lies." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
60|$|The boys looked surprised, some {{exchanged}} {{nods and}} winks, others turned away to conceal a laugh; but the teacher engaged {{in conversation with}} them, and soon put them all at their ease, except poor Joseph, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> how this strange interview was likely to end.|$|R

60|$|Mr Haredale entered, {{followed}} by the locksmith. Turning {{with a look of}} great astonishment to the old woman who had opened the door, he inquired for Mrs Rudge--for Barnaby.

6000|$|My {{companion}} and I, having {{a discussion on}} some point of ancient history, were amused by the attitude which the Indian, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> {{what we were talking}} about, assumed.

60|$|Mappin was undermost. He {{struck the}} steps half-way down, {{but it did}} not stop them. They rolled into the store amid a {{confused}} outcry.

5000|$|Elie Wiesel {{argued that}} Moses {{ran away from}} Egypt in [...] because he was {{disappointed}} with his fellow Jews.
