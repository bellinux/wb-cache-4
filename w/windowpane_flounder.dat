50|$|<b>Windowpane</b> <b>flounder</b> (Scophthalmus aquosus) is a {{fish species}} in the family Scophthalmidae. Widespread on the depth of 5-73 meters in the Western Atlantic from the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to Florida in the United States. An {{important}} commercial species, they can grow up to 45.7 cm in length, and live up to 7 years.|$|E
5000|$|Neomysis {{americana}} is an [...] "extremely common" [...] {{species of}} opossum shrimp along the Atlantic coast of North and South America. The species has a disjunct distribution, being present {{in an area}} extending from the Saint Lawrence River to Florida, and separately in parts of Argentina (Blanca Bay, Anegada Bay and Samborombón Bay). There may be a further division within the North American populations between those north of Cape Henry, Virginia (including Georges Bank) and those from North Carolina southwards. N. americana is an important prey item {{for a number of}} fish species, including the Atlantic silverside, the bluefish and the <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder,</b> Scophthalmus aquosus. Adults typically have a carapace length of 2.5 - 4 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} marine {{fish in the}} Sound include porgy, butterfish, winter flounder, summer flounder, <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder,</b> fourspot flounder, {{northern}} and striped sea robin, little skate, menhaden, Atlantic silversides, black seabass, blackfish (tautog), cunner, bluefish, and smooth dogfish. Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} {{flatfish}} in the Southern New England (SNE) area have been assessed as overfished {{and in need}} of rebuilding. These species have some common characteristics in terms of life history patterns, use of habitat, and distribution. Many are targeted species in directed fisheries; others are bycatch/discard species, especially in the small mesh fishery in SNE for squid, (Loligo pealeii), butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) and scup (Stenotomus chrysops); these species include summer (Paralichthys dentatus), winter (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), yellowtail (Limanda ferruginea) and <b>windowpane</b> (Scophthalmus aquosus) <b>flounders.</b> As a result, {{there is a need to}} find gear solutions to prevent capture. A modified fishing net (MFN) was designed using a standard bottom trawl squid net with the addition of 30. 5 cm (12 inch) extensions to the headrope and a 30. 5 cm (12 inch) drop chain between the sweep and the footrope. It was tested on its ability to reduce the capture of flatfish by creating a space between the sweep and the footrope. Initial testing to make adjustments to the sweep design of the modified fishing net was conducted at the flume tank facility at the Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Resources located at the Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. ^ A catch characterization study was conducted aboard two commercial fishing vessels targeting squid using the 2 ̆ 2 side-by-side 2 ̆ 2 towing method comparing the standard fishing net (SFN) with the MFN. The nets were switched every two days and used an equal number of times on each vessel. Work was done over 12 months around Block Island Sound and Rhode Island Sound and consisted of 8 fishing days. Each fishing day consisted of six 40 minute tows. For each tow all flatfish were sampled or if necessary a sub-sample was taken following Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) protocols (NEFSC 2010). Catch included target species, (i. e. squid, butterfish, scup), flounder species (fluke, sand dabs, fourspot flounder (Paralichthys oblongus), winter flounder, yellowtail flounder) and skate (Leucoraja erinacea) which were weighed. Other appropriate bycatch was also sampled and weighed. When appropriate, flatfish species were measured and sorted into sublegal and legal sizes prior to weighing. ^ After checking for vessel effects, a paired t-test was used to test for differences between the combined mean weight (catch by species) per tow (in kilograms) of the SFN and MFN. Results show a significant difference between mean weights per tow for summer, winter, yellowtail, fourspot and <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounders.</b> There was no significant difference between mean weights captured by the SFN and MFN for all three target species. ^ The findings of this research indicate the 30. 5 cm (12 in.) drop chain trawl net design has the ability to reduce the capture of flatfish while retaining target species in the small mesh fishery of Southern New England. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Windowpane</b> <b>flounder</b> (Scophthalmus aquosus) is a left-eyed, {{flatfish}} species {{which is}} primarily {{found between the}} high water mark and 50 m, but also inhabits depths of up to 200 m (Klein-MacPhee 2002). The Southern New England-Mid-Atlantic Bight (SNE-MAB) <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder</b> stock was most recently assessed in 2008 at a Groundfish Assessment Review Meeting (GARM III) using An Index-based Model (AIM) for the period 1975 - 2007 (NEFSC 2008). Input data to the AIM model consisted of: discards, landings, and the NEFSC fall survey biomass indices. The current biological reference points, adopted at the 2008 GARM and in Amendment 16 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (NEFMC 2009), are: FMSY proxy = 1. 47 kt/kg per tow and BMSY proxy = 0. 34 kg per tow. The FMSY proxy was estimated from the AIM model and represents the relative fishing mortality rate (catch in year t / average fall survey biomass index during years t through t- 2) at which the stock can replace itself. The MSY proxy (= 500 mt) is the median catch {{during a period of}} time when the stock was assumed to have been replacing itself (1995 - 2001), and was divided by the FMSY proxy to compute the BMSY proxy.

The Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank (GOM-GB) <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder</b> stock was most recently assessed in 2008 at a Groundfish Assessment Review Meeting (GARM III) using “An Index-based Model ” (AIM) for the period 1975 - 2007 (NEFSC 2008). Input data to AIM consisted of U. S. discards, U. S. landings, and relative biomass indices derived from the fall surveys conducted by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC). The current biological reference points (BRPs) were adopted at the 2008 GARM (NEFSC 2008) and promulgated via Amendment 16 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (NEFMC 2009). The current BRPs are: FMSY proxy = 0. 50 kt/kg per tow and BMSY proxy = 1. 40 kg per tow. The FMSY proxy was estimated from the AIM model and the MSY proxy was assumed as the median catch during 1995 - 2001, a period when the stock appeared {{to be able to}} replace itself based on the AIM replacement ratios. The MSY proxy was divided by the FMSY proxy to compute the BMSY proxy. Based on the results from the 2008 GARM, the stock was overfished and overfishing was occurring in 2007 (NEFSC 2008).

40|$|No stock {{structure}} {{information is}} available. Therefore, a provisional arrangement {{has been adopted}} that recognizes two stock areas based on apparent differences in growth, sexual maturity, and abundance trends between <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder</b> from Georges Bank and Southern New England. The proportion of total landings contributed by the Gulf of Maine is low, so these <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder</b> landings are combined with those from Georges Bank and the two regions are assessed as the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank (GOM-GB) stock. An age-based assessment for this stock is not possible {{because there is no}} age composition data available from either the research surveys or fishery samples. The stock has never been formally assessed as part of the SAW/SARC process. However, index-based assessments have been conducted at previous Groundfish Assessment Review Meetings (GARM). At the most recent GARM, in September 2005, the stock was assessed based on trends in relative biomass indices (stratified mean kg per tow) from the NEFSC fall surveys and relative fishing mortality rates (landings / NEFSC fall survey biomass index) during 1963 - 2004. Stock status was determined from the 2002 - 2004 averages of the NEFSC fall survey biomass indices and relative fishing mortality rates. In 2004, the stock was not overfished and overfishing was not occurring (NEFSC 2005). Several major changes have been made to the current assessment, including model type and input data. Two of the research recommendations from the 2005 GARM, discard estimation and the inclusion of inshore survey strata in the calculation of survey indices are addressed herein. An index-based model (AIM) is used to estimate an FMSY proxy, defined as the relative fishing mortality rate (catch in year t / average NEFSC fall survey relative biomass index during year t, t- 1, and t- 2) at which the stock can replace itself...|$|E
40|$|The 20 {{assessment}} updates indicate improved biomass and landings {{and generally}} lower fishing mortality rates since the mid- 1990 s (Table 5. 1; Figures 5. 1. 1 - 5. 1. 3). The biomass of {{eight of the}} stocks was at or above B-MSY in 2001, while 12 stocks were below the threshold. Stock biomasses have improved in 19 of the 20 stocks since 1995 (Figure 5. 1. 2; the exception being Mid-Atlantic yellowtail), with a median percent increase in biomass for all stocks of 177 % (range:- 33 to 2430 percent). Fishing mortality (F) rates declined for 15 of 19 stocks between 1994 and 2001 (Figure 5. 1. 3). In the case of Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, F has declined by about 90 % since the mid- 1990 s. Numerous other stocks have experienced reductions in F of 20 - 50 %, including Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine cod, Georges Bank haddock, witch flounder and American plaice. For several of the stocks where harvest rates are measured by landings to survey biomass ratios (exploitation index methods), relative Fs have been reduced by 50 % or more (e. g., Gulf of Maine haddock, pollock and <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder).</b> The four stocks showing increases in F since 1994 were Cape Cod and Mid-Atlantic yellowtail, white hake and Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder.

40|$|Diel {{spawning}} periodicity occurs {{throughout the}} spawning season in 11 of 12 fishes {{studied in the}} Peconic Bays, New York. The bay anchovy, Anchoa mitchilli; Atlantic menhaden,Brevoortia tyrannus; northern and striped searobins,Prionotus carolinus andP. evolans; hogchoker, Trinectes maculatus; weakfish, Cynoscion regalis; <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder,</b> Scophthalmus aquosus; and butterfish, Peprilus triacanthus, spawn primarily in the evening or at night. The tautog, Thutoga onitis, and cunner, Thutogolabrus adspersus, begin spawning {{in the afternoon and}} spawning continues into the night. Scup, Stenotomus chrysops, spawns in the morning, and Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus, spawns throughout the day. The prevalence of nocturnal spawners in the Peconic Bays is inconsistent with predictions of hypotheses attributing diel spawning periodicity to reproductive isolation and visual constraints. Some pOBBible causes of diel spawning periodicity are reproductive synchronism between the sexes, deleterious effects of sunlight on embryogenesis, and parent or embryo predator avoidance. In his review, Woodhead (1966) cited several refer-ences indicating that spawning occurs only in the evening or at night in some clupeids, gadids, pleuronectids, exocoetids, and mullets, and only during daylight hours in some gobies, blennies, and pomacentrids. Woodhead concluded: "There is relatively little direct information describing the spawning behaviour of marine fish, but such as is available suggests that spawning is restricted to a particular part ofthe day. " Recent research gener-ally supports that conclusion. Simpson (1971) determined the time of day of spawning of four marine fishes from the occur-rence of recently spawned eggs in plankton collec-tions. His results showed spawning occurs i...|$|E

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The {{recent history}} of {{fisheries}} management in New England has seen substantial interannual variability in total allowable catches (TACs), with stocks deemed healthy in one year retroactively identified as overfished soon thereafter. Concurrently, avenues for and examples of coordination between fishermen are increasing in the region, as exemplified by the groundfish sectors and informal bycatch avoidance programs for yellowtail and <b>windowpane</b> <b>flounder.</b> A lag exists between the updating of a stock's overfishing status and the prescribed implementation of rebuilding plans {{as required by the}} Magnuson Stevens Act. In a coordinated fishery, this lag incentivizes increased targeting of a stock likely to be binding in the following year but with relatively high TACs in the current year. Fishing is a stochastic process, with output partially determined by the probability of encountering species of interest, either due to targeting or avoidance. Thus, although next year's TAC is not conditional on this year's catch, given the right conditions the probability of encountering a limiting stock is. In this research we use trip level data to investigate the empirical evidence for this type of intertemporal arbitrage, in which fishermen increase targeting of overfished stocks in a manner efficient only when viewed in a dynamic nature...|$|E
