40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the application of}} the techniques of Fourier spectrogram and wavelet analysis to a low power embedded microprocessor application in a novel railway and rollingstock monitoring system. The safe and cost effective operation of freight railways is limited by the dynamic performance of wagons running on track. A monitoring system has been proposed comprising of low cost wireless sensing devices, dubbed "Health Cards", to be installed on every <b>wagon</b> in the <b>fleet.</b> When marshalled into a train, the devices would sense accelerations and communicate via radio network to a master system in the locomotive. The integrated system would provide online information for decision support systems. Data throughput was heavily restricted by the network architecture, so significant signal analysis was required at the device level. An electronics engineering team at Central Queensland University developed a prototype Health Card, incorporating a 27 MHz microcontroller and four dual axis accelerometers. A sensing arrangement and online analysis algorithms were required to detect and categorise dynamic events while operating within the constraints of the system. Time-frequency analysis reveals the time varying frequency content of signals, making it suitable to detect and characterise transient events. With efficient algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform, and Fast Wavelet Transform, time-frequency analysis methods can be implemented on a low power, embedded microcontroller. This thesis {{examines the}} application of time-frequency analysis techniques to wagon body acceleration signals, for the purpose of detecting poor dynamic performance of the wagon-track system. The Fourier spectrogram is implemented on the Health Card prototype and demonstrated in the laboratory. The research and algorithms provide a foundation for ongoing development as resources become available for system testing and validation...|$|R
40|$|Željeznička infrastruktura i željeznički promet tradicionalno su i povijesno od nacionalnog i strateškog interesa svake države, što objašnjava ponešto sporije liberalizacijske procese u odnosu na neke druge mrežne djelatnosti na zajedničkom tržištu Europske unije, kao što su primjerice elektroničke komunikacije. Prioritet Europske unije je ostvarenje zajedničkog europskog željezničkog područja (Single European Railway Area, SERA) kao načina dugoročnog osiguranja konkurentnosti željezničkog prometa. To je moguće pojednostavljenjem postupaka pružanja željezničkih prijevozničkih usluga, podizanjem kvalitete željezničkih i prijevozničkih usluga te uklanjanjem tržišnih neuspjeha koji mogu biti razlog neučinkovitog raspolaganja javnim sredstvima. Povećanje učinkovitosti željeznice moguće je otvaranjem tržišta za nove prijevoznike, za što je potrebno osigurati neovisnost upravitelja željezničke infrastrukture i upravitelja željezničkih uslužnih objekata. Navedeno se ostvaruje računovodstvenim razdvajanjem između upravitelja infrastrukture i željezničkih prijevoznika ako su oni vertikalno integrirani gospodarski subjekt, odnosno njihovim strukturnim razdvajanjem u zasebna trgovačka društva. EU je u posljednjih petnaestak godina donio tri pravna okvira kojima se ojačava uloga regulatornih tijela i osigurava jednak pravni položaj prijevoznika na tržištu osobito kroz neovisnost dodjele prometnih kapaciteta i određivanja naknada za njihovo korištenje. Uz navedeno, organiziraju se modeli sufinanciranja izgradnje nove i poboljšanja postojeće željezničke infrastrukture sredstvima EU fondova, podizanja interoperabilnosti i sigurnosti na razini EU-a, što bi trebalo olakšati prekogranični promet, osobito na dužim teretnim trasama, tzv. paneuropskim koridorima. Kombiniranje otvorenog pristupa nužnim željezničkim resursima i otvorenog javnog poziva za obavljanje usluga javnog prijevoza putnika omogućuje, sukladno stavovima koje zastupa Europska komisija, daljnje otvaranje tržišta kao što je već ostvareno u međunarodnom teretnom i putničkom prometu. Novi, četvrti željeznički okvir EU-a koji je u pripremi trebao bi povećati interes korisnika željezničkog prijevoza i učiniti tu prometnu granu konkurentnijom u odnosu na cestovni i zračni promet. Veći broj tržišnih takmaca trebao bi potaknuti produktivnost, specijalizaciju i inovativne poslovne modele uz veću uporabu informacijskih tehnologija. To bi trebalo doprinijeti povećanju putnika i tereta te novom zapošljavanju u željeznici i s njom povezanoj industriji. Traditionally and historically, {{each country}} has a {{national}} and strategic interest in railway infrastructure and rail transport, which explains a somewhat slower liberalization process compared to some other network services in the common EU market (such as in electronic communication). The European Union’s priority is to achieve the Single European Railway Area (SERA), which, in long term, would afford competitiveness for the rail transport. That is possible by easing the procedure of rail transport services, enhancing their quality and eliminating market failures {{which can lead to}} inefficient management of public resources. It is a political and economic challenge to raise the trends of both passenger and cargo rail transport usage in the future. Insufficient investment in railway infrastructure and rail <b>wagon</b> <b>fleets</b> in the past twenty years, especially in the EU Member States, has made rail transport less attractive and outdated, redirecting users to other transport modes, especially to road transport. These trends can be changed by modernizing railway infrastructure and increasing the uplifting transport speed. Where available, very fast passenger trains are becoming a more attractive transport mode compared to intercity air transport in Europe. Upgrading the efficiency of railways is possible by opening the market to new carriers, for which the independence of railway infrastructure managers and rail needs to be secured. That can be accomplished by separating the accounting for railway infrastructure managers and rail transport carriers if {{they are part of the}} same vertically integrated economic subject, or by separating them structurally into separate corporations. In the last fifteen years the EU has enacted three legal frameworks through which the role of regulatory bodies is strengthened and carriers are provided an equal legal position in the market, especially through the procedure of independent allocation of traffic capacities and the levying of charges for their usage. In addition, models of co-financing the development of new infrastructure and enhancing the existing one through EU funds, and enhancing the interoperability and safety of rail transport are being developed. These could facilitate cross-border transport, especially on longer cargo routes, the so-called pan-European corridors. The role of the regulator is generally to encourage competition by eliminating barriers for market functioning, especially through the regulation of railway services, and to encourage efficient usage of railway infrastructure. The regulator also promotes the interests of railway service users by securing an approach compliant with laws, transparent acts of infrastructure managers and railway service facilities managers, providing legal protection for subjects who submit the request for the allocation of infrastructural capacity, including a mechanism for resolving disputes as needed. In the latter case, the regulatory body acts upon a party’s complaint on a network report, application of that report, procedure for the allocation of capacities and other conditions of entrance, or charges for railway services. Among its other tasks, the regulator continuously observes competition in the railway services market, having the right to collect necessary information from the participants. It is empowered to protect passenger rights in the way prescribed by the EU Regulation. In that regard, it can conduct inspections and decide on passenger complaints against decisions of railway carriers. The Act on the Regulation of the Railway Services Market sets out relevant rules in regard to protection of passenger rights. Partially limited efficiency of the railway and transport service providers is usually a consequence of a lack of competition which would foster internal restructuring and reduce the needs for conventionally substantial subsidies from state funds. According to the European Commission, combining an open approach to essential railway resources and having open public invitations for offering public transport services facilitates further market development in the same manner that has already been achieved in freight and passengers transport. A new, fourth railway framework of the EU should attract more rail transport users and make this transport branch more competitive in relation to road and air transport. A larger number of market entities should foster productivity and specialization, as well as innovative business models, followed by increased usage of information technologies. This should help increase the number of transported passengers and freight, and create new jobs in the railway industry...|$|R
50|$|The {{discovery}} of diamonds on the Vaal River at Kimberley in the 1860s, and gold on the Witwatersrand ridge in the Transvaal in 1886, created {{a demand for}} passenger and goods transport, which was met during the next 30 years by some sixteen coach services including CH Zeederberg Ltd. The outbreak of the War of Independence in 1880 virtually brought carrier services to a halt. By 1882 gold was found in Northern Transvaal, and Pretoria took on a new lease of life. More gold discoveries in the Northern and Eastern Transvaal in 1884 meant that business was booming for the few companies who had established their routes. Railways had {{got off to a}} very slow start in South Africa; at the beginning of 1884 there were only 1,318 miles (2,135 km) of track in operation, of which 1213 were in the Cape Colony.This was the position in 1884, when two of the brothers, Lewis Andries (Louw) Zeederberg and Pieter Frederick (Piet) Zeederberg, who had been operating a wagon transport service south of the Vaal River, decided to extend their operations into the Transvaal. They had wide experience in this field, having carried supplies during the Zulu War, and on the cessation of hostilities, equipment and supplies from Durban and De Aar to the diamond fields. With six <b>wagons</b> in their <b>fleet</b> they decided to send for their older brother Roelof Abraham (Dolf) Zeederberg, who had given up a career as a chemist due to ill-health. Dolf joined them at Kimberley and they put him in charge of two ox-wagons carrying much-needed equipment and supplies to the mining settlements as far north as the Limpopo ('crocodile') River. Meanwhile they operated a fleet of ten ox-wagons to Potchefstroom (Orange Free State), Pretoria and the Eastern Transvaal routes. Their success led them to send for their younger brother, Christiaan Hendrik (Döel) Zeederberg, then aged 23, to assist them in coping with the expanded operations.In 1887 the partners started the first mail-coach route between Johannesburg and Kimberley. In 1890 they added a service between Pretoria, Pietersburg and the gold rush town of Leydsdorp.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{standardise}} the goods wagons classes {{of the various}} German state railways (Länderbahnen), the German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband or DWV) issued regulations.

Externally, the Verbandsbauart wagons looked very much like state railway goods wagons, but they were equipped for considerably higher maximum loads of up to 20 tons. A total of 11 classes were defined by norms defined by master engineering drawings (Musterblättern). The wagons were built in numbers that today are hardly conceivable. The most important ones were the A2 and A10 Class wagons of which over 100,000 of each type were built. The Om Class A10 wagons were, including wagons of identical construction made by other nations, the most widespread goods wagons of all time and formed the major part of the German goods <b>wagon</b> <b>fleet</b> until the 1950s.
