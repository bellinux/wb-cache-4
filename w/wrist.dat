5|$|Del Potro {{achieved}} a top-10 ranking by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) {{for the first}} time on 6 October 2008. In January 2010, he reached a career-high ranking of world No. 4, after which del Potro had to withdraw from most of the tournaments in 2010 due to a right <b>wrist</b> injury. He returned in 2011 and was back to world No. 4 in January 2014 but had to withdraw from competition due to another <b>wrist</b> injury, but this time to his left <b>wrist.</b>|$|E
5|$|None of the carpals (<b>wrist</b> bones) fit {{together}} precisely, suggesting {{the presence of}} a large amount of cartilage in the <b>wrist,</b> which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched the <b>wrist.</b> When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.|$|E
40|$|Purpose To compare {{changes in}} the largest {{cross-sectional}} area (CSA) of the median nerve in <b>wrists</b> undergoing surgical decompression with changes in <b>wrists</b> undergoing non-surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods This study was a prospective cohort study in 55 consecutive patients with 78 <b>wrists</b> with established CTS, including 60 <b>wrists</b> treated with surgical decompression and 18 <b>wrists</b> with non-surgical treatment. A sonographic examination was scheduled before and 4 months after initiation of treatment. We compared changes in CSA of the median nerve between <b>wrists</b> with surgical treatment and <b>wrists</b> with non-surgical treatment using linear regression models. Results Decreases in CSA of the median nerve were more pronounced in <b>wrists</b> with CTS release than in <b>wrists</b> undergoing nonsurgical treatment (difference in means, 1. 0 mm 2; 95...|$|R

5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the <b>wrist)</b> is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the <b>wrist</b> is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the <b>wrist.</b> The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the <b>wrist</b> to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} cartilage thickness, {{contact surface}} area, {{volume of the}} capitate {{and shape of the}} capitate during motion in the operated and unaffected <b>wrists</b> of 11 patients with a mean follow-up of 7. 3 years after proximal row carpectomy. Radiocapitate cartilage thickness in the operated <b>wrists</b> did not differ significantly from radiolunate cartilage thickness in the unaffected <b>wrists.</b> The radiolunate surface area was significantly less than the radiocapitate surface area. The volume of the capitate was significantly increased in the operated <b>wrists.</b> The shape of the capitate changed significantly in two of three orthogonal directions. The combination of remodelling of the capitate, increase in its surface area and intact cartilage thickness could help to explain the clinical success of proximal row carpectom...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is a common}} peripheral entrapment neuropathy, caused by the entrapment of the median nerve. Ultrasonography (USG) {{has been used as}} a cost-effective and comfortable technique in the examination of the carpal tunnel and the median nerve in the last decade. Material and Methods: Thirty-five <b>wrists</b> of 21 patients with the signs, symptoms and electromyelography (EMG) confirmed diagnosis of CTS and 40 <b>wrists</b> of healthy adults were evaluated by ultrasonography (USG), performed with a 7. 5 - 12 MHz transducer. Results: All of the 35 <b>wrists</b> of 21 patients with CTS diagnosed by EMG and 40 <b>wrists</b> of 20 healthy adults were diagnosed accurately. Conclusion: USG may be performed as a first step test in the diagnosis of suspected CTS...|$|R

5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's <b>wrist</b> and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's <b>wrist.</b> Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} local {{hydrocortisone}} acetate injections {{in patients with}} a carpal tunnel syndrome are reported. In a prospective study of sixty one <b>wrists</b> injected, fifty five (90 %) had initial symptomatic relief. At review after one year forty one <b>wrists</b> had relapsed (67 %) requiring decompression. In view of the poor long term response to injection {{it was decided to}} test the accuracy of the siting technique in a separate consecutive series of twenty six <b>wrists</b> at operation. The needle was found to be correctly sited in twenty four <b>wrists</b> (92 %). It is suggested thai, as initially considerable symptomatic relief can be achieved, the principal value of steroid injections lies as a palliative remedy whilst decompression is awaited...|$|R
40|$|P. A. radiographs of both <b>wrists</b> {{were taken}} in 400 normal {{individuals}} to study {{the configuration of the}} styloid process of the ulna. Five dilferent morphological variations were noticed, the commonest being an elongated process (102 <b>wrists).</b> Medially deviated (41 <b>wrists),</b> parrot beaked (27 <b>wrists)</b> and hypertrophic (16 <b>wrists)</b> patterns were less common. One person had bilateral unfused separate ossitication centres for the ulnar styloid. There was no correlation between the length of the styloid process and ulnar variance. Journal of Hand Surgery (British Volume, 1990) 15 B: 352 - 354 The styloid process of the ulna may take many shapes and sizes. An elongated process has been found to predispose to compression fracture of triquetrum (Gar-cia-Elias, 1987). A hypertrophic styloid process may be seen in rheumatoid arthritis (Cantor and Brounstein, 1987), an appearance which may also be present in otherwise asymptomatic <b>wrists.</b> The authors are not aware of any previous descriptions of variations in the pattern of the ulnar styloid. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give an account of morphological variants of the styloid process of the ulna in normal individuals. These should be recognised and should not be attributed to a pathological condition. Material and methods This study was carried out at the Department o...|$|R
