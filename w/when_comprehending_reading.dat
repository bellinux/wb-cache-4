40|$|Reading is very {{important}} for one's academic life and it is also a cheap form of entertaintment. Without the skills of reading, the transfer of information would purely rely on one's hearing ability. As such, the ability to read well is the basis for the success of one's school and any future life. Obviously, learning to read, must be emphasized from the earlier stages of one's schooling. The fact of the matter is, most students still find difficulties in <b>comprehending</b> <b>reading</b> passages. They ever consider reading as a boring subject. There have been some constraints in the teaching-learning of the reading skills. These constraints are found mainly in the students' ability to <b>comprehend</b> the <b>reading</b> passages and the teachers' techniques in teaching the reading skills. As a result, the students are not satisfied with their efforts to comprehend English passages. Based on the above mentioned reasons, the writer suggests teachers use group discussion as one of the techniques in teaching reading in classrooms. She hopes that the English teachers will make use of the information suggested here to help their students better <b>comprehend</b> <b>reading</b> passages. To be successful in using this technique, the teachers should concentrate on the types of group discussion and the design and content of group tasks. The types of group that the writer suggests here are work and problem solving because with them every student is active. Besides, the tasks for discussion should be kept simple and should contain interesting matters. Moreover, the teacher should be sure that the students are not afraid to talk and to make language errors. They should be made to learn from one another's mistakes and help out with a needed word. The procedures of carrying out the group discussion in the classroom are, among others: preparation, presentation, and evaluation. The preparation consists of finding suitable materials, arranging the time limit, dividing the students into groups, choosing the group leader, and giving clear instructions. The presentation consists of the teaching learning activities in the classroom. The evaluation here consists of assessing and fastering the student's understanding of the given passages This group discussion as a technique is one of the teacher's efforts to make his teaching more useful because it will give variation in the teaching of reading in the classroom. By using this technique, the teacher helps increase the students' ability to <b>comprehend</b> <b>reading</b> texts.

Moreover, reading is known to be advantageous, but it can make students become quiet.

This study was a quasi experimental study which was conducted by the English teachers in sixth grade of ‗Z school‘ by comparing two reading techniques; CSR and teacher centered teaching strategy. The finding showed that CSR did not give effect in mastering knowledge and comprehension level. However, this technique can be used to vary teaching reading, so the teaching will not be monotonous and to attract students‘ motivation in reading.
