5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1936, the {{management}} of the New York Philharmonic was confronted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management of the}} orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{surprised}} {{that men have}} been noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring her as they usually do. Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie is spreading a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor {{in order to get the}} attention of his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, the Metropolitan Railway built {{a branch}} from its main line at Wembley Park to Stanmore. The line, {{as with many}} others in the {{northwest}} London area, was designed to absorb commuter traffic from the new and rapidly expanding suburbs. The line presented the Metropolitan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> – so successful was the suburban traffic that, by the early 1930s, the lines into Baker Street were becoming overloaded, a problem which was exacerbated by the post-war flight from the City of London to the West End of London.|$|E

25|$|The creators found {{themselves}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{with the character}} of Lt. Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) in season two, a first season regular that the producers, and the actor himself, felt had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to write him out, the writers {{came up with an}} idea to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to recurring. To replace him, they created Ronon Dex as a sidekick for Lt. Col. John Sheppard, but finding an actor with the physical presence and the acting ability necessary was not easy until they saw Jason Momoa's tape. X-files veteran Mitch Pileggi and Kavan Smith were added to the cast in the recurring roles of Col. Steven Caldwell and Maj. Evan Lorne. Paul McGillion's character, Dr. Carson Beckett, became a regular in season two.|$|E
25|$|When using PCR in PGD, one {{is faced}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> that is {{inexistent}} in routine genetic analysis: the minute amounts of available genomic DNA. As PGD is performed on single cells, PCR {{has to be}} adapted and pushed to its physical limits, and use the minimum amount of template possible: which is one strand. This implies a long process of fine-tuning of the PCR conditions and a susceptibility to all the problems of conventional PCR, but several degrees intensified. The high number of needed PCR cycles and the limited amount of template makes single-cell PCR very sensitive to contamination. Another problem specific to single-cell PCR is the allele drop out (ADO) phenomenon. It consists of the random non-amplification {{of one of the}} alleles present in a heterozygous sample. ADO seriously compromises the reliability of PGD as a heterozygous embryo could be diagnosed as affected or unaffected depending on which allele would fail to amplify. This is particularly concerning in PGD for autosomal dominant disorders, where ADO of the affected allele could lead to the transfer of an affected embryo.|$|E

Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa’s party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to get good marks on her project, than him favoring her in any way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} tenth century, Latin had higher {{prestige}} than Anglo-Saxon, and hermeneutic Latin had higher prestige than simple Latin. This presented Byrhtferth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in his Enchiridion, a school text {{designed to teach}} the complicated rules for calculating the date of Easter, as hermeneutic Latin is unsuitable for pedagogic instruction. His solution was to include passages in hermeneutic Latin condemning the ignorant and lazy secular clergy, who he said refused to learn Latin, thus justifying using Anglo-Saxon to provide clear explanations for their benefit. In a passage in Latin he wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{issue of}} {{contention}} was compensation to the American colonies by Britain {{for the costs}} of the expedition against Louisbourg and the long occupation by American troops until the British Army finally took over. [...] This presented Shirley <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> because the expedition's leaders, including his former ally Samuel Waldo, grossly inflated their claimed costs. [...] Waldo used Shirley's unwillingness to openly act against him to begin his own efforts to topple the governor. [...] Shirley was only able to forestall this effort by promising the colonial administration that he would achieve financial stability in the province by retiring its paper currency.|$|E
500|$|Like other herbivorous lizards, the Cuban iguana is {{presented}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for osmoregulation: plant matter contains more potassium and has less nutritional content per gram than meat so more must be eaten {{to meet the}} lizard's metabolic needs. [...] Unlike those of mammals, reptile kidneys cannot concentrate urine to save on water intake. Instead, reptiles excrete toxic nitrogenous wastes as solid uric acid through their cloaca.

Coming out of {{the second round of}} pit stops, Hamilton led Räikkönen by 13seconds, Räikkönen more than 2.5seconds ahead of Massa. The gap between the Ferraris began to close, and Massa eased past Räikkönen on the back straight on lap49, to take second place on the track.

Puzzles are initiated when locating environmental cues or talking to NPCs. All puzzles revolved around four-digit numerical combinations, the correct combinations being hinted at through dialogue and other clues: an example puzzle is taking a birthday and manipulating the numbers in some way, through either physically flipping them or rearranging them, to find the correct code. The player may also need to solve math or logic problems to deduce the correct code.|$|E
500|$|Von Neumann's {{closest friend}} in the United States was {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam.

[...] When von Neumann was dying in hospital, every time Ulam would visit he would come prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer up his friend. He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively, and he would often go to sleep <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> unsolved, and know the answer immediately upon waking up. Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more of an aural one.|$|E
