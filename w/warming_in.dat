5|$|Brazil {{ordered the}} ship in 1911 as Rio de Janeiro from the British company Armstrong Whitworth. However, the {{collapse}} of Brazil's rubber boom and a <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> relations with Argentina, the country's chief rival, led to the ship's sale while under construction to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans renamed her Sultan Osman I, after the empire's founder, and the ship was nearly complete when World War I broke out. The British government seized her {{for use by the}} Royal Navy, together with another Ottoman dreadnought being constructed in Britain. This act caused resentment in the Ottoman Empire, as the payments for both ships were complete, and contributed to the decision of the Ottoman government to join the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> {{the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They {{can be caused by}} gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|Some of Antarctica {{has been}} warming up; {{particularly}} strong warming {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.|$|E

25|$|In polar {{regions that}} are {{expected}} to experience among the most rapid impact from climate warming, springtails have shown contrasting responses to <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> experimental warming studies. There are negative, positive and neutral responses reported. Neutral responses to experimental warming have also been reported in studies of non-polar regions. The importance of soil moisture has been demonstrated in experiments using infrared heating in an alpine meadow, which had a negative effect on mesofauna biomass and diversity in drier parts and a positive effect in moist sub-areas. Furthermore, a study with 20 years of experimental <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> three contrasting plant communities found that small scale heterogeneity may buffer springtails to potential climate warming.|$|E
