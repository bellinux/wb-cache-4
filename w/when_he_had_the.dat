5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell {{was once}} again traded; this time he {{returned}} to the Senators in March1944. He earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best knuckleball catchers in baseball <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> arduous task of catching for a Senators' starting pitching staff made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the unpredictability of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944American League pennant.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Golden Abyss, Guerro {{had enough}} money to equip his army with guns, turrets, {{vehicles}} and explosives, but still needed more. He was approached by an archaeologist, Vincent Perez, and his partner Jason Dante, who wished to investigate ruins within Guerro's territory on a potential lead to Quivira, one of the Seven Cities of Gold. Guerro agreed, presumably planning to kill both Perez and Dante <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> gold, which he would use to fund the revolution. After Perez's disappearance, he allowed Dante {{to take over the}} excavation only if he complied with orders. Guerro interrogates both Chase and Dante after he captures Drake. Chase manages to escape with Drake and her amulet. Guerro captures Chase and steals the sword of Stephen from Drake. Drake and Sully find the Serpent Temple where Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's thugs are fighting.Guerro wounds Chase badly before being thrown off a bridge by Nate.|$|E

5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. Vettel set the fastest times {{in the second and third}} sessions and clinched his fourth pole position of the season with a time of 1:37.587. It was the Red Bull team's eighth pole in the season's nine races. He was joined on the grid's front row by Webber who recorded a lap time 0.075 seconds slower than Vettel. Hamilton qualified third but locked his rear tyres on his final timed heading into turn 17 and slowed down, preventing him from improving his grid position. The two Ferrari drivers were fourth and fifth (with Alonso ahead of Massa); Massa encountered slower cars which prevented him from gaining optimum tyre temperature and could not improve his fastest lap time. Kubica took sixth position and felt more movement on his Renault <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> medium compound tyre equipped. Button had oversteer through turn 24 and made a mistake in the following corner which restricted him to seventh. Nico Hülkenberg was eighth, ahead of Williams teammate Barrichello in ninth who was affected by a brake-warm up problem. Petrov rounded out the top ten and made mistakes on his final timed lap which prevented him from getting a better starting position.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss, {{chose to}} bat {{and made an}} {{impressive}} start to their innings, with the opening stand being worth 133 in 39 overs. Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground.

In another case of injury-related bad luck, Willsmore was also forced to miss a match against New South Wales in 1919/20 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> webbing on his hand split open while fielding during a trial match earlier in the week.|$|E

It was difficult to find riders as skilled as McQueen. At one point, using editing, McQueen is seen in a German uniform chasing himself on another bike.

Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment she told him about.

This became his main guitar from then to 1981/82, when he switched back to the Deluxe (he can be seen with it in some footage with Motorhead). It has been his main guitar ever since. Robertson can also be seen playing a white Fender Stratocaster with black pick-guard and a black Gibson SG in mimed footage with Lizzy.|$|E

However, at least he could enjoy a relative return to stability compared to the initial years of the rebellion, especially <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity {{to spend time in}} the relative seclusion of his Lantian estate, which allowed him both a poetic and a Buddhist retreat, as well as a place to spend time with his friends and with nature, painting and writing. But, finally, his writing came to an end, and in the seventh month of 759, or in 761, Wang Wei requested writing implements, wrote several letters to his brother and to his friends, and then died. He was then buried at his Lantian estate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1940, Ribbentrop made a {{sustained}} but unsuccessful effort to have Spain enter the war on the Axis side. During his talks with the Spanish foreign minister, Ramón Serrano Súñer, Ribbentrop affronted Súñer with his tactless behaviour, especially his suggestion that Spain cede the Canary Islands to Germany. An angry Súñer replied that he would rather see the Canaries sink into the Atlantic then cede an inch of Spanish territory. An area in which Ribbentrop enjoyed more success arose in September 1940, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Far Eastern agent of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Dr. Heinrich Georg Stahmer, start negotiations with the Japanese foreign minister, Yōsuke Matsuoka, for an anti-American alliance.

25|$|In 1183 {{a general}} tax was levied {{throughout}} the kingdom, which was unprecedented in Jerusalem {{and almost all}} of medieval Europe to that point. The tax helped pay for larger armies for the next few years. More troops were certainly needed, since Saladin was finally able to gain control of Aleppo, and with peace in his northern territories he could focus on Jerusalem in the south. King Baldwin was so incapacitated by his leprosy that it was necessary to appoint a regent, and Guy of Lusignan was chosen, as he was Baldwin's legal heir and the king was not expected to live. The inexperienced Guy led the Frankish army against Saladin's incursions into the kingdom, but neither side made any real gains, and Guy was criticized by his opponents for not striking against Saladin <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, the Galerie Hans Goltz, Munich, mounted Schiele's {{first solo}} show. A solo {{exhibition}} {{of his work}} took place in Paris in 1914. During the war Schiele's paintings became larger and more detailed, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> time to produce them. His military service however gave him limited time, and much of his output consisted of linear drawings of scenery and military officers. Around this time Schiele also began experimenting with the theme of motherhood and family. His wife Edith was the model {{for most of his}} female figures, but during the war due to circumstance, many of his sitters were male. Since 1915, Schiele's female nudes had become fuller in figure, but many were deliberately illustrated with a lifeless doll-like appearance. Towards the end of his life, Schiele drew many natural and architectural subjects. His last few drawings consisted of female nudes, some in masturbatory poses.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 {{only two}} U.S. states allowed twenty round {{championship}} bouts to a verdict, Colorado and Louisiana, and no promoters in either state were offering large enough purses to risk losing the Championship title for. To earn {{as much money}} as he could from being the Champion, Welsh fought in as many ten round 'no verdict' matches as he could. As long as he was on his feet {{at the end of the}} ten rounds, he could not lose his title. Still, Welsh wanted to show he was not going to choose soft opposition and began a series of bouts against serious contenders. His first defence was against Matty Baldwin on 27 October in Boston, a match he won on points. This was followed six days later by a contest against Al Wolgast, the former champion who had avoided Welsh <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> title to lose. The fight was a near sell out at Madison Square Garden in New York, with the crowd firmly behind Wolgast. Although the first few rounds were fairly even between the two fighters, at the end of the fifth round Wolgast blocked an uppercut with his right arm. The blow broke his ulna three inches (76mm) above the wrist, forcing Wolgast to box on with just his left hand. Wolgast kept on fighting but could not continue after the eighth.|$|E
