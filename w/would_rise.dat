5|$|Initially {{with only}} three employees, this <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> to fifteen, with all working on Hergé's projects. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary {{apprentice}} at the Studios in March 1951. Impressed by Jacques Martin's work on The Golden Sphinx, Hergé persuaded Martin to join the Studios in January 1954; Martin insisted on bringing with him his own two assistants, Roger Leloup and Michel Demaurets.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than two}} years later, Beauregard <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> to {{national}} fame as the Confederate general who ordered the April 1861 assault on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, South Carolina, thus beginning the American Civil War. It was during the war that Beauregard would secure his place in American history {{as one of the}} Confederacy's most capable generals.|$|E
5|$|Mary Magdalene (alone in John, but {{accompanied}} by {{other women in}} the Synoptics) goes to Jesus' tomb on Sunday morning and is surprised to find it empty. Despite Jesus' teaching, the disciples had not understood that Jesus <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> again.|$|E

5|$|Omeljan Pritsak (1981) {{comments}} that {{among those who}} raised the memorial, the youngest son Guðvér <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> to become {{the commander of the}} Varangian Guard in the mid-11th century, as shown in a second mention of Guðvér on the runestone Sö 217. That stone was raised in memory of {{one of the members of}} Guðvér's retinue.|$|E
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it {{burned to the ground}} in 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> from the ashes of the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers {{are two of}} Antarctica's five largest ice streams. Scientists {{have found}} that the flow of these ice streams has {{accelerated}} in recent years, and suggested that if they were to melt, global sea levels <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> by , destabilising the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet and perhaps sections of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.|$|E

5|$|The {{extension}} to Golders Green {{would take the}} railway out of the urban and suburban areas and into open farmland. While this provided a convenient site for the CCE's depot {{it is believed that}} underlying the decision was Yerkes' plan to profit from the sale of development land previously purchased in the area that <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> in value when the railway opened.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Frederick Alexander Woodford (1821–1887) was {{the eldest}} son of Alexander George Woodford, a career soldier who was already a hero of Waterloo, and <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> to Field Marshal, ending his days in command of Chelsea Hospital. After a short stay in the Coldstream Guards, Adolphus entered the Anglican Church, having the living of Swillington from 1847–1872. On leaving the Army, he also became a Freemason, rising to become Grand Chaplain in 1863, {{commuting}} from Yorkshire to his London duties.|$|E

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic {{through the tunnel}} <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> on {{the completion of the}} M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels {{would not be able to}} cope with the full demands of a completed M25.|$|E
5|$|In Week 9, after {{defeating}} Wake Forest {{to improve}} to a 6–1 record, Maryland was ranked 25th {{by both the}} Associated Press and the Coaches' Polls. It {{was the first time}} the team was ranked since Week 11 in 2006. Maryland <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> in the polls, and enter the Harris and BCS rankings after beating NC State the following week. However, after the loss to Virginia Tech, the Terps fell out of the rankings altogether. Maryland made one final poll appearance after the win over North Carolina, before losing to Florida State.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, as they once had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents {{would be forced to}} pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Branham's followers {{to his death}} was one of shocking disbelief. In the confusion immediately following his death, expectations developed that he <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> from the dead. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed indefinitely. The press surmised {{that this was a}} result of Branham's expected resurrection. He was finally buried on April 11, 1966, the day after Easter Sunday, which was accepted reluctantly by his followers. Most believed {{that he would have to}} return to fulfill a vision that he had regarding future tent meetings.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} {{diplomatic}} {{spheres of influence}} resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe. The negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia's growing strength within and among the German states and so failed to foresee that Prussia <b>would</b> <b>rise</b> to challenge Austria for leadership of the German peoples. This German dualism presented two {{solutions to the problem}} of unification: Kleindeutsche Lösung, the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or Großdeutsche Lösung, the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria).|$|E
