The Progressive Conservatives won {{a majority of}} the votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland. Quebec's Union Nationale political machine had given the PC party little support, but with Quebec voters minded to support Diefenbaker, Union Nationale boss Maurice Duplessis threw the machinery of his party behind the Tories.|$|E

Whether Fechner and Benham ever actually met face to face for any reason is not known.|$|E

Zollicoffer Park contains the Confederate Cemetery, which consists of a mass grave. There is a corresponding Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy, where the Union dead were interred.|$|E

25|$|William Gossage {{produced}} low-priced, good-quality soap {{from the}} 1850s. Robert Spear Hudson began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with {{a mortar and}} pestle. American manufacturer Benjamin T. Babbitt introduced marketing innovations that included sale of bar soap and distribution of product samples. William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> {{one of the largest}} soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever.

25|$|Contrary {{to reports}} at the time, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> assumed by many, the {{collapse}} of the wall did not cause the 39 deaths. Instead, the collapse relieved pressure and allowed fans to escape. Most died of suffocation after tripping or being crushed against the wall before the collapse. A further 600 fans were also injured. Bodies were carried out from the stadium on sections of iron fencing and laid outside, covered with giant football flags. As police and medical helicopters flew in, the down-draught blew away the modest coverings.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{cellular}} automata {{were studied}} as {{a particular type}} of dynamical system and the connection with the mathematical field of symbolic dynamics was established for the first time. In 1969, Gustav A. Hedlund compiled many results following this point of view in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered as a seminal paper for the mathematical study of cellular automata. The most fundamental result is the characterization in the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem of the set of global rules of cellular automata as the set of continuous endomorphisms of shift spaces.|$|E

25|$|Post {{independence}} ornithology {{was dominated}} by Salim Ali and his cousin Humayun Abdulali who worked with the Bombay Natural History Society. Salim Ali worked with American collaborators like Sidney Dillon Ripley and Walter Norman Koelz to produce <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the most comprehensive handbook of Indian ornithology. Another major contribution was the introduction of field ornithology and pioneers included Horace Alexander. The Zoological Survey of India also conducted its own collection surveys and they were led by Biswamoy Biswas. Eastern India and Burma was covered by ornithologists like Bertram E. Smythies.|$|E
25|$|Bohr's {{argument}} about the impossibility of using the apparatus proposed by Einstein to violate the principle of indeterminacy depends crucially {{on the fact that}} a macroscopic system (the screen S1) obeys quantum laws. On the other hand, Bohr consistently held that, in order to illustrate the microscopic aspects of reality, it is necessary to set off a process of amplification, which involves macroscopic apparatuses, whose fundamental characteristic is that of obeying classical laws and which can be described in classical terms. This ambiguity would later come back in the form of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> called today the measurement problem.|$|E
25|$|In 1797, Trinidad was {{invaded by}} a British force under General Sir Ralph Abercromby. The British landed west of Port of Spain, at <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> called Invaders Bay, and marched towards the town. Realising his {{military}} resources were inadequate {{to defend the}} colony and wishing to avoid unnecessary destruction, Governor Chacón capitulated {{and was able to}} negotiate generous terms with Abercromby. Port of Spain remained the capital; the new British colonial government renamed most of the streets after British royalty or military figures, but allowed Chacón Street (which followed the old course of the St. Ann's River) to retain its name, in tribute to the former governor.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1932–33 season, the Austrian ex-international footballer Karl Kurz took over as club trainer. There were eight teams in Group 1 of the 1932–33 Nationalliga. Basel finished the season in second position in the table, with seven victories from 14 games. The play-off game between the second placed teams from both groups was held in Basel at the Stadion Rankhof, but the home team lost 3–4 to Servette FC Genève. In the Swiss Cup, Basel advanced to the final, which was played in the Hardturm in Zürich. Basel won 4–3 and thus their first ever national title, defeating arch-rivals and reigning cup-holders Grasshoppers in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered {{to be one of the}} best cup finals in Swiss football history.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year was {{nothing short of}} a sensation. Lohmann not only became Surrey's leading bowler, but was the leading first-class wicket-taker with 142 wickets. He also showed his promise as a batsman was no fluke, for he scored 571 runs. In 1886, Lohmann did equally well and played his first Test matches for England against Australia. He took only one wicket at Old Trafford, and none at Lord's, but his continued superb form in other first-class matches saw him retained for the last match at The Oval. Here, Lohmann established himself as a great bowler with a superb twelve for 104 (7 for 36 and 5 for 68), giving England <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> one of its most decisive wins in an Ashes series. Again being the leading first-class wicket-taker, Lohmann was chosen to tour Australia with Alfred Shaw's team.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the short}} term the fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his {{advertising}} for Coke, saying his commercials that praised the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility, no one at Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held responsible for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> widely perceived as a misstep, {{for the simple reason that}} it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.|$|E
