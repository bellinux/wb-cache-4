5000|$|The king stropharia {{can grow}} to 20 cm high with a reddish-brown convex to {{flattening}} cap up to 30 cm across, the size leading to another colloquial name godzilla mushroom. The gills are initially pale, then grey, and finally dark purple-brown in colour. The firm flesh is white, {{as is the}} tall stem which bears a <b>wrinkled</b> <b>ring.</b> This is {{the origin of the}} specific epithet which means [...] "wrinkled-ringed".|$|E
50|$|The ovate, conica {{shell is}} {{transversely}} striated. It is of a reddish white color. The pointed spire is, composed of nine angular whorls, depressed at their upper part, {{where they are}} surrounded by a sort of <b>wrinkled</b> <b>ring.</b> The whorls of the spire, {{with the exception of}} the last, are by no means convex. The whitish aperture is ovate and emarginated at its base. The thin outer lip is sharp, forming a small canal at its upper and internal part at its union with the left lip. The columella is white.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{demonstration}} of wrinkled membranes {{as a kind}} of optical focusing devices, which are low cost, light weight and flexible. Our device consists of concentric <b>wrinkle</b> <b>rings</b> on a gold-PDMS bilayer membrane, which converts collimated illuminations to diffraction-free focused beams. Beam diameters of 300 - 400 μm have been observed in the visible range. By comparing the theoretically calculated and experimentally measured focal spot profiles, we predict a focal spot size as small as around 50 μm if fabrication eccentricity can be eliminated.

60|$|This Zoophyte twines itself parasitically upon {{a species}} of Sertularia. The cells in this species are thrown out at {{irregular}} intervals upon flexible stems which are <b>wrinkled</b> in <b>rings.</b> They consist of lengthened, cylindrical, transparent vases.|$|R
50|$|Ghost craters are impact craters {{that have}} been filled with {{volcanic}} deposits. Ghost craters can be observed {{on the surface of}} the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and may possibly exist on Venus. On Mercury, ghost craters are most commonly found in the northern hemisphere of the planet in the smooth plains. There are three types of ghost craters on Mercury. Type one ghost craters contains a wrinkle ridge that forms a ring while type two ghost craters contain a <b>wrinkle</b> ridge <b>ring</b> and graben in the interior. Type three ghost crater's <b>wrinkle</b> ridge <b>ring</b> either does not exist or can not be observed. Instead, it has a ring of graben along its border.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of sipunculan worms from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale, near Kunming (southwest China). Their sipunculan identity {{is evidenced by the}} general morphology of the animals (sausage-shaped body with a slender retractable introvert and a wider trunk) and by other features, both external (e. g. perioral crown of tentacles, and hooks, papillae and <b>wrinkle</b> <b>rings</b> on the body surface) and internal (U-shaped gut, and the anus opening near the introvert-trunk junction). The three fossil forms (Archaeogolfingia caudata gen. et sp. nov., Cambrosipunculus tentaculatus gen. et sp. nov. and Cambrosipunculus sp.) have striking similarities to modern sipunculans, especially the Golfingiidae to which their evolutionary relationships are discussed. This study suggests that most typical features of extant sipunculans have undergone only limited changes since the Early Cambrian, thus indicating a possible evolutionary stasis over the past 520 Myr...|$|R

60|$|On {{turning her}} head and seeing a stranger, she {{appeared}} very much startled. From her slender figure Miss Haldin had taken her for a young girl; but if her face was almost childishly round, it was also sallow and <b>wrinkled,</b> with dark <b>rings</b> under the eyes. A thick crop of dusty brown hair was parted boyishly on the side with a lateral wave above the dry, furrowed forehead. After a moment of dumb blinking, she suddenly squatted down on the floor.|$|R
40|$|Many {{microbial}} species form multicellular structures comprising elaborate <b>wrinkles</b> and concentric <b>rings,</b> yet {{the rules}} governing their architecture are poorly understood. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces phenazines, small molecules that act as alternate electron acceptors to oxygen and nitrate to oxidize the intracellular redox state and that influence biofilm morphogenesis. Here, we show that the depth occupied by cells within colony biofilms correlates well with electron acceptor availability. Perturbations in the environmental provision, endogenous production, and utilization of electron acceptors affect colony development {{in a manner consistent}} with redox control. Intracellular NADH levels peak before the induction of colony wrinkling. These results suggest that redox imbalance is a major factor driving the morphogenesis of P. aeruginosa biofilms and that wrinkling itself is an adaptation that maximizes oxygen accessibility and thereby supports metabolic homeostasis. This type of redox-driven morphological change is reminiscent of developmental processes that occur in metazoans...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} analytical approach and numerical {{study on the}} stability of a ring bound to an annular elastic substrate, which contains a circular cavity. The system is loaded by depressurizing the inner cavity. The ring is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam and its equilibrium equations are derived from the mechanical energy which takes into account both stretching and bending contributions. The curvature of the substrate is considered explicitly to model the work done by its reaction force on the ring. We distinguish two different instabilities: periodic <b>wrinkling</b> of the <b>ring</b> or global buckling of the structure. Our model provides an expression for the critical pressure, {{as well as a}} phase diagram that rationalizes the transition between instability modes. Towards assessing the role of curvature, we compare our results for the critical stress and the wrinkling wavelength to their planar counterparts. We show that the critical stress is insensitive to the curvature of the substrate, while the wavelength is only affected due to the permissible discrete values of the azimuthal wavenumber imposed by the geometry of the problem. Throughout, we contrast our analytical predictions against finite element simulations. Comment: 34 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose : The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the degree of expression of virulence factors such as adherence, cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and production of proteinase by different morphological forms of Candida albicans causing oral candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected individuals. Methods : C. albicans 3153 A and two strains isolated from oral thrush in HIV infected individuals were induced to undergo phenotypic switching by exposure to UV light and the degree of expression of virulence factors by the different morphological forms was studied. Results : Three different morphological forms of C. albicans were obtained namely, star (S), <b>wrinkled</b> (W) and <b>ring</b> (R) types from the original smooth (O) variety. It was found that proteinase production was greatest with the W type followed by the R type and O type. The S type produced the least proteinase. Expression of cell surface hydrophobicity and adherence was greatest in the O type followed by the R and then the W type and finally the S type. Conclusions : The differential expression of virulence factors occurs with different phenotypic forms of C. albicans and this may provide a particular morphological type with a distinct advantage over other types in causing candidiasis...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} macrophages {{in the development of}} posterior capsule opacification (PCO). METHODS: For this purpose, an extracapsular lens extraction was performed in 18 consecutive Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were treated with liposomal clodronate (Cl(2) MDP-lip-treated group, n = 10) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (control group, n = 8) 1 day preoperatively and on the first day postoperatively, and sacrificed 3 days postoperatively. Masked clinical, light microscopy and immunohistochemistry studies were conducted. The Fisher exact test and randomisation test were used to assess statistically differences between groups. RESULTS: A statistically significant {{reduction in the number of}} macrophages (ED 1 +, ED 7 +, ED 8 +) was found in the Cl(2) MDP-lip-treated group compared with the PBS-lip-treated group (p = 0. 048, p = 0. 004, p = 0. 027, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences with regards to the presence/absence of central opacification (p = 0. 29) and capsular wrinkling (p = 0. 21) as detected clinically between groups. Similarly, a qualitative evaluation of the degree of PCO with regards to lens epithelial cell (LEC) proliferation, capsular <b>wrinkling</b> and Soemmerring <b>ring</b> formation showed no statistically significance between groups (p = 0. 27, p = 0. 061, p = 1. 0, respectively). However, a statistically significant reduction in the number of lens epithelial cells (LEC) counted in the centre of the posterior capsule was found in the Cl(2) MDP-lip-treated group (p = 0. 009). CONCLUSION: Depletion of macrophages was accompanied by a reduction in LEC in the centre of the posterior capsule in rodents...|$|R
