5|$|With the {{assistance}} of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search and rescue operation. American special agents from the FBI, fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially-equipped Dutch Air Force F-16 aircraft participated in the search. In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body. Her remains were not found. On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made. The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, {{under the influence of}} marijuana, saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body. Van der Sloot later denied that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into sexual slavery. He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru.|$|E
5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E

25|$|Haig was in England from 12 March. On 14 March, at {{a meeting}} at Downing Street, warning of serious {{manpower}} problems by June “if (sic) the Germans attacked”. Bonar Law and Lloyd George, by Haig’s account, {{tried to get him}} to say that the Germans would not attack. They accused Haig of having said that there would not be a major German offensive (which was not actually <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> – he had said it would be “a gambler’s throw”) but agreed to shelve the General Reserve for the time being until enough American troops had arrived. On the same day Haig attended two long sessions of the Supreme War Council (at one of which, to his amusement, Clemenceau told Foch to shut up). On 15 Haig took part in a long discussion about the bombing of German cities, which he regarded as a waste of effort. That night Doris gave birth to his son Dawyck. He returned to France the next day.|$|E

It had become [...] "too important". Ian St John agreed that [...] "much of Shankly's behaviour was bizarre", but everything was done with a purpose because [...] "Shankly always {{knew what he was}} doing and what he was saying".|$|E

500|$|Howarth stated, [...] "I {{was happy}} to get the part of Todd, {{but it was the}} furthest thing from the fabric of my personality." [...] In an {{interview}} later that year, with Soap Opera Weekly, he grimaced when reminded of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> and commented, [...] "What a totally self-involved, pretentious thing to say." [...] He clarified his previous statement, saying that although he seemed to be consistently cast as a [...] "bad guy" [...] and as a [...] "Greek frat brother-type", both his upbringing and experiences in college were different than those of Todd and his other roles. [...] For example, Howarth was not in a fraternity in college, and, unlike Todd and his previous soap opera roles, Kent in Loving and Jory on Guiding Light, status was unimportant to him.|$|E
500|$|Wilde's {{friends had}} advised {{him against the}} {{prosecution}} at a Saturday Review meeting at the Café Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that [...] "they are going to prove sodomy against you" [...] and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying [...] "it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome {{a day or so}} before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.|$|E

Following Chrono Trigger, Mitsuda composed the soundtrack for , again with Uematsu. According to Uematsu, Mitsuda again worked {{so much that he}} eventually defecated blood out of stress and physical problems. Mitsuda worked on three more titles for Square: Tobal No. 1 and [...] both in 1996, and Xenogears in 1998, which featured the first ballad in a Square game, the Celtic ending theme [...] "Small Two of Pieces" [...] sung by Joanne Hogg. Mitsuda also during this period produced albums of arranged music of his original scores, creating acid jazz remixes in [...] and a Celtic arrangement album of Xenogears music, Creid. In July 1998, following up on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in his original interview with the company, Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer, the first of several of Square's composers to do so.|$|E

500|$|Mateiu Caragiale's {{personal}} life has for long attracted {{interest for the}} traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as [...] "made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one never knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> what he had meant to say, what he is thinking." [...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively". In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, {{in addition to his}} self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale's obsession with death had developed into [...] "neurosis".|$|E
500|$|Following summer break, Takao {{returns to}} school and spots Yukari. His friends inform him {{that she is a}} {{literature}} teacher and that she had been the target of gossip and bullying. Out of kindness and to avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears and be able to [...] "walk" [...] again. However, Yukari quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'yōshū Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love following dinner, Yukari is visibly moved, but then reminds him that she is a teacher and tells him that she is moving back to her home town on Shikoku. After Takao abruptly excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him, finding him in the stairwell. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her.|$|E
