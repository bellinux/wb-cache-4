By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} season episode [...] "Duets", she asks Santana to be her partner for the duet {{competition}} while they are making out. Santana rejects her, so Brittany attempts to make her jealous by dating fellow glee club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale). She sleeps with Artie, but Santana tells him that Brittany was just using him for his voice, so he breaks up with her, to Brittany's dismay. Brittany's relationship with Artie continues to develop; in [...] "Never Been Kissed", he gets her {{to go out with}} him again. As of [...] "Furt", they are officially dating. In [...] "Sexy", following her performance of [...] "Landslide" [...] with Santana and Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), Santana admits her true feelings for Brittany. Although Santana fears being ostracized by the McKinley High student body for being in a same-sex relationship, she confesses her romantic love to Brittany, feelings which are reciprocated. However, Brittany states that she loves Artie too, and <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to hurt him, even if it means not being able to be with Santana. She says that if she and Artie ever break up, she would be Santana's, proudly so.|$|E

[...] My comments were not directed toward any group or people but at the false message and, specifically, the method by which it has been delivered.|$|R
5000|$|While Death and Albert {{seem to get}} on rather well, it is {{a fragile}} relationship. In Mort, Albert returns to the world to help Death, but seems ready to attack him when {{it looks like he}} has his former job as Archchancellor back. He also seems not to trust Death with his life-timer, which is why he takes it with him in Soul Music, despite Death later {{reflecting}} that such an action was pointless as he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to it. Frequently, Albert finds himself trying to keep Death [...] "on course" [...] when his master becomes too human. He and Susan do not get on very well.|$|R
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going to go right for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cartwright {{denied any}} wrongdoing; his attorney, Gregory B. Craig, said in March 2015 that Cartwright had {{no contact with}} federal {{investigators}} for over a year. Craig stated: [...] "General Cartwright has done nothing wrong. He has devoted his entire life to defending the United States. He <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to weaken our national defense or undermine our national security. Hoss Cartwright is a national treasure, a genuine hero and a great patriot." ...|$|E
2500|$|China {{has denied}} accusations of cyberwarfare, and has accused the United States of {{engaging}} in cyberwarfare against it, accusations which the United States denies. Wang Baodong of the Chinese Embassy in the United States responded that the accusations {{are a result of}} sinophobic paranoia. He states that, [...] "China <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to harm sovereignty or security of other countries. In conformity with such national policies, the Chinese government has never employed, nor will it employ so-called civilian hackers in collecting information or intelligence of other countries. Allegations against China in this respect are totally unwarranted, which only reflect the dark mentality of certain people who always regard China as a threat." ...|$|E

There she was now enthroned, deified; that she would always be there I accepted. That I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> say or <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> not in consonance with her {{standards}} I knew. That I would suffer much I was sure, but the lees of that suffering I should hoard because they came from her.|$|R
2500|$|On June 29, 2007, Jo Hovind {{was sentenced}} to one year of imprisonment, three years of {{supervision}} upon release and fined $8,000. In court, Jo Hovind offered explanations for the 45 checks just under $10,000 and for checks cashed {{before and after the}} reporting deadline, telling the judge [...] "I really did not have a leadership role in CSE" [...] and finished [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> knowingly <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> illegal." [...] The judge said that while Hovind was the principal authority at CSE, Jo managed the payroll; she had cashed roughly 200 checks totaling $1.5 million over a four-year period, relying on cash to avoid IRS scrutiny. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied both appeals on December 30, 2008, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari on November 2, 2009.|$|R

[...] "Yes," [...] she began, [...] "it's just as I supposed; it was that worthless fellow who put him up to it. Of course, it began with those fool books he's been reading, and the notions that Miss Rasmith put into his head. But he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> if it hadn't been for Mr. Trannel." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{his return}} for Yorkshire, he {{struggled}} for form and was {{left out of}} the England Test and ODI squads to face Sri Lanka. In the County Championship he managed 25wickets at an average of 41.00. In September, Shahzad was reprimanded for scuffing the pitch during the penultimate Championship match against Warwickshire and fined £750. The club was relegated from the First Division in the final match of the season. Shahzad regretted the incident, explaining [...] "It's not the way I want to play my game. I don't {{want to be seen as}} a cheat, or a pitch-damager.... It's one mistake I've made in an eight- or nine-year career so far. It's out of the blue for me, and I definitely <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> like it again. It was just a random, stupid act." [...] Despite a trying year, Shahzad was selected in the England Performance Programme held over the English off-season.|$|E

5000|$|Igors have a {{particular}} code of honour, which makes them very loyal and hard-working. The code is explicit on certain matters: Never question the master ("No, thur, that'th an artery"); never pass judgment ("What {{do you want a}} hundred virginth for?"); never grumble ("Where am I going to find a brain at thith time of night?"). If an Igor spent any time in making value judgements, he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> get <b>anything</b> <b>done.</b> They will continue their servitude even if they disapprove of their master's work, but their faith is merely strong, not boundless. When the mob comes, they leave out the back, and certain activities sicken them to a point that they can consider breaking the code. In the words of one of the founding Igors: [...] "We belong dead? Excuthe me? Where doeth it thay 'we'?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sir Benjamin [...] "Ben" [...] Wyatt KBE is a {{character}} portrayed by Adam Scott in the TV series Parks and Recreation. The character guest starred in two episodes of season two and was upgraded to a series regular in season three. Ben is a state auditor who comes into Pawnee with Chris Traeger to evaluate the town's funds {{at the end of}} the second season. Compared with the exuberant Chris, Ben is very serious and straightforward, willing to tell the truth no matter how harsh; the two used to do budget meetings individually, but it didn't work out because Chris <b>would</b> <b>never</b> get <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> and Ben received multiple death threats. Ben began dating Leslie Knope in the season three episode [...] "Road Trip" [...] and married her in the season five episode [...] "Leslie and Ben."

40|$|When I {{finished}} high school (gymnasium), I said I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> concerned with natural sciences or technology, {{it was just too}} boring. I kept my word for seven years, during which I worked as a cinema projectionist and got a B. A. (fil. kand.) in philosophy. I loved it. Then I realized I had to get a job, and since philosophers were not in high demand at the time, I sat down and considered the alternatives. I made a list of educations I could get and the jobs they would lead to and I wrote them down in order of priority based on what I thought I would endure best. Then I applied. At {{the top of the list}} was M. D. but my grades were only almost good enough so I didn’t get in. In second place I had put down computer engineer and there I got in. I figured I would just barely make it through and then I would get a job. Not a dream job, but it would pay the rent. I didn’t just barely make it through, it went very well. Little by little something happened that surprised me more that anyone. I started to enjoy mathematics. When we got to choose courses I directed my education towards mathematics and when I took my first course in mathematical image analysis for Kalle Åström I felt that this was it, this was what I wanted to do. So I took some more courses and then I decided to do my master...|$|R
5000|$|Several Kannada organisations staged {{protests in}} front of theatres since they felt that some {{dialogue}} in {{a scene from the}} Hindi film Singham [...] starring Ajay Devgan and Prakash were derogatory against the Kannadigas. The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) had demanded the deletion of all [...] "objectionable" [...] dialogue from the movie. The screening was stopped in major centres of Karnataka. The controversial scene starts off with Prakash threatening Ajay that he would bring 1,000 people from Karnataka border to thrash him. Ajay (who plays Bhajirao Singham, a Maratha) retorts that one lion would suffice to shoo away a thousand dogs. The controversy assumes significance in the backdrop of the decades-old border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra. Kannada protesters also felt that Prakash, being a Kannadiga should have told the team that it is not right. Prakash reacted to it to the Kannada and the Telugu media by saying, [...] "I am a Kannadiga myself and I love my mother tongue Kannada. I'm very proud of my community and <b>would</b> <b>never</b> deliberately <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to hurt my people How would I allow conversations that provide pain to people of Karnataka in any movie in which I am cast? There is nothing controversial about the dialogue. I am a Maratha in the movie, the controversy has started just because I am a Kannadiga and I used the word 'Karnataka border' in the film because the villain in the film stays in Goa, the Karnataka border." [...] Finally the dialogue was removed, and the whole team of Singham including the director, Rohit Shetty, production house 'Reliance Big Entertainment' and Prakash apologised to all the Kannadigas; the issue was resolved.|$|R
5000|$|Frankie was {{protective}} of Jake after his split from Nancy, {{not knowing that}} Jake had tried to rape Nancy on their wedding night. When Nancy files for custody of Charlie, Frankie was furious, claiming that they were Charlie's real family. While Jack and Steph began to notice Jake's increasingly erratic behaviour, Frankie still stood at his side. She vented her anger at Nancy and Justin, who she blamed for trying to ruin Jake's life, especially after Nancy accused Jake of rape. When Steph came forward and revealed that she had walked in on Jake attempting to rape Nancy, Frankie began to blame her, telling her she was turning her back on her family, despite Jack, Steph and Newt {{trying to make her}} see reason. It wasn't until later at the hospital that Jake revealed that he did try and rape Nancy. Horrified that Jake could do this she finally sees her son for what he is. She left him alone to say goodbye to Charlie before taking him to the police. Jake later abducted Charlie and attempted to kill himself and Charlie by gassing them in a car in the woods. Frankie began to frantically search for her son. She later found Nancy with Charlie and demanded to know where Jake was, who Nancy had left in the car to die. At the car that Jake was in, Frankie discovered Jake was gone. She later admitted she was scared for him, knowing that he would try and kill himself again. Jake tried to blame his descent into madness on his father walking out on the family three years earlier; however, Frankie told him that [...] "your father may have been a naive and reckless man; but, for all his faults, Johnno <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> as bad as what you have done".|$|R

She had enjoyed the comfortable security of her station, had shared her mother's ambitions, and looked upon marriage as a means of rising in the social scale. Her adventurous temperament had found some scope in exciting sports and in an occasional flirtation that she did not carry far; but she was now beginning to feel that life had strange and wonderful things to offer those who had the courage to seize them. She had never experienced passion--perhaps because her training had taught her to dread it; but her imagination was now awake.|$|E
