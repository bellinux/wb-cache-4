'We {{had to do}} that {{in the middle of the}} night, in order to get our twenty-six oboes together.' The recording, issued in 1959, was {{received}} with critical acclaim for attempting to reproduce the sound Handel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> rather than the smoother orchestral arrangements usually played at that time.|$|E

But nothing indicates when the documents were created.

500|$|... "Kitsunegari" [...] {{serves as}} a sequel to the third season episode [...] "Pusher". The episode's title means [...] "Fox hunt" [...] in Japanese. Minear's {{original}} story for the episode was one where a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man. Series creator Frank Spotnitz suggested that Minear should use fan favorite Robert Modell.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Hendrix {{told the}} {{journalist}} Keith Altham that [...] "Third Stone from the Sun" [...] {{is about a}} visiting space alien who, upon evaluation of the human species, decides {{that people are not}} fit to rule Earth, destroys their civilization, and places the planet in the care of chickens. The song is composed of two contrasting sections, one that features a jazzy guitar melody played in the style of Wes Montgomery over a straightforward rock tempo, and another that showcases Hendrix's free-form mixolydian mode guitar lines with a jazz beat. The track contains no proper vocals, instead using spoken words played at half-speed to invoke images of interstellar space travel. In addition to jazz elements, Unterberger identified Hendrix's use of surf music motifs in the track that are reminiscent of earlier works by the Ventures, a group from the Pacific Northwest that Hendrix <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> during his childhood.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E

500|$|Of Wolfgang's music {{composed}} {{during the}} tour, around thirty pieces survive. A number of [...] works are lost, including the Zürich cello pieces and several symphonies. The surviving works include the keyboard sonatas written in Paris, London and The Hague, four symphonies, various arias, the assorted music {{written for the}} Prince of Orange, a Kyrie, and other minor pieces. Mozart's career as a symphonist began in London where, {{in addition to the}} direct influences of Abel and J.C. Bach, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> symphonies from leading London composers including Thomas Arne, William Boyce and Giuseppe Sammartini"a nearly ideal introduction to the genre", according to Zaslaw. The earliest symphonies, Zaslaw points out, while not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces, are comparable in length, complexity and originality to those written at the same time by the acknowledged symphonic masters of the day. Indeed, Abel's Symphony No. 6 in E Flat was similar enough in style and technique to be mistaken as Mozart's, and is listed as such (Symphony No. 3, K. 18) in the original Köchel catalogue. Sadie observes that the K. 22 symphony composed in The Hague is a good deal more sophisticated than the earlier ones which were written in London.|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{was shot}} {{multiple}} {{times in a}} drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13, 1996 of complications from the gunshot wounds. Rumors of Wallace's involvement with Shakur's murder were reported almost immediately. A two-part series Chuck Philips wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2002, [...] "Who Killed Tupac Shakur?", based on police reports and multiple sources reported that [...] "the shooting {{was carried out by}} a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier" [...] and that Wallace paid for the gun. His family publicly denied the report, producing documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time. The New York Times called the documents inconclusive, stating: The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the night Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> about it, Mr. Alfred said." [...] Moreover, Philips' article was based on multiple sources. As the Assistant Managing Editor of the LA Times Mark Duvoisin wrote: [...] "Philips' story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy, ... remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying." [...] Faith Evans remembered her husband calling her the night of Shakur's death and crying due to him being in shock. Evans added, [...] "I think it’s fair to say he was probably afraid, given everything that was going on at that time and all the hype that was put on this so-called beef that he didn’t really have in his heart against anyone." [...] Wayne Barrow, Wallace's co-manager at the time, said Wallace was recording the song [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] the night Shakur was shot. Shortly after Shakur's death, he met with Snoop Dogg, who claimed that Wallace played the song [...] "Somebody Gotta Die" [...] for him, in which Snoop Dogg was mentioned, and declared he never hated Shakur.|$|E

According to him, there had been no extensive shelling of the Georgian villages on the evening or night of August 7. Young added, that if there had been shelling of Georgian villages that evening, the OSCE monitors at the scene <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> it.

2500|$|As {{one of the}} chaplains-in-ordinary to the queen, Overall was {{appointed}} by Whitgift in 1598 to preach before her on the third Wednesday of Lent, 15 March, in place of Bishop Godfrey Goldsborough of Gloucester.

2500|$|Stephen Greenblatt {{acknowledges}} the convention that the [...] "equivocator" [...] {{arriving at the}} gate of hell in the Porter's speech in Macbeth is {{a reference to the}} Jesuit Father Henry Garnet, who had been executed in 1606. He argues that Shakespeare probably included the allusion for the sake of topicality, trusting that his audience <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of Garnet's pamphlet on equivocation, and not from any hidden sympathy for the man or his cause – indeed the portrait is not a sympathetic one. Literary editor Bishop Warburton declared that in the mind of Jacobean playgoers the policy of equivocation, adopted as an official doctrine of the Jesuits, would have been a direct reminder of Catholic treason in the [...] "Gunpowder plot". Shakespeare may have also been aware of the [...] "equivocation" [...] concept which appeared as the subject of a 1583 tract by Queen Elizabeth's chief councillor Lord Burghley, and the 1584 Doctrine of Equivocation by the Spanish prelate Martin Azpilcueta that was disseminated across Europe and into England in the 1590s.|$|E

Isaac also made a point to revise his will on 24 November 1512 in which he requested that a mass be said every year forever at Santissima Annunziata or another church should Annunziata be unable. [...] Bartolomea would be able to pay for these masses with provisions. He was given an honorary position as chief of the polyphic chapel at Santa Maria del Fiore on 30 May 1514, which served as a pension.

In 1517, Pope Leo X made a visit to Florence, where he almost certainly <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> Isaac's music performed. [...] Shortly before his death, Isaac wrote a third and final will, which shortened his previous request to instead have a commemorative mass said every year for ten years. [...] Isaac died on 26 March 1517. [...] Santissima Annunziata received payment the following day to hold his funeral. [...] A last posthumous donation was made to the confraternity of Santa Barbara in the amount of five florins, which was equal to one quarter the value of Isaac's home.
