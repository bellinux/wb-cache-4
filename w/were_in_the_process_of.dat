5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their {{attack on the}} Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was {{to take control of}} the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E

Prior to the outbreak of war, the IAF had been preparing for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian positions, but this {{was rejected by the}} Israeli government. 69 Squadron aircraft <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> re-armament to the air-to-air role when hostilities began at 14:00 on October 6, 1973. The aircraft were scrambled to perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties {{on the first day of}} the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the Golan Heights.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, vocalist Adam Lazzara said Taking Back Sunday were {{preparing}} to write the follow-up album to Louder Now (2006). In July, bassist Matthew Rubano mentioned that {{the other members of}} the band <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> writing individually in separate locations: Rubano in Manhattan, Lazzara in Texas, guitarist Fred Mascherino in Jersey, drummer Mark O'Connell on Long Island and guitarist Eddie Reyes in Ohio. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour. During the tour, they brought along a mobile recording studio and demoed material, and continued writing for their next album. Plans to do serious writing, as well as record their next album towards the end of the year, were in place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the earthquake, most of South Africa's major banks and insurance companies had begun receiving insurance claims. By 6August 2014, ABSA had received 200 claims, Standard Bank had received 129 claims and Mutual & Federal had received 11 claims. A survey of 17 insurance companies done by finance website Justmoney showed that 5 out of the 17 companies surveyed would reject insurance claims related to the earthquake if it was proven to be mining-related. In {{a response to the}} Survey, ABSA, who was on the list of 5, affirmed that they have received approximately 1100 claims and <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> finalising them.|$|E

Five Zeros {{were launched}} at 08:15 and three intercepted a dozen Midway-based United States Army B-17 Flying Fortresses attempting {{to bomb the}} three other carriers from , but only limited damage was inflicted on the heavy bombers, although their attacks all missed. Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time. Another trio of Zeros were launched at 08:30. Kaga began landing her returning Midway strike force aboard around 08:35 and was finished by 08:50; one Zero pilot died after crash-landing his aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff's most {{prominent}} showing in his debut season {{was in the}} Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales during the Christmas period of 1956. At the time, the two states were by far the strongest in Australia; in the past decade, the teams had 18 of the 20 top-two Shield placings between them, and New South Wales <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> winning nine consecutive titles. The arch-rivals were at full strength as no international matches were held during the season.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had at its {{disposal}} fifty {{divisions in}} France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> formation in Germany. Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the Eastern Front, meant that the Germans {{no longer had a}} pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen (eastern legions)– conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union. They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport. Many German units were under strength.|$|E

5|$|Scapa Flow {{provided}} the main anchorage for the British Grand Fleet {{throughout most of}} the First World War, but in the interwar period this passed to Rosyth, more conveniently located further south in the Firth of Forth. Scapa Flow was reactivated {{with the advent of the}} Second World War, becoming a base for the British Home Fleet. Its natural and artificial defences, while still strong, were recognised as in need of improvement, and in the early weeks of the war <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> being strengthened by the provision of additional blockships.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole {{in the center of the}} disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E
5|$|The Hessians, in {{the center}} {{under the command of}} General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines {{stationed}} at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan. The Hessian brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> outflanking the American lines at that time. The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E

5|$|The Prussian {{army was}} {{in the throes of}} reorganisation.

The Landwehr were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state. Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance– guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{staples of}} the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were {{supplemented}} {{with a wide}} variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and tomatoes. Cotton seeds <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.|$|E
