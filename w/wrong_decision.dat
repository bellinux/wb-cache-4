Carpentier was vocal in his criticism of the organisation of the track, saying that the track personnel should have been ready a month before the race was held, while Kanaan admitted that he was concerned, feeling that the situation was not good for everyone. The 15,000 spectators who were in attendance on Thursday were issued cash refunds.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added to it as the story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a <b>wrong</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the <b>wrong</b> <b>decision.</b> Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E

Early in the second half, Robin Söder restored Göteborg's lead but Basel fought back, with Scott Chipperfield equalising. Then Basel got a penalty due to a supposed hands ball in the box.
