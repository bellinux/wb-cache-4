25|$|There are few certain {{facts of}} van der Weyden's life. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> known of him {{has come from}} civic records and {{secondary}} sources, {{and some of it}} is contestable. However the paintings now attributed to him are generally accepted, despite a tendency in the 19th century to attribute his work to others.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{his works}} also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you start thinking about <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become {{the title of the}} painting.|$|E
25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular knowledge, and the a priori being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, when what is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to objective knowledge besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before knowledge can be objective, it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E

500|$|On 1 November 2012, Novakovic {{confirmed}} {{that she would}} be leaving Neighbours to pursue acting opportunities in the United States. Of her decision to leave the serial, Novakovic stated [...] "Australia is small compared to <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> out there, especially in Los Angeles. I love acting and it's what I want to do, so why not be in the thick of it all? I certainly love to do more Aussie things but, being realistic, there is nowhere near as much opportunity here." [...] During her first interview since announcing her departure, Novakovic explained that her main reasons for leaving Neighbours were to try other things and explore different characters. The actress said that she had wanted to do two years with the show, but when the time came, she decided to stay for another year to prepare herself to leave.|$|E
500|$|Stefani's {{presence}} as a featured artist on the song received negative reviews from music critics. About.com's Ivan Rott {{commented that the}} song's funk-influenced sound [...] "definitely [...] ", but was disappointed in Stefani's contribution, finding its repetition tedious. Evan McGarvey of Stylus Magazine also found it repetitive, and described [...] "Can I Have It Like That" [...] as [...] "a brief distillation of everything calamitous about [...] and Chad Hugo's production style". The Guardian stated that Stefani's part was the only catchy hook on In My Mind, but added that it [...] "seems to be built around a one-line cast-off found on the Love. Angel. Music. Baby. factory floor." [...] Finding [...] "Can I Have It Like That" [...] a [...] "slow burner" [...] that offered a [...] "promising hint at <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> to come" [...] on In My Mind, Claire Simpson stated in her musicOMH review that Stefani's contribution was [...] "purely cosmetic and clearly a transparent means of getting her name on the single to not only boost her own credentials but to help draw Pharrell {{to the attention of}} her increasingly mainstream following." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the final}} episode for actor Iwan Rheon, who had played Ramsay Bolton since Game of Thrones third season. His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> he going to do after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E

500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
500|$|While departing Hoth, Luke meets Flash Gordon, {{the title}} {{character}} to the 1954 television series that inspired Lucas to create Star Wars. When Luke reaches the Dagobah system, he crash lands into a swamp, prompting Allstate spokesperson and actor Dennis Haysbert to appear, in a parody of his commercials. Haysbert was reportedly approached to voice himself, but rejected the offer for unspecified reasons. Later {{getting out of the}} crashed ship, R2-D2 is eaten and spat back out by a swamp monster, prompting R2 to question <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> located beneath the swamp water. The Legion of Doom lair then rises from the swamp, which angers Luke. After Luke meets him, Yoda, as portrayed by Carl, reveals that the secret to mastering the Force is to [...] "check out sweet-ass DVD releases", and goes on to reference several films, including National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Iron Man, as well as Iron Mans director Jon Favreau. [...] A montage depicts Luke performing various athletic feats under Yoda's guidance, interlaced with clips of Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago from the 1985 film Rocky IV. Going on to test Luke's knowledge of various films, Yoda begins to ask the best and worst [...] "naked chick" [...] scenes, with Luke responding by citing the best as Rebecca De Mornay in Risky Business, and the worst as Kathy Bates in About Schmidt. Yoda then asks about the best scene in the 1985 film Teen Wolf and Luke picks the scene in which Michael J. Fox in wolf make-up opens the bathroom door to see his father is also a werewolf. Yoda says Luke is correct, but that he also would have accepted the end celebration in which an extra allegedly exposes himself.|$|E

2500|$|These {{calls to}} extend {{the scope of the}} inquiry to include missing and murdered {{aboriginal}} people of all genders have met with resistance and been criticized as detracting from the current focus on the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women.

Let’s fix that problem first and then we can begin to see <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005, after Vice President Dick Cheney had lobbied {{against a}} {{provision}} to a defence Bill that Republican Senator John McCain had {{passed in the}} senate banning [...] "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment" [...] of all U.S. detainees, Turner {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I am embarrassed that the USA has a vice president for torture. I think it is just reprehensible. He [...] advocates torture, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> it? I just don't understand how a man in that position can take such a stance." [...] Cheney countered the bill went well beyond banning torture and could be interpreted by courts to ban most forms of interrogation.|$|E

[...] Moore also stated that she herself had little influence on Rapunzel: [...] "The character was developed way before I {{had anything to do with}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1914 Chaim Weizmann, later {{president}} of the World Zionist Congress and the first {{president of}} the state of Israel said: [...] "In its initial stage Zionism was conceived by its pioneers as a movement wholly depending on mechanical factors: there is a country which happens to be called Palestine, a country without a people, and, on the other hand, there exists the Jewish people, and it has no country. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> necessary, then, than to fit the gem into the ring, to unite this people with this country? The owners of the country [...] must, therefore, be persuaded and convinced that this marriage is advantageous, not only for the [...] people and for the country, but also for themselves".|$|E
2500|$|After the albums release, several {{publications}} {{deemed the}} {{commercial value of}} the album as a flop. In retrospect, Minogue commented; [...] "Maybe it didn’t do as well because it wasn’t good enough or it didn’t deserve more, who knows?". She further exclaimed, [...] "Even in retrospect it’s hard to say why something works or it doesn’t. It’s dependent on <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> out there, the way it’s promoted...

[...] In June 2015, publications reported Minogue's departure from Parlophone due to the performance of Kiss Me Once, which she first denied. However, she later confirmed she had parted with the label in December 2015 and would stay permanently with Warner Music Australia; she did announced her album Kylie Christmas that same month, and would be her final overall release with Parlophone.|$|E
