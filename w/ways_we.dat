25|$|Of course, we have {{returned}} to realism, to a deeper, more refined and more psychological realism. Let us get a little stronger in it and we shall once more continue on our quest. That {{is why we have}} invited Gordon Craig. After wandering about in search of new <b>ways,</b> <b>we</b> shall again return to realism for more strength. I do not doubt that every abstraction on the stage, such as impressionism, for instance, could be attained by way of a more refined and deeper realism. All other ways are false and dead.|$|E
25|$|Composition of isometries mixes kinds in {{assorted}} <b>ways.</b> <b>We</b> {{can think}} of the identity as either two mirrors or none; either way, it has no effect in composition. And two reflections give either a translation or a rotation, or the identity (which is both, in a trivial way). Reflection composed with either of these could cancel down to a single reflection; otherwise it gives the only available three-mirror isometry, a glide reflection. A pair of translations always reduces to a single translation; so the challenging cases involve rotations. We know a rotation composed with either a rotation or a translation must produce an even isometry. Composition with translation produces another rotation (by the same amount, with shifted fixed point), but composition with rotation can yield either translation or rotation. It is often said that composition of two rotations produces a rotation, and Euler proved a theorem to that effect in 3D; however, this is only true for rotations sharing a fixed point.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} seen both Caliban and Sycorax as {{instances}} of indeterminate {{racial or ethnic}} identity. Leah Marcus argues that the phrase [...] "...blue-eyed hag", suggests racial uncertainty because [...] "as a blue-eyed Algerian Sycorax would have failed to fit our racial stereotypes {{in a number of}} interesting <b>ways.</b> <b>We</b> tend not to think of Africans as blue eyed, even though North Africans of 'Argier' and elsewhere sometimes are." [...] Most critics have interpreted the phrase [...] "blue eyed" [...] to be a reference to blueish rings around the eyes, indicating tiredness or pregnancy, on the grounds that this was the most common meaning of the term at the time. However both Marcus and Diane Purkiss suggest that a reference to race might be implied, suggesting that Sycorax's ethnicity cannot be clearly defined, as although she was born in Algiers, her parentage is not known.|$|E

[...] Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra Juhasz puts forth the film as [...] "an effective critique of the silly sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science [...] fights melodrama and tabloid journalism -- with melodrama and tabloid journalism."

500|$|The Sunderland Echo was {{launched}} {{with an initial}} investment of £3,500, raised by donations of £500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were Quaker banker Edward Backhouse, shipbroker and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, shipbuilder and MP Sir Charles Palmer, newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Lack of experience—only Ruddock had previous knowledge of newspaper management—and over-optimistic estimates of costs meant that the initial funds were quickly exhausted. Storey later admitted: [...] "In our childlike, simple <b>ways,</b> <b>we</b> thought this might be sufficient, but {{in a few months}} all the money was gone, so we paid in another £3,500 and that soon went too." [...] As the prospect of any great financial success receded, Ruddock, Gourley and Palmer withdrew from the project. Storey, however, remained dedicated to the idea, and took on their shares. A further £7,000 in investment from Storey enabled the remaining partners to abandon the [...] "wheezing flat-bed press" [...] and, in July 1876, the Echo moved to new premises at 14Bridge Street, Sunderland.|$|E

Millar said, [...] "Fox are thinking, 'We're sitting on some really awesome things here. There is another side of the Marvel Universe. Let's try and get some cohesiveness going.' So they brought me in to oversee that really. To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> could take this stuff and new properties that could spin out of it." [...] , released in 2014, was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe, ahead of the release of a Fantastic Four reboot film the next year. However, in May 2014, Days of Future Past and Fantastic Four screenwriter Simon Kinberg stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the X-Men films, explaining that [...] "none of the X-Men movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team—the Fantastic Four. And the Fantastic Four acquire powers, so for them {{to live in a world}} where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated, because you're like, 'Oh, you're just a mutant.' Like, 'What's so fantastic about you?' ... they live in discrete universes."

500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008.

In Logopolis the Doctor said of the Master, [...] "He's a Time Lord. In many <b>ways,</b> <b>we</b> have the same mind."
