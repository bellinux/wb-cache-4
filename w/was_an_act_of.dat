5|$|In July 1840, a {{delegation}} headed by Adolphe Crémieux and Sir Moses Montefiore left for Egypt {{to save the}} Jews of Damascus. Crémieux and Montefiore requested Muhammad Ali to transfer the investigation to Alexandria or have the case considered by European judges. However, their request was denied. The delegation, concerned primarily {{with the release of}} the imprisoned Jews of Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave {{about a month}} earlier, he stated {{he had been a}} pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced {{there was no reason to}} suspect that the crash <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> terrorism.|$|E

5|$|Texian {{survivors}} of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea would, at worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 Tornel Decree that stated the insurrection <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed {{with the need to}} do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was shot through the face and his gold watch stolen. The dead were cremated on a pyre.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 (c. 34) <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that was}} given Royal Assent on 11 November 1999. The Act {{reformed}} the House of Lords, one of the chambers of Parliament. For centuries, the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats; the Act removed such a right. However, {{as part of a}} compromise, the Act did permit ninety-two hereditary peers to remain in the House on an interim basis. Another ten were created life peers to enable them to remain in the House.|$|E
5|$|The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{reformed}} {{the auxiliary}} {{forces of the}} British Army by transferring existing Volunteer and Yeomanry units into a new Territorial Force (TF); and disbanding the Militia {{to form a new}} Special Reserve of the Regular Army. This reorganisation formed {{a major part of the}} Haldane Reforms, named after the creator of the Act, Richard Haldane.|$|E

5|$|When one of Isaac's assailants {{is found}} strangled {{with the dead}} man's {{fingerprints}} on his body, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to investigate. Scully suggests that the murder <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> retribution, and argues that the evidence was staged to look like revenge from beyond the grave. When the agents visit Ariel and Jacob, their request for the exhumation of Isaac's body angers the old man.|$|E
5|$|While the {{persecution}} under Constantius was relatively light, {{there is no}} doubt about the force of {{the persecution}} in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E
5|$|Ex-Confederates {{were usually}} a safe voting bloc for the Democrats, {{but many of}} them deserted Goebel because he had, in 1895, {{approached}} and quickly killed his main local political opponent, the grandson of Revolutionary War General and US Congressman Thomas Sandford, the esteemed banker and former Confederate colonel John Sandford, in what he declared <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> self-defense. On the other hand, blacks had historically been a safe bloc for the Republicans, but Taylor had alienated many of them by not strongly opposing the Separate Coach Bill, which would have racially segregated railroad facilities. Goebel also risked losing support to minor party candidates. Besides John Y. Brown, the dissenting Democrats' nominee, the Populist Party nominated a candidate, drawing votes from Goebel's populist base. To unite his traditional base, Goebel convinced William Jennings Bryan, a hero to most populists and Democrats, to campaign for him. As soon as Bryan finished his tour of the state, Governor Bradley reversed course and began speaking in favor of Taylor. While Bradley insisted that his motives were to defend his administration, journalist Henry Watterson believed Taylor had promised to support Bradley's senatorial bid if elected.|$|E

5|$|If {{the latter}} {{suggestion}} is correct, then Thored's {{first appearance in}} history is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recension D (EF)'s entry for 966, which recorded the accession of Oslac to the ealdormanry of southern Northumbria: In this year, Thored, Gunnar's son, harried Westmoringa land, and, in this same year, Oslac succeeded {{to the office of}} ealdorman. The Anglo-Saxon scholar Frank Stenton believed that this <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> regional faction-fighting, rather than, as had been suggested by others, Thored carrying out the orders of King Edgar the Peaceable. This entry is, incidentally, the first mention of Westmoringa land, that is, Westmorland. Gunnar seems to have been ealdorman earlier in the decade, for in one charter (surviving only in a later cartulary) dated to 963 and three Abingdon charters dated to 965, an ealdorman (dux) called Gunnar is mentioned.|$|E
5|$|In Tallahassee, Florida, on December 21, 1999, a {{memorial}} service is held for a former FBI agent named Raymond Crouch. His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), {{who claims to have}} worked with her husband. After the other mourners have left, Johnson returns to the funeral parlor, dons the corpse's clothes, and places a cell phone in the coffin. One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave with a shovel. Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to the interior of the casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. Because of the presence of goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E
5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E
