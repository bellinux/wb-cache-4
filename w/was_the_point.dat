5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E
5|$|Martin's first {{event of}} the 2011–12 World Curling Tour <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point</b> Optical Curling Classic, where he {{finished}} as a runner-up to Mike McEwen. He then won his first {{event of the}} season, the Westcoast Curling Classic, against McEwen. He next participated in the Cactus Pheasant Classic as the defending champion, but lost to Randy Ferbey in the semifinals. At the World Cup of Curling, Martin finished the round robin with a 4–1 win-loss record, but missed {{a chance to win}} another Grand Slam title after he was edged past by John Epping, 3–4. He failed to make it into the playoffs at his next event, the Sun Life Classic. He and his team then competed in the Canada Cup of Curling, securing close wins over Glenn Howard and Jeff Stoughton in the round robin and finishing the round robin undefeated. He then played Howard in the final, and managed to defeat him with a score of 7–4, winning his record 4th Canada Cup title as skip. He and his team also earned berths into the 2012 Canada Cup, Continental Cup, and, most importantly, the 2013 Olympic Trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner {{with a chance to}} mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E

25|$|Costa Rica <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> {{where the}} Mesoamerican and South American native {{cultures}} met.

25|$|Drawbridge, as {{its name}} suggests, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at which land traffic crossed the Broadkill River, about halfway from Milton to the Delaware Bay.

25|$|Also, {{due to a}} {{micro-climate}} in {{the area}} of Alagoa, the parish enjoyed a period of fruit cultivation (something rare {{to the rest of the}} island), where oblong apples (similar to pears in shape) were grown.

However, the damage could finally be assessed after Philippine Air Force staff arrived in Guiuan on November 10.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the state}} became {{a focus for}} war industries.

25|$|James L. Richardson {{identified}} five central {{themes in}} Locke's writing: individualism, consent, {{the concepts of}} the rule of law and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration.

The individual, rather than the community or institutions, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.|$|E

25|$|Human {{beings have}} often sought to give {{concrete}} form to our powerful collective longing for peace. After World War I, that longing {{led to the}} League of Nations and numerous rules and taboos designed to govern warfare itself. Of these, the most important was the proscription against attacking and killing civilian non-combatants even in times of war. However, {{the second half of}} the twentieth century has seen most of those taboos broken. Guernica <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of departure, and Hiroshima is the ultimate symbol.

25|$|The main Temple of Mars (Aedes Martis) in the Republican period also lay {{outside the}} sacred {{boundary}} and {{was devoted to}} the god's warrior aspect. It was built to fulfill a vow (votum) made by a Titus Quinctius in 388 BC during the Gallic siege of Rome. The founding day (dies natalis) was commemorated on June 1, and the temple is attested by several inscriptions and literary sources. The sculpture group of Mars and the wolves was displayed there. Soldiers sometimes assembled at the temple before heading off to war, and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of departure for a major parade of Roman cavalry held annually on July 15.|$|E
25|$|Gleizes' Proto-Cubist work {{entitled}} L'Arbre (The Tree) {{exhibited at}} the 1910 Salon des Indépendants in Paris <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of departure for Paysage à Meudon. Visibly distant {{from the work of}} Picasso or Braque, Paysage à Meudon is stylistically much closer to Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Léger and Delaunay. Gleizes' interpretation of space in a succession of plans and simple geometric lines descends directly from the teachings of Paul Cézanne. These same aesthetic preoccupations would unite several artists that formed a group and held meetings in Puteaux, at the Duchamp residence. For their first public manifestation as a group—the Salon de la Section d'Or of 1912—Gleizes chose to present this 1911 landscape (no. 39 of the catalogue), along with Les Baigneuses and the monumental Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing) both of 1912.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Governor Treen {{appointed}} Colten as {{the assistant}} secretary to Paul J.

Hardy was a former Louisiana Secretary of State who had been an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in 1979. When Hardy left the top transportation post, Treen elevated Colten to secretary of the department. He served a second stint as assistant secretary of DOTD under Governor Buddy Roemer, with Neil L.

25|$|The theory {{still holds}} great sway with commentators. The former {{communist}} government in Yugoslavia {{had a history}} of assassinations directed against its opponents. The victims were mostly Croatian émigrés, although others were targeted. The attacks were usually carried out by small teams consisting of a trigger-man supported by a spotter and were always carefully planned. The attacks were often made as targets entered or left their homes, since this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at which they were most vulnerable and where a case of mistaken identity was least likely. An opposition journalist was assassinated outside his home in Belgrade just a few days before Dando's murder and the method used in both cases was identical. Journalist Bob Woffinden advanced the view that a Yugoslav group was behind the Dando killing and, in various newspaper articles, contested all the grounds on which the police had dismissed this possibility.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} British battlecruisers {{were still}} ahead of Evan-Thomas' 5th BS when first contact {{was made with}} the HSF. Beatty ordered a reversal of course, now attempting to lead the German fleet northwards towards the British Grand Fleet. At this point a second signalling error occurred with flag signals sent to the 5th BS ordering it also to turn about. A signal was raised by Lion and seen by Barham as it steamed past the now retreating Lion in the opposite direction. However, the signal was not lowered (which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at which {{it was supposed to}} be carried out) until the battleships were dangerously close to the German fleet and under heavy fire, and then the order was to 'turn in succession'. This means each ship turns as it reaches exactly the same spot in the ocean, and in this situation marked out a perfect target area upon which the German fleet could aim as each British ship passed through it in turn. The last ship, Malaya, seeing the firefight ahead turned early.|$|E
