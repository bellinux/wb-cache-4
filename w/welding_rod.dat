5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and <b>welding</b> <b>rod</b> coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
25|$|The flame {{is applied}} to the base metal and held until a small puddle of molten metal is formed. The puddle is moved along the path where the weld bead is desired. Usually, more metal is added to the puddle as it is moved along by dipping metal from a <b>welding</b> <b>rod</b> or filler rod into the molten metal puddle. The metal puddle will travel towards where the metal is the hottest. This is {{accomplished}} through torch manipulation by the welder.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 41) 6061 aluminum is a precipitation hardenable alloy that is {{used extensively}} in structural applications. Large ring shaped parts fabricated from 6061 are often rolled from annealed flat stock. A welding operation is required to join {{the ends of the}} part after shaping. The part is then precipitation hardened to bring the 6061 alloy up to the T 6 condition. Unfortunately, the weld metals commonly used to join 6061 do not achieve the same hardness as the parent metal in the T 6 condition. In this study the effects of <b>weld</b> <b>rod</b> type, <b>welding</b> procedure, and postweld heat treatments were examined. Four different <b>weld</b> <b>rods</b> were used to join 6061 samples. The welding was done with and without a water chi lied fixture attached to the specimens being welded. Welded specimens were aged using ten different heat treatment cycles that included 9900 F or 9700 F solution treatments and natural or artificial aging at 3200 F or 3500 F. The 6061 parent material relies on a Magnesium Silicide precipitate for hardening effects. Three of the <b>weld</b> <b>rods</b> used, (X 4643, 5356, & 5556), have similar AI-Mg-Si alloy constituents. The fourth rod, 4043, is a AI-Si alloy. The X 4643 <b>weld</b> <b>rod</b> was the only weld alloy to match the T 6 condition of the 6061 parent metal after aging. This occurred only in the water chilled case where the chill minimizes melting of the parent material during the welding process and increases the solidification rate of the weld metal. The appearant effect of the chill is to promote a finer dendritic structure...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of plastic <b>welding</b> <b>rod</b> design and manufacture is the porosity of the material.
