5|$|Grossman {{was born}} in Bloomington, Indiana in 1980, the son of Rex Daniel Grossman II and Maureen Grossman. Under the {{motivation}} and guidance of his father, he began playing football {{at an early age}} in grade school. He originally started his football career as a running back. Despite his success running the ball, his mother asked his coach (his father) to convert him to a quarterback <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth grade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very {{concerned}} about the financial security of his family. <b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{never left}} the United States during the war, but he kept a film reel that he {{obtained}} <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service. The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts would someday arise {{as to whether the}} Holocaust had occurred. It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz, though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.|$|E

50|$|Shirakian {{was given}} the task to assassinate Sait Halim Pasha <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> exile in Rome, Italy. Shirakian took up {{residence}} in a house on 28 Via Cola di Rienzo in Rome. On December 5, 1921, Shirakian assassinated Sait Halim Pasha <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a taxi on the home on Via Eustacchio street.|$|R

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Army, he {{received}} a package from Paul Brown, the Ohio State football coach. It contained footballs and a contract for him to sign to play on a team Brown was coaching in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He signed the contract in May 1945 and agreed to join the team, called the Cleveland Browns, {{after the war ended}} in 1946. Groza got $500 a month stipend {{until the end of the}} war and a $7,500 annual salary.|$|E
5|$|After winning all the breaststroke {{events at}} the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole. Carlile was {{regarded}} as the leading swimming coach in Australia at the time. At age 13, O'Brien was already a large teenager, weighing in at 82.6kg. He only trained with Gathercole during holidays, when his father could take him to Sydney; Jim Wilkins, a Catholic priest in Bathurst, supervised him according to Gathercole's program <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> countryside. Within a year, O'Brien rose from being a country carnival champion to a national-level athlete, despite {{the death of his}} father in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended {{for the defense of}} New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E

5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
5|$|Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7/708 {{declared}} against Hampshire {{and then}} made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 484 runs. The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey, which Macartney missed due to injury. In the latter match, Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first ball of the match, and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle. Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in just over two hours of batting. Such was the dominance of Macartney {{and the rest of}} Armstrong's men that they disposed of Northamptonshire in less than two days. However, his most famed innings was yet to come.|$|E
5|$|Opera as a {{dramatic}} genre originated {{around the turn}} from the 16th to the 17th centuries, although the word itself was not in use before 1650. Precursors of musical drama included pastoral plays with songs and choruses, and the madrigal comedies of the late 16th century. Monteverdi had already {{established himself as a}} leading composer of madrigals before writing his first full-length operas in the years 1606–08, <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. These works, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, deal respectively with the Greek myths of Orpheus and Ariadne. After a disagreement in 1612 with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice to take up the position of director of music at St Mark's Basilica, where he remained until his death in 1643.|$|E

5|$|According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in {{the early}} 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This was a {{difficult}} period for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting technical barriers as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced with these issues, Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products, including Luminous Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines.|$|E

25|$|A major {{reference}} source used by Basquiat {{throughout his career}} was the book Gray's Anatomy, which his mother had given him <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital at age seven.
