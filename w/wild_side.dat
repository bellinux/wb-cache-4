She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with Tall Story, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. Period of Adjustment and Walk on the <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> followed in 1962. In Walk on the <b>Wild</b> <b>Side,</b> Fonda played a prostitute and earned a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E

McMahon has said he became interested in studying town planning as a possible future way of correcting the all too obvious mistakes he found in the running of Blacktown. He wrote a treatise on the subject but became disillusioned when he realised the many political and vested interests trying to prevent the ideal becoming a reality.|$|E

It is the protected sanctuary where a wide spectrum of animal and plant species flourishes. They include crocodiles, chimpanzees, gorillas, various monkeys, leopards, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes. It is also a great place to observe different species of birds.|$|E
25|$|After the split, Dudley, Jeczalik, and Langan {{moved to}} the UK-based China Records label, taking the Art of Noise name with them. Some of the band's {{original}} imagery and ethos was retained for their second album, In Visible Silence. This album spawned the Grammy Award-winning cover of the Peter Gunn theme, recorded with Duane Eddy, who had a hit with Peter Gunn in 1959. The Art of Noise collaboration reached number two on the Billboard dance charts. The Peter Gunn video featured comedian Rik Mayall in a parody of the private eye film genre.

25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual phrase that tells you what the picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk on the <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Elaine Makatura came to {{work with}} Bass in his Los Angeles office. By 1960, with the opening to Spartacus, she was {{directing}} and producing title sequences, and in 1961 the two married, beginning more than 40 years of close collaboration. After {{the birth of their}} children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, they concentrated on their family, film directing, and title sequences. Saul and Elaine designed title sequences for more than 40 years, continuously experimenting with a variety of innovative techniques and effects, from Bunraku-style maneuvers in Spartacus (1960), live-action sequences in Walk On The <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> (1962), to time-lapse photography in The Age of Innocence (1993), and even chopped liver in Mr. Saturday Night (1992). Their live-action opening title sequences often served as prologues to their films and transitioned seamlessly into their opening scenes. These “time before” title sequences either compress or expand time with startling results. The title sequence to Grand Prix (1966) portrays the moments before the opening race in Monte Carlo, the title sequence to The Big Country (1958) depicts the days it takes a stage coach to travel to a remote Western town, and the opening montage title sequence to The Victors (1963) chronicles the twenty-seven years between World War I and the middle of World War II, where the film begins.|$|E

However, for Nicole it wasn't about sexuality, rather finding herself the center of attention. James described their dynamic, stating: [...] "Freya's exactly what Nicole was like when she first arrived in the bay, {{that is why they}} click. Nicole relates to the <b>wild</b> <b>side</b> of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. James said Nicole was [...] "angry" [...] because she was on Freya's [...] "not hot list". Freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just [...] "happy to be center of attention" [...] and happy that people were talking about her again. The incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however James said Geoff was the reason she became bored.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the Tupelo Honey {{recording}} sessions, Morrison {{had recorded}} demo tracks in Woodstock {{for an upcoming}} country-and-western album. Some of the tracks planned for Tupelo Honey did appear on the album, [...] but other more traditional country songs like [...] "The <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> of Life", [...] "Crying Time" [...] and [...] "Banks of the Ohio" [...] were abandoned. Morrison decided to move from Woodstock when the lease on his house expired and the landlord wanted to move back in. He explained to Richard Williams in Melody Maker that {{the release of the}} documentary film, Woodstock, in 1970 had altered the quaint character of the [...] community: [...] "Everybody and his uncle started showing up at the bus station, and that was the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be." [...] In April 1971, before he began recording on the planned album, [...] Morrison and his family moved to Marin County, California, where his wife Janet Planet had family living close by. Morrison's guitarist at the time, John Platania, told biographer Steve Turner that Morrison [...] "didn't want to leave, but Janet wanted to move out West. He was manipulated into going." [...] The Morrisons' new home was in a rural setting situated on a hillside close to San Francisco amid redwood trees. With the move, Morrison abandoned the idea of a full country album and exchanged some of the intended material for songs he had written earlier.|$|E
