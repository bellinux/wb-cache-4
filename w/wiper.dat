5|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 29 December, the naked body {{of a young woman}} was found dumped at a lay-by on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a {{motorist}} who had stopped to change a windscreen <b>wiper.</b> Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E
25|$|The {{windshield}} <b>wiper</b> is a bladed device used to wipe {{rain and}} dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson {{is credited with}} inventing the first operational windshield <b>wiper.</b> In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windshield wipers closely resembles the windshield <b>wiper</b> found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.|$|E
5000|$|Some larger {{cars are}} {{equipped}} with hidden <b>wipers</b> (or depressed-park <b>wipers).</b> When <b>wipers</b> are switched off in standard non-hidden designs, a [...] "parking" [...] mechanism or circuit moves the <b>wipers</b> to the lower extreme of the wiped area {{near the bottom of}} the windscreen, but still in sight. For designs that hide the <b>wipers,</b> the windscreen extends below the rear edge of the hood, and the <b>wipers</b> park themselves below the wiping range at the bottom of the windscreen, but out of sight.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wipers</b> is a self-titled live album by {{punk rock}} band <b>Wipers,</b> {{recorded}} between February and March 1984 and released in 1985 by Enigma Records. It {{had previously been}} issued by the band's own Trap Records as a cassette-only release titled <b>Wipers</b> Tour 84. It was later reissued as <b>Wipers</b> by Restless and band leader Greg Sage's Zeno Records.|$|R
50|$|Windshield <b>Wipers,</b> Interval: Through Special Order, F-Series pickup buyers {{can take}} {{advantage}} of the convenience of interval windshield <b>wipers</b> without having to order the complete Convenience Group. By Allowing the driver to select an interval from approximately one to 12 seconds for intermittent sweeps of the <b>wipers,</b> interval <b>wipers</b> can be the ideal feature for driving in a light rain or road spray.|$|R
25|$|The low {{belt line}} and window design afforded the driver with {{outstanding}} visibility. The Pacer had {{laminated safety glass}} in the windshield. The articulated front wipers were hidden when in their parked position, and a rear <b>wiper</b> and washer was optional.|$|E
25|$|Striped bass {{have also}} been hybridized with white bass to produce hybrid striped bass also known as <b>wiper,</b> whiterock bass, {{sunshine}} bass, palmetto bass, and Cherokee bass. These hybrids have been stocked in many freshwater areas across the US.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Acura added a {{standard}} power moonroof to all TL models. Additionally, all Acura TLs received a variable-speed intermittent <b>wiper</b> setting. The 3.2 TL had 205/65/15 tires and a V6 motor. The sport-targeted, 5-cylinder 2.5 TL was further fitted with new alloy wheels.|$|E

25|$|Recall code RJ-1122-2: For {{the same}} dates and models in recall above, the bracket {{securing}} the glovebox had insufficient space to a wiring loom, possibly causing interference to the wiring due to long-term vibration. Symptoms being a blown fuse, starting failure and/or failing screen <b>wiper</b> operation.|$|E
25|$|If {{the items}} in {{question}} are repaired, replaced or removed from the vehicle, {{the right of the}} owner to appeal becomes null and void. Failure because of items easily replaceable, such as tyres or windscreen <b>wiper</b> blades, may not be appealed against, as it cannot be adequately determined if they were the ones fitted at the time of inspection.|$|E
25|$|In the exterior, Honda updates {{the front}} with larger air intakes {{on the lower}} front fascia, {{installs}} new head- and taillights, and has new wheel designs. The new grille comes with a blue stripe that Honda says represents the car’s “high-tech hybrid identity.” A thinner rear spoiler and a more compactly mounted rear <b>wiper</b> motor help to improve visibility through the rear window.|$|E
50|$|Slightly more {{complicated}} was the two axis stepping switch, (also called Strowger switch or two motion selector in Britain). Typically, a single compact group of <b>wipers</b> could connect {{to one of}} 100 (or 200) different fixed contacts, in ten levels. When the switch was idle, the <b>wipers</b> were disengaged from the fixed contacts. The <b>wipers</b> moved {{up and down on}} a vertical shaft, and rotated into the contact bank to make a connection. A spring, internal to the vertical shaft, returned the <b>wipers</b> to their home position at the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with other}} <b>Wipers</b> records, Youth of America has since {{come to be}} {{acknowledged}} as an important album {{in the development of}} American underground and independent rock movements of the early 1980s.

50|$|Eight Songs for Greg Sage and the <b>Wipers</b> is a <b>Wipers</b> tribute album {{released}} on Tim/Kerr Records in 1992. The album was first released as a box set of 4 colored 7-inch records.|$|R
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is to equip the vehicle with a single <b>wiper</b> placed in {{the centre of the}} windshield, allowing it to cover both sides of the windshield. This mitigates the amount of drag by decreasing the frontal area of the blade. While such application may be useful for racing, for most road vehicles this would produce minimal improvement in overall drag reduction.|$|E
25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the side window frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The windshield <b>wiper,</b> manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as the release of the R33 GT-R and GT-R V·Spec, Nissan {{released}} the R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 model. Changes made in the R33 N1 are similar to those in the R32 N1. The car was made lighter by removing the ABS, air conditioning, sound system, rear <b>wiper,</b> and boot carpet. The R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 received the slightly revised R33 N1 engine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wipers</b> gained {{significant}} exposure {{as a result}} of Nirvana's 1992 covers of two songs from Is This Real? ("D-7" [...] on the EP Hormoaning, and [...] "Return of the Rat" [...] on the Eight Songs compilation), and Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's mention of <b>Wipers</b> as a major influence. The <b>Wipers</b> were influential for the grunge music scene in general, also being cited by the Melvins, Mudhoney and Dinosaur Jr..|$|R
25|$|To {{minimize}} {{production costs}} for export, the windshield <b>wipers</b> used a pattern where the <b>wipers</b> {{started in the}} center and wiped towards the edge of the windshield, instead of from the passenger side towards the driver.|$|R

25|$|The C5 {{was also}} the first Corvette to {{incorporate}} a drive-by-wire throttle; and variable-effort steering, whereby the assist level of the power steering is varied according to vehicle speed (more at lower speeds, less at higher speeds). Also notable, though rarely discussed, the C5 generation was the first model to adopt the parallel or 'tandem' windshield <b>wiper</b> configuration, abandoning the opposed configuration that was used on every previous Corvette model since the first in 1953.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield <b>wiper</b> on the passenger side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E
25|$|The eyelids {{of a bird}} are {{not used}} in blinking. Instead the eye is {{lubricated}} by the nictitating membrane, a third concealed eyelid that sweeps horizontally across the eye like a windscreen <b>wiper.</b> The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds when they are under water. When sleeping, the lower eyelid rises to cover the eye in most birds, {{with the exception of}} the horned owls where the upper eyelid is mobile.|$|E
