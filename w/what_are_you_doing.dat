500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I know where I am at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Trying {{to unravel}} {{the mystery of the}} song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is {{concerned}} with internal questions, rather than external ones: [...] "Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent—isn't it obvious that whoever wrote [...] "Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?" [...] already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> here?" [...] Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of [...] "People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step." [...] For Marcus, [...] "'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ali's example {{inspired}} countless black Americans and others. The New York Times columnist William Rhoden wrote, [...] "Ali's actions {{changed my}} standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot {{or the ability}} to stop on a dime was no longer enough. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> for the liberation of your people? <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?" ...|$|R

500|$|The episode {{produced}} varying {{responses from}} television commentators. [...] "Lisa Goes Gaga" [...] provoked The A.V. Club journalist Rowan Kaiser {{to conclude that}} the installment [...] "wasn't that painful to watch"—albeit found the concept and general execution to be irritating. In his B– review, Kaiser asserted that [...] "Lisa Goes Gaga" [...] used a straightforward interpretation of the singer, and felt that Lady Gaga's appearance was superior to previous guest appearances. [...] "So many Simpsons celebrity voices," [...] he stated, [...] "show up for a few minutes at most, with Extras-style 'Wow, Chris Martin of Coldplay, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> here?' Or they voice one-off characters without enough flair to be memorable. Instead, Gaga was the focus of the entire episode, to the point where if you wanted to call it a half-hour commercial for Lady Gaga, you probably wouldn’t be wrong. Fortunately for 'Lisa Goes Gaga', the celebrity at its heart is entertaining enough that it being her commercial isn’t a complete waste of time." [...] A writer for HLN avouched that The Simpsons managed to culminate its season [...] "with a lot of style"; David Greenwald of Billboard echoed similar sentiments. Gaga's performance was frequently mentioned in the critiques. Idolator's Becky Bain, Tracy Gilchrist of SheWired, and Caroline Westbrook of Metro issued favorable assessments of her acting: the latter affirmed that Gaga had many memorable moments throughout the episode.|$|E
500|$|There {{were only}} 16 presidential primary states in 1920, {{of which the}} most crucial to Harding was Ohio. Harding had to have some loyalists at the {{convention}} to have any chance of nomination, and the Wood campaign hoped to knock Harding {{out of the race}} by taking Ohio. Wood campaigned in the state, and his supporter, Procter, spent large sums; Harding spoke in the nonconfrontational style he had adopted in 1914. Harding and Daugherty were so confident of sweeping Ohio's 48 delegates that the candidate went on to the next state, Indiana, before the April 27 Ohio primary. Harding carried Ohio by only 15,000 votes over Wood, taking less than half the total vote, and won only 39 of 48 delegates. In Indiana, Harding finished fourth, with less than ten percent of the vote, and failed to win a single delegate. He was willing to give up and have Daugherty file his nomination papers for the Senate, but Florence Harding grabbed the phone from his hand, [...] "Warren Harding, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> Give up? Not until the convention is over. Think of your friends in Ohio!" [...] On learning that Daugherty had left the phone line, the future First Lady retorted, [...] "Well, you tell Harry Daugherty for me that we're in this fight until Hell freezes over." ...|$|E
500|$|Walden {{demanded that}} whoever was {{responsible}} be terminated; as a result, Kim Payne, Mike Callahan, and Tuffy Phillips all were fired. [...] "That was a culmination of everything falling apart.... They were {{a symptom of}} the problem—not the problem itself," [...] said Perkins. The band again joined the Grateful Dead and the Band in July at Watkins Glen Speedway in New York's Finger Lakes region, for what was then deemed the largest rock concert ever. 150,000 tickets were sold, but the crowd expanded to nearly 600,000, causing it to be declared a disaster area. People abandoned their cars and walked up to ten miles to attend the concert. The jam between the three bands was later called [...] "garbage" [...] by Trucks, as all involved were under the influence of various substances, including alcohol, cocaine, and LSD. To promote the release of the album, Don Kirshner's Rock Concert program staged an episode set in Macon, taping performances from the Allman Brothers Band and the Marshall Tucker Band. Betts walked offstage midway through the performance, with Walden chasing him down the street and urging him to return. [...] "Walking off the stage was a first for me. It was like, 'Dude, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> We're all brothers here. If there's a problem, let's talk about it,'" [...] said Leavell.|$|E

500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

[...] Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.|$|E
2500|$|An {{incident}} that probably dates to Skarbek's first visit back to Poland in February 1940 illustrates the hazards she faced {{while working in}} her occupied homeland. At a Warsaw café, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: [...] "Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!" [...] When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered {{that she would have}} sworn she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the café.|$|E

When he goes on a date with the coworker and she tells him she will abort the baby, he embraces her.

2500|$|Imprisoned in Rhode Island, it {{took about}} two weeks for Weeks to decide to co-operate with authorities, leading some in South Boston to dub him [...] "Kevin Squeaks" [...] or [...] "Two Weeks".

Remember you can't rat on a rat. Those guys have been giving up everyone for thirty years." [...] He was also unnerved by the prospect of spending {{the rest of his life}} in prison.

C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes." ...|$|E
