50|$|It {{is known}} that Thomas Tinker was an English Separatist {{residing}} in Leiden, Holland in the early 1600s. But {{the only time that}} his name appears in Leiden records is on January 6, 1617, when he became a citizen of that city. His profession was listed as <b>wood</b> <b>sawyer.</b> His guarantors, per the record of that event, were Abraham Gray and John Keble.|$|E
50|$|After them, {{a company}} of <b>wood</b> <b>sawyers</b> moved to Roquedols until 1893 when the castle was bought by Rose Anastasia Vincent, wife Dol, from Marseille. Her son sold the estate to the state in 1938.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, the nativity scene {{featured}} seventeen new {{figures of}} spruce on loan to the Vatican from sculptors and <b>wood</b> <b>sawyers</b> {{of the town}} of Tesero, Italy in the Italian Alps. The figures included peasants, a flutist, a bagpipe player and a shepherd named Titaoca. Twelve nativity scenes created before 1800 from Tesero were put on display in the Vatican audience hall.|$|R
50|$|X-radiographs of a {{painting}} allow conservators to see beneath the work's surface. The use of this method also helps distinguish between materials that look similar under visible light, but have different x-ray absorption. For example, the Victoria and Albert Museum used x-radiography on {{a painting}} by Jean-Francois Millet entitled The <b>Wood</b> <b>Sawyers.</b> The image below showed a woman representing the French Republic, a submission to a competition that Millet would lose. Without the means {{to pay for a}} new canvas, Millet painted over the existing image.|$|R
50|$|X-ray {{analysis}} revealed alterations to the paint of a sixteenth century portrait {{that had been}} identified as a Bronzino portrait of Eleanor of Toledo at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After a conservation treatment, which removed the added paint, the subject of the portrait was found to be Isabella de' Medici. The painting was also attributed to Alessandro Allori.Jean-François Millet’s The <b>Wood</b> <b>Sawyers</b> at Victoria & Albert Museum was x-rayed, revealing that Millet had reused a canvas to complete this oil painting. The artist not only painted over a previous work, but he had also added strips of canvas to enlarge the painting area.|$|R
50|$|Disguised as a janitor, a man detonates a bomb at {{the center}} of the US Capitol building, causing the White House to be on lockdown. Finnerty is sent to escort the Speaker to an {{underground}} command center in the Pentagon, while Vice President of the United States Alvin Hammond (Michael Murphy) is taken aboard Air Force Two. At the same time, mercenaries led by Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke), having infiltrated the White House by disguising themselves as audio-visual repairmen, quickly overwhelm the Secret Service, take the tour group hostage and seize the White House. Cale manages to escape to go find his daughter, who was separated from him during the tour. Retiring Head of the Presidential Detail Martin Walker (James <b>Woods)</b> escorts <b>Sawyer</b> and his detail to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. Once they gain access, Walker kills his detail, revealing himself to be the real leader of the attack on the White House. He wants vengeance against Sawyer after a botched black ops mission resulted in the death of his son. Cale kills a mercenary, takes his gun and radio, and rescues Sawyer.|$|R
50|$|A {{special tool}} {{designed}} specifically for underbucking makes the job of cutting from the ground upwards a lot easier. The underbuck tool is driven into {{the section of the}} log which is considered to be least likely of moving once the cut has been successfully made. The crosscut saw's backside rides along the pulley that rests on the bar driven into the log. As the sawyer draws the saw backward, the sawyer may apply leverage downward and the pulley will redirect the force upward into the <b>wood.</b> Sometimes a <b>sawyer</b> will not want to do underbucking. They will either sometimes just cut from the top down, or they will half underbuck and then just finish by cutting it from the top.|$|R
25|$|Back at the Sawyer home, Verna {{stitches}} {{the remnants}} of the mentally-scarred Jedidiah Sawyer's face and applies a muzzle to hold them together. She then leads him into a room where his siblings are holding Elizabeth and Hartman captive. She gifts Jedidiah with his original chainsaw and Elizabeth watches on in horror as he bisects Hartman to death. As the family celebrates, Elizabeth flees into the <b>woods</b> while the <b>Sawyers</b> give chase. She nearly escapes, only to be caught in a bear trap. Elizabeth attempts to appeal to Jedidiah's sympathy, while Verna encourages him to kill her to protect their family. Jedidiah begins to listen to Elizabeth's pleas that he is not a killer, unable to recall events prior to his injury, until she insults Verna. This causes him to decapitate her in retaliation.|$|R
5000|$|The American rivers {{were still}} {{difficult}} to navigate, however, {{because of the}} presence of dead <b>wood</b> called snags, <b>sawyers,</b> or log jams.Shreve was appointed Superintendent of Western River Improvements in 1826 and charged with finding a solution to this problem. He had been working on a design for a [...] "snagboat" [...] since 1821, and he finally had it built in 1837. This craft, the Heliopolis, had a steam-powered windlass used to pull large concentrations of dead wood from the water. As a result of the success of his design, Shreve was ordered in 1832 by Secretary of War Lewis Cass to clear the Great Raft, 150 miles of dead wood on the Red River. Shreve successfully removed the Raft (despite inadequate funding) by 1839. The area of the Red River where the Raft was most concentrated is today his namesake city of Shreveport. Shreve helped to establish Shreveport via the Shreve Town Company.|$|R
