40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the discontinuous ventilation cycle (DVC) observed in many insects, including all ants described to date, is an adaptation to reduce respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to measure respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> as a percentage of total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> and to estimate what sustained rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> would be in the absence of spiracular control. We used two independent techniques to measure real-time <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in female alates of Pogonomyrmex rugosus. The first measured water vapor emission and CO 2 production simultaneously using dual-wavelength infrared absorbance analysis (DWIRAA). The second measured <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> gravimetrically. Real-time measurement allowed the separation of cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates (interburst) from <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates during the ventilation phase (burst) of the DVC. Cuticular permeability of P. rugosusfemale alates was only 27 ngh 21 cm 22 Pa 21, one-third of that reported for workers of the same species and the lowest yet reported for ants. Partly because of this low cuticular permeability, respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> represented a greater percentage of overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (13 %) than has generally been reported for other insects. The DWIRAA and gravimetric techniques gave equivalent results. Peak rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> during the burst phase were 2. 8 -fold higher than cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates alone (7. 68 mgg 21 h 21 versus 2. 77 mg 21 h 21 at 25 ˚C). This is a conservative estimate of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in the absence of spiracular control. Contrary to findings in certain other insects that suggest a negligible role for respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> we find that, in an insect that employs the DVC and has low cuticular permeability, overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates rise several-fold in the absence of direct spiracular control. Our findings lend strong support to the water conservation hypothesis for the role of the DVC. In at least some insects, respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates can reach magnitudes significant enough, relative to other routes of <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> for strong selective pressure to act on them...|$|R

However, studies using TDPs and load cells (gravimetric <b>water</b> <b>loss)</b> to estimate <b>water</b> use of landscape tree species are rare. This research compared gravimetric <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (extimated with load cells) of four containerized landscape tree species with <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> estimated with TDPs. Over a 66 day period, an experiment compared <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> of three established, 5. 0 cm (2 in) caliper poplar (Populus nigra 2 ̆ 7 Italica 2 ̆ 7) trees in 75 -liter (20 gal) containers on load cells to TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> Each tree had a single 30 mm (1. 2 inch) TDP inserted into the trunk at four heights above soil level (15, 30, 45, and 60 cm (6, 12, 18, and 24 in, respectively)). Data revealed TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> was less than load cell estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> regardless of TDP height, but TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> at the 30 cm height was closes to actual load cell estimated tree <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> Over the next three years, similar sized Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana 2 ̆ 7 Bradford 2 ̆ 7), English oak (Quercus robur x Q. bicolor 2 ̆ 7 Asjes 2 ̆ 7), poplar (Populus deltoides 2 ̆ 7 Siouxland 2 ̆ 7), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua 2 ̆ 7 Rotundiloba 2 ̆ 7) trees in containers were placed on load cells and one 30 mm TDP was placed into the trunk of each tree 30 cm above soil level. Over an extended time period, tree <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> was estimaged using load cells and TDPs. Hourly TDP <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> estimates for each species over a three day period indicate TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> followed similar trends as load cell estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> However, TDP estimates were generally less than load cell estimates, especially during peak transpiration periods.

40|$|Respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> in insects is a {{controversial}} topic. Whilst earlier studies considered respiratory transpiration a significant component of overall <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> {{to the extent}} that it was thought to be responsible not only for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) but also for variation in DGC patterns, later work repeatedly questioned its importance. In particular, investigations of the proportional contribution of respiratory transpiration to total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> in species showing DGCs suggested that respiratory transpiration was unlikely to be important in these species. In turn, these studies have been criticized on analytical grounds. In this study we investigated variation in cuticular and respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in five Scarabaeus dung beetle species, all of which show discontinuous gas exchange cycles, to ascertain the significance of respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> using modern analytical techniques. In particular, we determined whether there is variation in <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates amongst these beetles, whether both respiratory and cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates contribute significantly to variation in the former, and whether metabolic rate variation and variation in the duration of the DGC periods contribute significantly to variation in respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. Total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate varied such that species from arid areas had the lowest rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> and both cuticular and spiracular transpiration contributed significantly to variation in overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. Moreover, variation in metabolic rate and in the duration of the DGC periods contributed significantly to variation in respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. By contrast, examination of proportional <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> revealed little other than that it varies between 6. 5 % and 21 %, depending on the species and the temperature at which it was examined. Cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> scaled as mass 0. 721, but did not differ from that expected from geometric considerations alone. By contrast, respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> scaled as mass 0. 531, suggesting that gas exchange takes place by diffusion and convection.
