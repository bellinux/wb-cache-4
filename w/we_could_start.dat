In May 2009, Coyle announced that she had signed a publishing deal with EMI. She told Late Late Show host Pat Kenny, [...] "I'm writing songs and it's slightly different styles from Girls Aloud, so I'm gonna do that, writing stuff after Girls Aloud. [...] I have loads of material of stuff to do, but it's just about the timing and about getting it right and getting the right songs to put out." [...] She enlisted Barbara Charone, who was worked with Madonna and Christina Aguilera, as a publicist and Bruce Garfield as her manager. [...] "There wasn't anything wrong with what had happened or what had gone on for years - because it was really successful," [...] Nadine said. [...] "It just seemed like I had taken a completely different route, personally, in the writing and the production and I wanted a completely new team so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> afresh." [...] Despite early reports indicating three major record labels interested in Nadine, it was reported that she had failed to earn a solo record deal, even being turned down by Girls Aloud's label Polydor Records. This was denied by manager Bruce Garfield. In April 2010, it was reported she had signed to Geffen Records. The deal later fell through.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. It's plenty {{large enough}} for all of us, {{and there is a}} rough {{fireplace}} where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> a blaze and cook something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was across}} some time ago; but, if you like, I'll {{go along with}} you. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> as soon as we've {{arranged}} the few matters left open in Vancouver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Archibald," [...] said Mrs. Archibald, {{when they}} had retired to their room, [...] "I {{did not agree with}} you when you wished <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>started</b> for camp to-day, but now I am quite of your mind." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{dared not}} follow {{the banks of the}} {{subterranean}} river for fear lest we should fall into it again in the darkness. So after Good had rested a while, and we had drunk our fill of the water, which was sweet and fresh, and washed our faces, that needed it sadly, as well as <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> from the banks of this African Styx, and began to retrace our steps along the tunnel, Good dripping unpleasantly in front of us. At length we came to another gallery leading to our right.|$|R
40|$|I am {{delighted to}} welcome you to the launch of The International Journal of Physiotherapy and Research. I wish to extend my {{gratitude}} to the Executive Chief Editor {{and the members of}} the Editorial Board as they are the backbone of this scientific endeavour. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> notenvisage <b>starting</b> this journal without the support of the physiotherapists interested in research and wishing to make this journal a success...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was across}} some time ago, {{but if you}} would sooner I went with you, I'll come along. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> as soon as we've {{arranged}} the few matters left open in Vancouver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{soon as you}} are ready. I {{have ordered}} the mules, and you can bring what you think needful. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> after dinner, and I offer myself as escort {{for part of the}} way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> {{a circus}} jest {{as easy as}} a wink, Toby, 'cause you know all about one an' all you'd have {{to do would be}} to tell us fellers what to do, an' we'd 'tend to the rest." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "New York City Moves to the Sound of L.A." [...] explores a {{sense of}} 'yearning for {{something}} to happen' rather than a rivalry of the two cities music scenes. [...] "I was like, 'Fuck! I wish that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> just <b>start</b> our own thing.' And that's why I {{like being in a}} band. You kind of feel like that, like you're in your own tribe and you want to set out to start some sort of movement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! you ar' {{acquainted with}} the dish! Well, therein you have the {{advantage}} of me, in setting out, though I think I may say <b>we</b> <b>could</b> now <b>start</b> on equal ground. I should be the happiest fellow between Kentucky and the Rocky Mountains, if I had a snug cabin, near some old wood that was filled with hollow trees, just such a hump every day as that for dinner, a load of fresh straw for hives, and little El--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to ride--a long way away," [...] she declared, breathlessly. [...] "Or the motor-car--I shouldn't mind that. I should like {{to go as far}} away as ever we can, and stay away until it is dark. <b>Could</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> {{directly}} after breakfast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] he added, [...] "my {{marriage}} {{is becoming a}} necessity, if only for my mother's sake; and you stand far before any other woman with me, if that would but satisfy you. I verily believe that {{in a short time}} we should be just as comfortable together as if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> with more romance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start.</b> If I {{could have}} had you with me these last few months I'd never have quit. But I guess it's out of the question. You've no idea what sort of an inferno it is, and I won't let you come into it with your eyes shut. But if ever {{you are in a}} real tight corner let me know. It might be worth your while then to take a few risks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two nights {{would be}} enough at first," [...] Jack said; [...] "but I think, yes, I think I could get {{some of them to}} give that. Harry Shepherd would, I'm sure, and Bill Cummings, and Fred Wood, and I think five or six others. Yes, sir, I think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> it, and all I can do I will. It would do a sight--I mean a great deal of good. I'll come myself at first, sir, and then if any of them make a noise or play games with the {{schoolmaster}} I'll lick 'em next day." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first time}} I went punting was in company {{with three other}} fellows; {{they were going to}} show me how to do it. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not all <b>start</b> together, so I said I would go down first and get out the punt, and then I could potter about and {{practice}} a bit until they came.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am {{positively}} aching to be {{out again}} over the world with Dick," [...] she told him in a pause. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>start</b> to-morrow! But Dick can't start yet. He's in too deep with too many experiments and adventures on the ranch here. Why, {{what do you think}} he's up to now? As if he did not have enough on his hands, he's going to revolutionize the sales end, or, at least, the California and Pacific Coast portion of it, by making the buyers come to the ranch." ...|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the only}} time White played with the Beatles, but it was enough to get him [...] "into the history books", and the {{distinction}} of being one of the so-called [...] "fifth Beatles". White said that on that day in the studio the only members of the Beatles he worked with were Paul McCartney and John Lennon, because they were the songwriters. [...] "They didn't use any written music, and what I had to do was play the routines with them to get an idea what they wanted before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> even <b>start</b> recording." ...|$|R
60|$|Still, {{her heart}} was set upon having that monster, and she couldn't give it up. She thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> a dairy with it, and wanted me to help milk it; but I wouldn't; it was too risky. The sex wasn't right, and we hadn't any ladder anyway. Then she wanted to ride it, {{and look at the}} scenery. Thirty or forty feet of its tail was lying on the ground, like a fallen tree, and she thought she could climb it, but she was mistaken; {{when she got to the}} steep place it was too slick and down she came, and would have hurt herself but for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, Netta?" [...] {{the speaker}} went on. [...] "I know {{you said that}} you would not accept money as a loan even from me, which, as I told you, was very stupid and very disagreeable, but {{there is no reason why}} we should not do it in a {{business}} way. Other women go into business, why shouldn't I? As you know, I can't absolutely touch my money until I come of age, and it is nearly three years before that; still, I feel sure that the General would let me have some money, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> the Institute. It would be great fun. Of course, in the first place, you would be principal, or lady superintendent, or whatever you like to call yourself, and you would draw, say, five hundred pounds a year. After that we could divide the profits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If only a {{ship would}} come an' be wrecked here, now, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> fresh once more {{with a new}} lot maybe, but I'm {{not so sure about}} that either. P'r'aps we'd quarrel an' fight an' go through the bloody {{business}} all over again. No, it's better as it is. But a ship might touch in passin', an' we could prevail on two or three of the crew, or even one, to stop with us. What would I not give to hear a man's voice once more, a good growlin' bass. I wouldn't be partickler as to sentiments or grammar, not I, if it was only gruff, an' well spiced with sea-lingo an' smelt o' baccy. Not that I cares for baccy myself now, or grog either. Humph! it do make me a'most laugh to think o' the times I've said, ay, and thought, that I couldn't git along nohow without my pipe an' my glass. Why, I wouldn't give a chip of a brass farden for a pipe now, an' as to grog, after what I've seen of its cursed natur', I wouldn't taste a drop even if they was to offer to make me Lord High Admiral o' the British fleet for so doin'. But I would like once more to see a bearded man; even an unbearded one would be better than nothin'. Ah, well, it's no manner o' use sighin', any more than cryin', over spilt milk. Here I am, an' I suppose here I shall be to the end o' the chapter." ...|$|E
40|$|A 51 -year-old {{woman with}} {{exercise}} angina {{and a history}} of pulmonary artery hypertension related to a previous pulmonary thromboembolism, was referred to our hospital. Computed tomography and coronary angiography showed a 95 -mm aneurysm of the main pulmonary artery, which totally occluded the left main coronary artery. After a multidisciplinary evaluation, we recommended heart-lung transplantation, but the patient refused any kind of surgical procedure. Due to the chronic occlusion, stenting of the left main coronary artery was unfeasible. With no other options available, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>start</b> pulmonary antihypertensive therapy. At the 1 -year follow-up, the patient reported relief of her angina...|$|R
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on {{the sixth}} lap. The second caution flew on lap 10 for a three-car wreck in Turn 2 involving Jeffrey Earnhardt, Gray Gaulding and Reed Sorenson. Austin Dillon, who took his car to the garage prior to the initial start for a broken track bar and upper control arm, returned to the race 12 laps down. He said after the race that when he [...] "made a pace lap before the race I could feel something was broken. We {{had to go into}} the garage and make repairs before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> even <b>start</b> the race." ...|$|R
60|$|Still, {{the whole}} {{incident}} left a disagreeable impression on my mind, and I began to wish {{that we were}} safe across the Zambesi without more trouble. But <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>start</b> at once because two of the Zulus were still not well enough to travel {{and there were many}} preparations to be made about the loads, and so forth, since the waggon must be left behind. Also, and this was another complication--Hans had a sore upon his foot, resulting from the prick of a poisonous thorn, and it was desirable that this should be quite healed before we marched.|$|R
60|$|The frowns of {{the others}} {{infected}} me, and the dark pictures that were before their eyes appeared to mine; my words failed me and we all three sat gloomily. I had started with an excellent appetite, but again the others influenced me, and I could not eat. We toyed with our food, wishing the dinner over. I moved about restlessly, but Checco was quite still, leaning his face on his hand, occasionally raising his eyes and fixing them on Matteo or me. One of the servants dropped some plates; we all started at the sound, and Checco uttered an oath; I had never heard him swear before. He was so pale I wondered if he were nervous. I asked the time: still two hours before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start.</b> How long would they take to pass! I had been longing to finish dinner, so that I might {{get up and go}} away. I felt an urgent need for walking, but when the meal was over a heaviness came to my legs and I could do nothing but sit and look at the other two. Matteo filled his tankard and emptied it several times, but after awhile, as he reached over for the wine, he saw Checco's eyes fixed on the flagon, with a frown on his forehead, and the curious raising of one corner of the mouth, which was a sign he was displeased. Matteo withdrew his hand and pushed his mug away; it rolled over and fell on the floor. We heard the church bell strike the hour; it was three o'clock. Would it never be time! We sat on and on. At last Checco rose and began walking up and down the room. He called for his children. They came, and he began talking to them in a husky voice, so that they could scarcely understand him. Then, as if frightened of himself, he took them in his arms, one after the other, and kissed them convulsively, passionately, as one kisses a woman; and he told them to go. He stifled a sob. We sat on and on. I counted the minutes. I had never lived so long before. It was awful....|$|E
5000|$|The {{driver of}} the Vananchal Express, said that [...] "even though the green signal was given at 1.54am, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> the train only at 2.01am because we had not {{received}} any signal from the guard".|$|E
50|$|The closer {{the known}} square {{is to the}} unknown, the more {{accurate}} the approximation. For instance, to estimate the square root of 15, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> {{with the knowledge that}} the nearest perfect square is 16 (42).|$|E
50|$|The {{hole was}} about 150 feet {{up one of}} the loose stone cliffs one now knows so well. So we groped our way down it and over the moraine - the stars still lingering, as day was just dawning. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>start</b> at 1:30, the proper time, as there was no moon and we wanted light as we had to tramp the glacier at once. Rubi led, and off we went, roped and in Indian file, in the old {{treadmill}} way over the slippery ploughed-field-like snow that lay on the upper glacier, for a pull without a check of one or two hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity we haven't all {{the rest}} of the things on board," [...] the skipper said, [...] "and then <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>started</b> by this evening's tide instead of waiting till the morning. The wind is fair, and I hate {{throwing}} away a fair wind. There is no saying where it may blow tomorrow, but I shouldn't be at all surprised if it isn't round to the south, and that will be foul for us till we get pretty nigh up into the mouth of the river. However, I gave them till tonight for getting all their things on board and must therefore wait." ...|$|R
60|$|Next day we rested the hounds, and {{got things}} into packing shape with the {{intention}} of starting early the following morning. But it rained on and off; and the day after that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not find Haught's burros, and not until the fourth morning <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>start.</b> It turned out that Buck did not have a broken leg and had recovered surprisingly from the injury he had received. Aloof as he held himself it appeared certain {{he did not want to}} be left behind.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{felt like}} a prostitute," [...] Sukie said. [...] "We were playing the same old songs and {{receiving}} money on the way back. My fire was gone. We really needed a break so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> fresh for the second album." ...|$|E
5000|$|As we were {{building}} and evolving our sketch comedy, we {{would look for}} new types of sketches that had legs (not caterpillar legs).

5000|$|When {{asked about}} a further sequel during an IGN {{interview}} with Sugiura, he indicated that the development staff {{who worked on the}} title were pursuing a different game, but remarked, [...] "However, it does not mean the world of Baten Kaitos will end. There is a possibility that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>start</b> to develop the title if certain circumstances and conditions are met".|$|E
5000|$|Given a Young tableau S, we {{construct}} the polytabloid eS as above. Without loss of generality, all columns of S are increasing, otherwise <b>we</b> <b>could</b> instead <b>start</b> with the modified Young tableau with increasing columns, whose polytabloid will differ at most by a sign. S is then said {{to not have}} any column descents. We want to express eS as a linear combination of standard polytabloids, i.e. polytabloids associated to standard Young tableaux. To do this, we would like permutations πi such that in all tableaux Sπi, a row descent has been eliminated, with [...] This then expresses S in terms of polytabloids that are closer to being standard. The permutations that achieve this are the Garnir elements.|$|R
60|$|At midnight all was over, {{and we sat}} in the {{presence}} of four corpses. We covered them with such rags as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find, and <b>started</b> away, fastening the door behind us. Their home must be these people's grave, for they could not have Christian burial, or be admitted to consecrated ground. They were as dogs, wild beasts, lepers, and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and smitten outcasts.|$|R
40|$|One {{would not}} have {{expected}} {{just a few years}} ago that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> observationally <b>start</b> probing the reionization process in the redshift range 6 − 30. This is indeed extremely exciting, because we are in a completely uncharted water. I will review some of the latest developments on cosmological reionization and suggest, in a somewhat more personal way, that the universe may be reionized twice in order to paint a picture that is consistent with all observations, including SDSS quasar observations, WMAP CMB experiment and Lyα forest observations. It is my pleasure to speak in this conference, as an astrophysicist, to honor Dr. Yukawa, a giant figure in the twentieth century physics. The experimental proof of the existence of mesons predicted by Yukawa’s theory was intimately related to astrophysics and came earlier from high energy cosmic rays interacting with th...|$|R
