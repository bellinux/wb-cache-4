40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} {{different}} resource allocation schemes, transmission coordination mechanisms among base stations, and user association rules {{in the context of}} the downlink of a heterogeneous network comprising of a macro base station overlaid with a pool of low-power pico base stations. We formulate flow-based models for the joint optimization of resource allocation, user association, user scheduling and transmission coordination under a proportional fair throughput objective for two types of resource allocation, i. e, Full Sharing (FS) and Channel Splitting (CS), and two types of transmission coordination, i. e., no coordination and ON-OFF coordination. Our formulations allow us to obtain exact solutions for small to medium sized networks. The numerical results show that the performance of FS without transmission coordination among BSs is much worse than CS without coordination. However, FS with our coordination mechanism performs as well as CS with coordination. Interestingly, FS and CS with coordination do not perform much better than CS without coordination. Our study provides a message that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go for the complexity of transmission coordination among BSs depending upon the resource allocation scheme. I...|$|R

However, forestry creates young plantations offering a superabundant food supply for moose. Using two spatial scales, we tested whether the landscape-level environmental requirements of the capercaillie and moose differ. We compared the spatial association between the abundances of the two species in 50 -[*]×[*] 50 -km grids and, using a set of regression models, analyzed how it was affected by various land use variables in five regions of Finland. Both species were generally most abundant in the same grid cells. Moreover, the association between abundance and several landscape variables was very similar for both species. Forest cover had a positive impact on both species in Eastern and South-Western Finland. Only in Western Finland was the capercaillie more positively associated with older forest than the moose. Human impact variables were negatively related to both capercaillie and moose abundance in Eastern and South-Western Finland, the effect being stronger for capercaillie. In Northern Finland, human impact turned positive. Our results highlight that, on broad landscape and regional scales, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make trade-offs in management decisions concerning capercaillie and moose.

50|$|In a paper read at the Conference of Modern Churchmen in 1967 titled “Jesus, the Revelation of God,” Montefiore {{offers a}} {{controversial}} {{interpretation of the}} early life of Jesus. Jesus {{was not aware of}} his vocation as Messiah until approximately age thirty, Montefiore argues, and this vocation can therefore not explain the celibacy of Jesus. Apart from the Essenes, celibacy was not a common practice in Jewish life. Montefiore suggest <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> look for a non-religious reason to explain the celibacy of Jesus:Men usually remain unmarried for three reasons: either because they cannot afford to marry or there are no girls to marry (neither of these factors need have deterred Jesus); or because it is inexpedient for them to marry in the light of their vocation (we have already ruled this out during the ‘hidden years’ of Jesus’ life); or because they are homosexual in nature, in as much as women hold no special attraction for them. The homosexual explanation is one which we must not ignore.Montefiore finds the explanation that Jesus was homosexual consistent with his identification with the poor and oppressed:All the synoptic gospels show Jesus in close relationship with the ‘outsiders’ and the unloved. Publicans and sinners, prostitutes and criminals are among his acquaintances and companions. If Jesus were homosexual in nature (and this is the true explanation of his celibate state) then this would be further evidence of God’s self-identification with those who are unacceptable to the upholders of ‘The Establishment’ and social conventions.|$|E
40|$|Changing an object’s {{appearance}} by adding geometric details is desirable in many real-world applications. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> want to know, for example, how a wall would look after adding some geometrical bumps, or {{how a person}} would look after adding wrinkles {{on his or her}} face. Direct methods for adding geometric details to an object require modeling the object and the surface details. It’s usually not a trivial task to build a 3 D model for a real object. It’s also tedious and labor intensive to model and create surface details with existing geometric modeling tools. Bump mapping has acted as an alternative to adding geometrical details to an otherwise smooth object. But constructing visually interesting bump maps requires practice and artistic skills. Computer vision techniques have helped for modeling real-world objects and their surface details. Techniques include the use of laser scanner, stereo algorithms, shape from lighting variation, 1 shape from shading, 2 and so on. However, some of these techniques require specialized equipment. Many other techniques require at least two images of each object, and capturing highresolution geometrical details robustly can be difficult. Although the shape-from-shading technique only requires a single image, this approach usually requires knowledge of the lighting condition and reflectance functions of the surface material. Three-dimensional recognition and reconstruction from a single image have used linear classes of objects. 3, 4 A novel technique transfers geometric details from one surface to another with simple 2 D image operations. But this reconstruction technique doesn’t generate accurate geometric details. In our approach, for cases where we only want to transfer geometrical details from one object <b>to</b> another, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> explicitly compute 3 D structures.

30|$|Whether PDT is {{performed}} under general anesthesia or sedation depends on each surgeon’s decision. In our institution, PDT under general anesthesia {{was selected for}} the stable operation field. The technique of pulse oximetry {{is based on the}} principle that oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb red and near-infrared light differently [5]. The MASIMO pulse oximeter probe emits red light at 660  nm and infrared light at 940  nm. Moreover, talaporfin sodium has a longer absorption at 664  nm, and the laser light of 664  nm activates talaporfin sodium as an anticancer drug [3, 4]. Both the red light emitted by pulse oximetry and the laser light are characterized by the same wavelength zone, leading us to conclude that the blister was photosensitivity dermatitis caused by the red light from the pulse oximeter. All pulse oximeter probes use similar wavelengths. Pulse oximeter sensory associated blisters must occur when using other probes. There were two previous reports of skin burns related to pulse oximetry using photofrin and mTHPC during PDT. Probes were continuously applied to patients’ fingers for 3 and 48  h [6, 7]. We predicted that shorter exposure time to red light from pulse oximetry would prevent skin phototoxicity. Nevertheless, this case showed that pulse oximetry can cause skin burns regardless of the length of pulse oximetry attachment time and the kinds of photosensitizers. Pulse oximetry is a standard monitor in anesthesia cases to detect hypoxia [5]. The World Health Organization recommends pulse oximetry for all anesthetic patients for perioperative safety [8]. There is no superior monitoring to pulse oximetry for measuring oxygenation, even during PDT. Therefore, we should monitor peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry as little as possible or intermittently. In future cases, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>need</b> arterial cannulation <b>to</b> assess blood oxygenation, if {{we will not be able}} to apply pulse oximetry.|$|R
40|$|Understanding Stanislavskian {{practice}} in the UK conservatoire is a complex task {{for at least three}} reasons. Firstly, there is the challenge of grasping the system itself. Secondly, there is the complexity of tracing the multiple branches of the Stanislavski ‘family tree’. Finally, as David Shirley explains, the transmission of his ideas to the UK was a ‘piecemeal’ process extended over many years, often obscured by imperfect translations and limited contact with Russian practitioners. The additional project of revitalizing the system for the 21 st century is, therefore, highly problematic. This paper explores how cognitive science might provide some powerful tools for such a task. I begin by discussing some of the aesthetic and scientific ideas that shaped Stanislavski’s view of emotion, including the widely-reported influence of Théodule Ribot. I then consider how Stanislavski departed from Ribot and developed a distinctive, multi-faceted theory of emotion in the creative process, a conception that incorporated Vakhtangov’s notion of ‘affective emotion’. I consider the questions, what exactly is ‘affective emotion’, how widely is it understood in the UK, and is it supported by the current science? I then turn to contemporary theories of emotion, drawing particularly on Damasio’s updating of Jamesian psychology. I propose a link between ‘affective emotion’ and Damasio’s ‘as-if’ body loop. Furthermore, I discuss some key questions relating to future actor training: how <b>might</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reconfigure our {{practice in}} the light of the science and what alternative models of acted emotion have emerged to compete with the Stanislavskian paradigm...|$|R

40|$|Since 1995, the Italian Lega Nord (LN) {{political}} party has depicted {{itself as the}} defender of Padania, a territory that covers the mainly affluent regions of Northern Italy. Around this politico-spatial territory, the LN has shaped an identity based {{on the notion of}} Popolo Padano (the Padanian People). Since the new millennium, LN rhetoric has increasingly focused - stemming more from the demands of realpolitik than those of conviction - on opposing irregular immigration per se and, more specifically, Islam and Muslim immigration. In the eyes of the LN propagandists and their media, the theology of Islam and its practitioners represent a growing threat to the modern Italian and Padanian identity (and tradition). The LN has not been alone in using the media to oppose Islam; the Italian media has reinforced LN messages; Muslims are generally depicted as dangerous and compared with terrorists and their religion and culture are described as the opposite of Italian/West values. Something approximating to a "moral panic" around this issue has ensued. Integral to this are notions of morality combined with practices of moral entrepreneurship. What follows seeks to highlight the LN's stereotypical depictions of Islam.

40|$|Viewpoint ArticleViewpoint: Design for Manufacturing Assembly Automation AA 32 - 2 (Design for Manufacturing) At {{this time}} of writing, the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) {{indicated}} that the UK Manufacturing has hit a 28 -month low. As output, new orders and employment have declined; the UK manufacturing sector fell back into contraction to its lowest level since June 2009. It {{is a sign of}} low market confidence and uncertainty. In the report, the most worrying aspect is that new orders have nose dived most since March 2009 and output is now sustained through a backlog of work. The traditional manufacturing industries that have kept the UK economy buoyant is facing bleak times {{and the fact that the}} Eurozone is also in a crisis. Despite these troubled times, the UK Government hopes that precision engineering and high-value manufacturing sector will create jobs and help tackle record youth unemployment. One such industry is the aviation sector where Design for Manufacturing has been used as a good industry practice so that products can be manufactured more easily without sacrificing safety. Fundamentally, this can be achieved through two principles: reducing the number of assembly operations by part reduction; or by making the assembly operation easier to perform. This has been something of a holy grail to manufacturing industries where part reduction, cutting the use of fasteners and light-weight materials are favourable for cost savings. Recently, the BBC featured an episode on “Making a Super Jumbo Wing” for the Airbus A 380 as part of the “How to Build” Series. The wing is the largest ever produced for a commercial aircraft at 17. 7 metres from front to back and 36. 3 metres from fuselage to wingtip. In the documentary, the manufacturer claims that shaving a thickness of 1 millimetre of material per wing equates to a reduction of 350 kilograms of weight, translating this to significant cost savings for the 238 A 380 s currently on order. Using the Design for Manufacturing approach has led to a new wing design with greater rigidity, better stability, more accurate aligning and reduced installation times without sacrificing safety. Rolls-Royce is another example of a high value manufacturer and applies the concept of "invent once and use many". For instance, the MT 30 turbines that are used to power the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carriers and other combat ships is based on the same technology as the Trent jet engine and shares a majority of the components. While the old saying that traditional manufacturing is slowing down is true, it contradicts the new growth of research, design, additive manufacture, precision engineering and high value production. Even more so, greater spin-off effects can be seen such as when British Prime Minister David Cameron opened a new high-tech £ 400 m Airbus factory at Broughton in October and said that the plane maker would safeguard thousands of jobs for many years to come. The factory employs 6000 people at the site with 650 jobs, and is considered as one of the largest manufacturing facilities built in recent years. But will this be enough to give the industry a sustainable future? Probably yes for the next few decades, but when other developing nations play the catch-up game in terms of technology, then <b>we</b> <b>might</b> inevitably <b>need</b> <b>to</b> rethink our manufacturing strategies. * Dr Eujin Pei works as a Senior Lecturer at De Montfort University in the United Kingdom with a research interest in additive manufacture and inclusive design...|$|R
