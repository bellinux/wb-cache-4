25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the <b>window</b> <b>down.</b> Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was {{at the door with}} my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back <b>window</b> <b>down</b> a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E

6000|$|Alas! {{there was}} only one {{available}} space, a narrow wall between the two west windows. [...] "We'll cut the <b>windows</b> <b>down,</b> or move them," [...] I said, with calm resolution.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spokesman}} for DES {{said it was}} similar to [...] "leaving your car unlocked, with the <b>windows</b> <b>down</b> and keys left in the ignition and then acting surprised when your car is stolen." ...|$|R
60|$|He stood bareheaded {{upon the}} {{pavement}} for a moment, and Selina's eyes and smile had never worked harder. Mary leaned back, too angry to speak. Selina and Mr. Bullsom sat well forward, and pulled both <b>windows</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Felix {{pointed in}} silence to the crowded {{carriage}} {{from which she}} had emerged. Frances Freeland looked a little rueful. [...] "It would have been delightful," [...] she said. [...] "There was a dear baby there and, of course, I couldn't have the <b>window</b> <b>down,</b> so it WAS rather hot." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked out}} of the open <b>window.</b> <b>Down</b> in the street a footman was {{settling}} the rug over the knees of a lady in a carriage, and the decorous immovability of both their faces, which were clearly visible to him, was like a portion of some well-oiled engine.|$|E
60|$|But Eunice {{could not}} do that. There {{was too much to}} attend to. She went out to the hall and threw up the <b>window.</b> <b>Down</b> below, at a safe distance, Charles Holland was waiting. The cold wind blew up to Eunice the odor of the {{disinfectants}} with which he had steeped himself.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the Eagle and Master. The easiest to identify is the post between the front door wing windows and the roll <b>down</b> <b>windows.</b> On the Eagle the chrome divider between these two <b>windows</b> goes <b>down</b> as the <b>window</b> goes <b>down,</b> where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go <b>down</b> with the <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|Holland Park and Alderley Substations are of {{very similar}} design {{with the main}} {{frontage}} having small high set windows above the main entrance, with the side elevations also having small high set windows, with much larger <b>windows</b> <b>down</b> below.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't think we'll be wrecked, do you?" [...] asked Sam, as he {{left his}} duty as fireman {{and came to the}} wheelhouse, where Dick stood, with all the <b>windows</b> <b>down,</b> trying to peer forth through the fury of the elements.|$|R
60|$|He {{rose and}} {{pushed open the}} door. The mother sat with the babe in her lap, looking out of the <b>window</b> <b>down</b> across the superb field of timothy, moving like a lake of purple water. She did not look around. She only grew rigid. Her thin neck throbbed with the pulsing of blood to her head.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Fosbrook moved {{nearer to}} the <b>window.</b> <b>Down</b> below there was {{certainly}} not much to be seen; only Pierce cleaning the knives in the knife-house, and Martha washing out her pans before the dairy-door; {{but that was not}} where she looked. She turned the little half- fretful face upwards. [...] "Look there!" [...] she said; [...] "and talk of seeing nothing pretty!" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{this was}} his usual hour for having a little {{confidential}} chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen {{that she was going}} to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open <b>window,</b> <b>down</b> into the street.|$|E
5000|$|Sharing the {{underpinnings}} {{and much}} of the roofline with the redesigned Ford Thunderbird for 1972, the Mark IV was given distinct body styling from the <b>windows</b> <b>down.</b> In addition, the Mark was distinguished by hidden headlights and the [...] "Continental spare tire" [...] trunklid.|$|R

60|$|Then I saw lighted <b>windows</b> <b>down</b> at {{the other}} end of the front part of the house. I walked down. A door stood open and through it I saw a room {{identical}} with that {{at the other}} corner; and here were Colonel Sampson, Wright, and several other men, all smoking and talking.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} your {{daughter}} to ketch her death o' cold you'll keep that window open!" [...] As she said this, she leaned back and pulled the <b>window</b> <b>down</b> with her own strong right arm. [...] "I guess the driver knows what he is about," [...] she continued, [...] "this not bein' the first time he's gone over the road." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{no reply}} {{came from the}} {{apparently}} insensate Miggles. The Judge, who had finally got the <b>window</b> <b>down,</b> put his head out and propounded a series of questions, which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery, but which the driver evaded by replying that [...] "if we didn't want {{to sit in the}} coach all night we had better rise up and sing out for Miggles." ...|$|E
6000|$|It chanced that Shirley, {{the moment}} before, had been gazing from a <b>window</b> <b>down</b> on the park. She {{had seen that}} stormy {{moonlight}} which [...] "le Professeur Louis" [...] was perhaps {{at the same instant}} contemplating from her own oak-parlour lattice; she had seen the isolated trees of the domain--broad, strong, spreading oaks, and high-towering heroic beeches--wrestling with the gale. Her ear had caught the full roar of the forest lower down; the swift rushing of clouds, the moon, to the eye, hasting swifter still, had crossed her vision. She turned from sight and sound--touched, if not rapt; wakened, if not inspired.|$|E
50|$|Ducas {{was signed}} by WhiteStar Entertainment in September 2008, but the label folded before any {{material}} could be released. In August 2010, he released an extended play titled Volume Up, <b>Windows</b> <b>Down.</b> On October 2013, he released 4340, the third album in his career and first in 16 years, through the newly created independent label Loud Ranch.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{the track}} {{appeared}} in {{an episode of}} the popular Discovery Channel show MythBusters. In the episode, the show's hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage used the track to test the myth that a car will have better fuel mileage with the air conditioner on and windows closed than it would {{with all of the}} <b>windows</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Says Hoy {{about her}} writing process: [...] "While writing I often reminisce about {{the feeling of}} driving on country roads at night where we grew up, all the <b>windows</b> <b>down</b> and the cool air {{whipping}} your face after a hot summer day. That feeling is pure life, similar to what you feel when a song overtakes you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What an amusingly superb affair!" [...] Basil {{cried as}} they glanced {{through an open}} <b>window</b> <b>down</b> the long vista of the saloon. [...] "Good heavens!

Well, I shall never be satisfied with less hereafter," [...] he added. [...] "I am spoilt for ordinary paint and upholstery from this hour; I am a ruinous spendthrift, and a humble three-story swell-front up at the South End {{is no longer the}} place for me.

60|$|Ethelberta's absence {{had become}} unaccountable to Lord Mountclere, who could hardly permit her {{retirement}} from his sight for a minute. But {{at first he}} had made due allowance for her eccentricity as a woman of genius, and would not take notice of the half-hour's desertion, unpardonable {{as it might have}} been in other classes of wives. Then he had inquired, searched, been alarmed: he had finally sent men-servants in all directions about the park to look for her. He feared she had fallen out of a <b>window,</b> <b>down</b> a well, or into the lake. The next stage of search was to have been drags and grapnels: but Ethelberta entered the house.|$|E
60|$|Under {{a bright}} mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was safely {{conveyed}} in his carriage, with one <b>window</b> <b>down,</b> {{to partake of}} this al-fresco party; {{and in one of}} the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.|$|E
60|$|The Sunrise Hotel {{had seen}} better days. It was a five story brick building, {{blackened}} {{by age and}} had numerous small <b>windows,</b> <b>down</b> in front of which ran an iron fire escape.

50|$|The Series CA Master {{replaced}} the 1933 Eagle mid {{way through the}} model year when the 1933 Standard model (Series CC) was introduced. Several changes {{were made to the}} Eagle when the name was changed to Master. The easiest to identify is the post between the front door wing windows and the roll <b>down</b> <b>windows.</b> On the Eagle the chrome divider between these two <b>windows</b> goes <b>down</b> as the <b>window</b> goes <b>down,</b> where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go <b>down</b> with the <b>window.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{was well}} on in the {{afternoon}} when she {{drove back to the}} city with Mr. Brinsmade. Neither of them had eaten since morning, nor had they even thought of hunger. Mr. Brinsmade was silent, leaning back {{in the corner of the}} carriage, and Virginia absorbed in her own thoughts. Drawing near the city, that dreaded sound, the rumble of drums, roused them. A shot rang out, and they were jerked violently by the starting of the horses. As they dashed across Walnut at Seventh came the fusillade. Virginia leaned out of the <b>window.</b> <b>Down</b> the vista of the street was a mass of blue uniforms, and a film of white smoke hanging about the columns of the old Presbyterian Church Mr. Brinsmade quietly drew her back into the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|Minnie, {{hearing the}} door slam violently, ran in alarm to the <b>window.</b> <b>Down</b> the street a slender man {{was getting into}} a cab. The Bacteriologist, hatless, and in his carpet slippers, was running and gesticulating wildly towards this group. One slipper came off, {{but he did not}} wait for it. [...] "He has gone mad!" [...] said Minnie; [...] "it's that horrid science of his"; and, opening the window, would have called after him. The slender man, {{suddenly}} glancing round, seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder. He pointed hastily to the Bacteriologist, said something to the cabman, the apron of the cab slammed, the whip swished, the horse's feet clattered, and in a moment cab and Bacteriologist hotly in pursuit, had receded up the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner.|$|E

25|$|The general {{proportions}} of the chapel use the length as the unit of measurement. This has been divided by three to get the width and by two to get the height.
