500|$|The {{trial began}} on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, [...] "I suppose {{the reason you}} put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so {{that no matter what}} they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always be able to say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'." [...] Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, [...] "My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice {{at the end of the}} sentence that there was a great big question mark on it." [...] The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea." [...] Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: [...] "Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!" [...] Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as [...] "Colonel".|$|E

As proof, he showed {{a copy of a}} driver's license application made by Qazi under a false name but bearing his photograph. Apparently, the people who had been sheltering Qazi were now prepared to accept the multimillion-dollar reward offer for his capture. Other sources claim they were pressured by the Pakistani government. Qazi stated [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> (that) the people who tricked me ... were Pushtuns, they were owners of land in the Leghari and Khosa clan areas in Dera Ghazi Khan, but I will never name them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Holt said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that I don't see homeschooling as {{some kind}} of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for the {{exploration}} of the world which we call learning or education. Home would be the best base no matter how good the schools were." [...] One common theme in the homeschool philosophies of both Holt and that of the Moores is that home education should not attempt to bring the school construct into the home, or a view of education as an academic preliminary to life. They viewed home education as a natural, experiential aspect of life that occurs as the members of the family are involved with one another in daily living.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, {{a participant in the}} Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business and your own property, {{would you be willing to}} trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you when we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E

Sometimes Redenbacher appeared in commercials with his grandson. Some customers wrote letters asking if Redenbacher was a real person, and not an actor (see, e.g., Bartles & Jaymes).
