It {{can meet the}} 60 % greenhouse gas saving requirements (as compared to the replaced fossil fuel) specified in the EU Renewable Energy Directive, if allowance is made for carbon sequestration, green electricity is used and the vehicle is optimized for gaseous biomethane. The issue in this paper {{is the effect of}} the digester type on the overall emissions savings. Examining three digestion configurations; dry continuous (DCAD), <b>wet</b> <b>continuous</b> (WCAD), and a two phase system (SLBR-UASB), {{it was found that the}} reactor type can result in a variation of 15 % in emissions savings. The system that as modeled produced most biogas, and fuelled a vehicle most distance, the two phase system (SLBR-UASB), was the least sustainable due to biogas losses in the dry batch step. The system as modeled which produced the least biogas (DCAD) was the most sustainable as the parasitic demands on the system were least. Optimal reactor design for sustainability criteria should maximize biogas production, while minimizing biogas losses and parasitic demands.

40|$|Grass is an {{excellent}} energy crop; it may be classified as a high yielding, low energy input, perennial crop. Over 90 % of Irish agricultural land is under grass; thus farmers are familiar with, and comfortable with, this crop {{as opposed to a}} "new energy crop" such as Miscanthus. Of issue therefore is not the crop, but the methodology of generating energy from the crop. Numerous farmers across Europe (in particular Germany and Austria) use grass silage as a feedstock for biogas production; in a number of cases the produced biogas is scrubbed to biomethane and used as a transport fuel or injected into the natural gas grid. Many Irish farmers are considering converting from conventional farming such as beef production to grass biomethane production. Numerous technologies and combinations of such technologies are available; from one-stage batch dry systems to two-stage <b>wet</b> <b>continuous</b> systems; from one-stage continuous wet systems to two-stage systems incorporating a batch dry reactor coupled with a second stage high-rate reactor.

40|$|The {{presence}} of deleterious substances and their transport {{are among the}} most important factors controlling the durability of cementitious composites. The present paper studies the relationship among the applied mechanical deterioration in terms of splitting tensile deformation, curing conditions and chloride ion permeability of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs) that contain different supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). Three SCMs, representing a wide range of compositions, were used in the study. The splitting tensile deformations are introduced to generate microcracks in ECC specimens, where cylindrical specimens were pre-loaded to different deformation levels. After that, the mechanically pre-cracked and pristine ECC specimens were exposed to three different curing conditions (continuous <b>wet,</b> <b>continuous</b> air, and freeze-thaw cycle) for up to 2 months. Rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT), microscopic observation and microstructural analysis were used to assess the rate and extent of self-healing. Test results indicate that the SCM type greatly affects the self-healing capability of cementitious composites as measured by chloride ion permeability. Although ECC samples with fly ash have more unhydrated cementitious materials, and therefore, expectedly, a higher capacity for self-healing, more evident self-healing product was observed from the ECC mixture incorporating slag. Therefore, in addition to the crack width distribution and curing condition, the reaction products associated with SCMs have a great impact on the self-healing capability of cementitious composites.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} {{investigated the}} predictive performance of pavement marking retroreflectivity measured {{under various conditions}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting.</b> The researcher compared nighttime detection distance of pavement markings in simulated rain conditions and the retroreflectivity of the same pavement markings in several <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> conditions. Correlation analyses quantified the predictive performance of the resulting retroreflectivity values from the <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> conditions. The researcher measured the retroreflectivity of 18 pavement marking samples under 14 different conditions. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has three standards for measuring the retroreflectivity of pavement markings under: dry (E- 1710), recovery (E- 2177), and <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> conditions (E- 2176). Using three ASTM standard conditions resulted in three sets of retroreflectivity data, and variations of the <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> standard produced an additional 11 sets of <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> condition data. The researcher also incorporated detection distance values measured for the same 18 pavement marking samples under three different simulated rainfall conditions at night. The three conditions included: high (0. 87 in/hr), medium (0. 52 in/hr), and low (0. 28 in/hr) flow rates, these rates were to simulate typical rainfall rates {{in the state of}} Texas. The correlation analyses measures the linear relationship as well as the logarithmic relationship between the detection distance and the retroreflectivity of the pavement markings. A pavement markings' retroreflectivity is typically used as a detection distance performance indicator, therefore a high degree of correlation between retroreflectivity and detection distance would be desired. A high degree of correlation would indicate that a measured retroreflectivity value of a pavement marking would provide a good indication of the expected detection distance. The researcher conducted analyses for several subgroups of the pavement markings based on the markings type or characteristics. Dry, recovery, and all the <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> retroreflectivity data were correlated to the detection distances. Correlation values found during this thesis research did not show a high degree of correlation for most of the subgroups analyzed. This indicates that measured retroreflectivity would not provide very good predictive performance of the pavement markings detection distance in rainy conditions...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{rainfall}} distribution patterns {{around the world}} have caused fluctuations in those climate regimes. Agriculture is particularly vulnerable to climatic conditions and it is chief among the systems that are expected to undergo changes as a consequence of climate change. This study analyses the climate change variability through the fluctuation in precipitation pattern and evaporation, in low country intermediate zone (IL 1 a) agro ecological region based on Gumbel’s frequency distribution analysis on wet day rainfall data. Focusing on a cascade agricultural system in the Katupotha divisional secretariat division of the Kurunegala district that is located in the IL 1 a, the climate change variability was analysed using daily rainfall data of fifty years (1961 - 2010) together with long term evaporation data. Experimental methodology considered a day to be wet only if the rainfall exceeded its evaporation. This was considered as the precipitation amount that could potentially be used by the crops. Gumbel’s frequency analysis was employed to derive the variability in <b>continuous</b> <b>wet</b> day {{rainfall distribution}} at 25 year time intervals (1961 - 1985 and 1986 - 2010). The total <b>continuous</b> <b>wet</b> day rainfall and seasonal total <b>continuous</b> <b>wet</b> day rainfall frequency distributions were analysed using the technique. Results of the analysis show an increasing trend in magnitude of the total <b>continuous</b> <b>wet</b> day precipitations from 1961 - 2010. This increasing trend is observed beyond 2. 2 years recurrence interval. At longer recurrence intervals (20 years) a 50 mm increase is experienced during the last 25 years (1986 - 2010) while at shorter recurrence intervals (2. 2 years), a 6 mm increase is evident. A distinct increasing trend in the total <b>continuous</b> <b>wet</b> day precipitation from 1961 - 2010 was observed during the second inter-monsoon which was a 165 mm increase at a 10 year recurrence interval.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this essay aims at {{investigating}} the already available and promising technologies for the biogas and bio-hydrogen production from anaerobic digestion of different organic substrates. One strives to show all the peculiarities of this complicate process, such as continuity, number of stages, moisture, biomass preservation and rate of feeding. The main outcome of this part is the awareness of the huge amount of reactor configurations, each of which suitable for a few types of substrate and circumstance. Among the most remarkable results, one may consider first of all the <b>wet</b> <b>continuous</b> stirred tank reactors (CSTR), right to face the high waste production rate in urbanised and industrialised areas. Then, there is the up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB), aimed at the biomass preservation in case of highly heterogeneous feedstock, which can also be treated in a wise co-digestion scheme. On the other hand, smaller and scattered rural realities can be served by either wet low-rate digesters for homogeneous agricultural by-products (e. g. fixed-dome) or the cheap dry batch reactors for lignocellulose waste and energy crops (e. g. hybrid batch-UASB). The biological and technical aspects raised during the first chapters are later supported with bibliographic research on the important and multifarious large-scale applications the products of the anaerobic digestion may have. After the upgrading techniques, particular care was devoted to their importance as biofuels, highlighting a further and more flexible solution consisting in the reforming to syngas. Then, one shows the electricity generation and the associated heat conversion, stressing on the high potential of fuel cells (FC) as electricity converters. Last but not least, both the use as vehicle fuel and the injection into the gas pipes are considered as promising applications. The consideration of the still important issues of the bio-hydrogen management (e. g. storage and delivery) may lead to the conclusion that it would be far more challenging to implement than bio-methane, which can potentially “inherit” the assets of the similar fossil natural gas. Thanks to the gathered knowledge, one devotes a chapter to the energetic and financial study of a hybrid power system supplied by biogas and made of different pieces of equipment (natural gas thermocatalitic unit, molten carbonate fuel cell and combined-cycle gas turbine structure). A parallel analysis on a bio-methane-fed CCGT system is carried out in order to compare the two solutions. Both studies show that the apparent inconvenience of the hybrid system actually emphasises the importance of extending the computations to a broader reality, i. e. the upstream processes for the biofuel production and the environmental/social drawbacks due to fossil-derived emissions. Thanks to this “boundary widening”, one can realise the hidden benefits of the hybrid over the CCGT system. ...|$|E

A three-year experiment was carried out to study the removal of nitrogen and organics through a simulated soil aquifer treatment (SAT) system under <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> and wetting/drying conditions. The removal performance of nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was improved in the wetting/drying column. The average removal efficiencies of the three years were 51 % and 78 % for the NO 3 –N, 41 % and 51 % for the NH 4 –N, and 40 % and 50 % for the COD in the <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> and wetting/drying columns. Nitrogen and COD removal mainly took place within the top 20 cm of the columns, which was highly correlated with the distribution of microorganisms. The amount of microorganisms was also positively correlated with the content of organic matter and dissolved oxygen (DO) in both soil columns. NO 3 –N can be removed effectively via aerobic denitrifying bacteria as the DO concentration was 3 – 6 mg/L. DO and NO 3 –N were simultaneously reduced as the electron acceptors for COD degradation, and DO only accounted for 40 % of total electron acceptor in COD degradation for the <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> column.

The system is modelled by the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson functional, with fluid-substrate couplings which control the wettability of the substrate. We investigate the filling and wetting phenomena within the mean-field approximation, and compare with the predictions of the macroscopic and interfacial Hamiltonian theories. For large values of L and under bulk coexistence conditions, we observe first-order filling transitions between dry (D) and partially filled (F) interfacial states, and wetting transitions between partially filled F and completely wet (W) interfacial states of the same order as for the flat substrate. Depending {{on the order of}} the wetting transition, the transition temperature is either shifted towards lower temperatures for first-order wetting or it coincides with the wetting temperature on the flat substrate for <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting.</b> On the other hand, if the groove height is of order of the correlation length, only wetting transitions between D and W states are observed under bulk coexistence conditions. For this case, the transition temperature shift obeys approximately Wenzel’s phenomenological law if the substrate favors first-order wetting, but it remains unshifted for <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting.</b> The borderline between the small and large L regimes correspond to a D − F − W triple point if wetting is first-order, and a D − F critical point for <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting.</b> Beyond bulk coexistence conditions, filling and first-order wetting transitions continue into off-coexistence filling and prewetting lines, which end up at critical points.

Membrane {{emulsification}} (ME) {{is a new}} technology for making monodisperse emulsions over {{a wide spectrum of}} mean droplet sizes, ranging from cca. 0. 5 μm to several tens of μm. ME involves production of droplets individually (drop-by-drop) by extrusion of pure disperse phase through a porous membrane into moving continuous phase (direct ME) or the passage of previously prepared coarse emulsion (premix) through the membrane (premix ME). The membrane must not be <b>wetted</b> with the <b>continuous</b> phase, i. e. O/W emulsions are prepared using a hydrophilic membrane and W/O emulsions using a hydrophobic membrane. If the membrane wall is <b>wetted</b> with the <b>continuous</b> phase, droplet disruption can be followed by phase inversion, i. e. a fine W/O emulsion can be produced from the O/W coarse emulsion and vice versa. In order to force a disperse phase or premix through the membrane, a pressure gradient across the membrane must be imposed, usually by pressurizing the disperse phase with compressed gas in a pressure vessel. The most suitable membrane for emulsification is the so-called Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane.

40|$|For decades, the {{manufacturing}} of solid dosage {{forms in the}} pharmaceutical industry has been synonymous with batch processing. However, batch processes are often sensitive to variability (possibly resulting in batch rejection or reprocessing), high labor costs (due to the multiple manual interventions during processing), high production costs, excessive inventories and scale-up issues. On the other hand, many advantages are associated with continuous processing which are all related to important economic drivers for change (i. e. quality, cost and time). However, implementation of new technologies, methodologies and equipment is needed to allow transfer from batch to continuous manufacturing within the pharmaceutical industry. As wet granulation {{is the most popular}} method to improve material properties (flow, homogeneity, compressibility) prior to tableting, it is obvious that a <b>continuous</b> <b>wet</b> granulation process is of high importance for a manufacturer of solid dosage forms.

The overall objective of this project was {{to bridge the gap between}} the existing technology and its industrial implementation.

The asphalt rubbers were prepared via <b>wet</b> process (<b>continuous</b> blend) and their properties were measured through the current tests: (i) penetration;(ii) softening point: (iii) resilience; (iv) apparent viscosity using a Brookfield viscometer. The rheological properties for conventional asphalts were measured too, {{in order to}} evaluate their mechanical behaviour. The gradation used for the asphalt rubber mixtures was a gap graded (ARHM-GG) specified by Caltrans. ARHM-GG is a surface course with an aggregate gradation that has {{a gap in the}} continuous grading. Using this gradation, from the mix combination of rubber types and conventional asphalts, six asphalt rubbers were made from which resulted six asphalt rubber mixtures. All mixture selected were evaluated through complex modulus al 1 dfatigue test. The results showed that the mixture prepared with crumb rubber from cryogenic process with asphalt binder with higher grade performed better than the other mixtures.

40|$|Quenched {{geometric}} {{disorder of}} a wall delimiting a spectator phase can have dramatic effects {{on the nature of}} critical wetting transitions. We consider selfaffine walls in 2 D with roughness exponent £w. Transfer matrix results for directed interfacial models with short-range interactions suggest that wetting turns firstorder as soon as L,W exceeds £ 0, the anisotropy index of interface fluctuations in the bulk. Discontinuous interface depinning is best identified by a peculiar twopeak structure in the statistical distributions of wall-interface contacts obtained by sampling over disorder. On the other hand, for Cwr<Co <b>wetting</b> remains <b>continuous,</b> most plausibly in the same universality class as with flat walls. This occurs both with ordered (£ 0 = 1 / 2) and with bond-disordered (£ 0 = 2 / 3) bulk. A precise location of the thresholds at {,w = £ 0 can be argued on the basis of an analysis of different terms in the interfacial free energy. This analysis elucidates the peculiar role played by the intrinsic interfacial roughness and suggests extensions of the results to 3 D and to long-range substrate forces.

40|$|Air-cooled {{blast-furnace}} slag {{is commonly}} utilised as a construction material in roads, fill and embankments. Materials used in such constructions do not remain continuously wetted, but is often subjected to cyclic wetting and drying under various exposure conditions. However, its leaching behaviour is often assessed based on tests performed under <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting.</b> This work {{was conducted to}} evaluate the leaching behaviour of an air-cooled blast-furnace slag under intermittent and <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting.</b> Four different leaching tests were performed, including a static leaching test without leachant renewal and three dynamic leaching tests: a column leaching test with continuous flow of the leachant, a tank leaching test with sequential renewal of the leachant and an intermittent leaching test with periodical flow of leachant. Leaching of the studied material under cyclic wetting and drying led to less alkaline and more oxidised eluates than leaching under continuously wetted conditions. The eluates are expected to maintain a mildly alkaline pH for long time periods during wetting, drying and oxidation of the material because the material has considerable acid neutralising potential. The leaching of soluble elements such as Ca and S was lower under intermittent than under continuous flow of the leachant which {{could be due to}} the shorter contact time between the leachant and material, and the precipitation of secondary phases on the particle surfaces during intermittent leaching. During exposure of the BFS to cyclic wetting and drying, the leaching of these elements decreased and the speciation of S in the eluates shifted towards more oxidising forms. The leached amounts of constituents were low in all performed tests, which indicate that the material was resistant to leaching under the conditions that were investigated here.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transition}} zone or contact line between {{a thin film}} and bulk liquid, and calculate the line tension tau, employing an interface displacement model equivalent to Derjaguin's and de Gennes' approach. We investigate the behaviour Of tau in the limit that the contact angle theta tends to zero, approaching a wetting phase transition. Previous results for wetting and prewetting, derived in the gradient-squared approximation of the model, remain valid when the gradient is included to all orders. The interesting singular behaviour Of tau at wetting is universal, due to the critical phenomena that have recently been found to underly first-order as well as <b>continuous</b> <b>wetting</b> transitions. Finally we critically review two contact-line instabilities that {{have been associated with}} contact-angle hysteresis, and propose an alternative physical interpretation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Quantification {{of ammonia}} (NH 3) land-atmosphere {{exchange}} {{is required for}} atmospheric modelling and assessment of nitrogen deposition, yet flux measurement methods remain highly uncertain. To address this issue, a major inter-comparison of ammonia fluxes over intensively managed grassland was conducted during the GRAMINAE Integrated Experiment held in Braunschweig, Germany. In order to provide a robust dataset of ammonia exchange with the vegetation, four independent continuous flux gradient systems were operated. Three independently operated <b>continuous</b> <b>wet</b> denuders systems (AMANDA) were compared with a Wet Effluent Diffusion Denuder (mini-WEDD) system. Measurements were made at two distances from an adjacent livestock farm, allowing effects of advection to be quantified in a real landscape setting. Data treatment included filtering for instrument failure, disturbed wind sectors and unsuitable micrometeorological conditions, with corrections made for storage and advection errors. ...|$|R
