5|$|Mahendra's {{passion for}} cinema {{prompted}} him to leave for India and join the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune in 1966. He had to take up cinematography as he could not gain admissions to other disciplines. At the institute he was exposed to world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, both associated with the French New <b>Wave</b> <b>movement.</b> In 1969, Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Rivette {{made the}} short film Le Coup du Berger, which Truffaut {{credited}} as enacting the New <b>Wave</b> <b>movement.</b> The following year he {{began work on}} his first feature film with the initial support of Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini. Paris Belongs to Us {{was shot in the}} summer of 1958, but not released theatrically until 1961, after Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard had their feature-film debuts distributed and made the New Wave renowned worldwide. After staging a theatrical version of Denis Diderot's novel La Religieuse starring Anna Karina in 1963, Rivette became the editor-in-chief of Cahiers du Cinéma until 1965. He then began production on a film version of La Religieuse, which led to a lengthy public battle with French censorship over the film's release. Finally released in 1967, the publicity made it financially successful.|$|E
5|$|Television's {{debut album}} Marquee Moon, {{released}} in 1977, is frequently {{cited as a}} seminal album in the field. The no <b>wave</b> <b>movement</b> that developed in New York in the late 1970s, with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James Chance, is often treated as the phenomenon's U.S. parallel. The later work of Ohio protopunk pioneers Pere Ubu is also commonly described as post-punk. One {{of the most influential}} American post-punk bands was Boston's Mission of Burma, who brought abrupt rhythmic shifts derived from hardcore into a highly experimental musical context. In 1980, Australia's Boys Next Door moved to London and changed their name to the Birthday Party, which evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Led by the Primitive Calculators, Melbourne's Little Band scene would further explore the possibilities of post-punk. Later alternative rock musicians found diverse inspiration among these post-punk predecessors, as they did among their new wave contemporaries.|$|E

They include stable levitation of an object in water using acoustic standing <b>waves,</b> <b>movement</b> of the object in a plane via radiation force from travelling acoustic <b>waves,</b> <b>movement</b> of the object in three dimensions, use of pulse-echo location to continuously monitor the object's position during levitation, and computer control of the system implementing control algorithms to move the object to a specified point or along a specific path and to provide stable levitation in the presence of perturbations.

5000|$|Movement of {{this fish}} has been {{described}} to look much like crawling, with the first few rays of the dorsal and anal fins moving in a rowing motion that progresses caudally along the fish creating a <b>waving</b> <b>movement</b> of the fins, propelling the fish forward. Flounders are also capable of backwards locomotion, which is achieved with the same <b>waving</b> <b>movement</b> of the fins but the rowing motion progresses anteriorly. This movement {{is used as a}} method of escape or if it encounters an obstacle. [...] When quick movements are needed from this fish, such as when feeding or frightened, the pectoral fin is extended at a right angle from the body, and used as an additional paddle.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the French {{nouvelle}} vague, the Japanese movement initially began {{within the}} studios, albeit with young, and previously little-known filmmakers. The term was first coined within the studios (and in the media) as a Japanese {{version of the}} French New <b>Wave</b> <b>movement.</b> Nonetheless, the Japanese New Wave filmmakers drew {{from some of the}} same international influences that inspired their French colleagues, and as the term stuck, the seemingly artificial movement surrounding it began to rapidly develop into a critical and increasingly independent film movement.|$|E

25|$|Writers {{attempted}} {{to respond to}} the new world in the post-World War I era. In the 1920s and 30s writers entirely unconnected with science fiction were exploring new ways of telling a story and new ways of treating time, space and experience in the narrative form. The posthumously published works of Franz Kafka (who died in 1924) and the works of modernist writers such as James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf and others featured stories in which time and individual identity could be expanded, contracted, looped and otherwise distorted. While this work was unconnected to science fiction as a genre, it did deal with the impact of modernity (technology, science, and change) upon people's lives, and decades later, during the New <b>Wave</b> <b>movement,</b> some modernist literary techniques entered science fiction.|$|E

500|$|Synth-pop (short for {{synthesizer}} pop; {{also called}} techno-pop) is a subgenre of new wave music that first became {{prominent in the}} late 1970s, reached its heyday in the 1980s, and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s {{by the use of}} synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the [...] "Krautrock" [...] of bands like Kraftwerk.

500|$|In the mid-1960s, {{the term}} [...] "New Wave" [...] {{began to be}} applied to the more {{experimental}} work that Moorcock was publishing, and New Worlds was soon regarded as the leading publication in the New <b>Wave</b> <b>movement.</b> [...] In addition to the experimental material, Moorcock attempted to keep the existing readership happy by publishing more traditional science fiction; in the words of sf historian Colin Greenland, he [...] "changed the contents of the magazine much more slowly than he pretended to". [...] Traditional sf stories bought by Moorcock include Vernor Vinge's first story, [...] "Apartness", which appeared in June 1965; he also printed material from Bob Shaw, early stories by Terry Pratchett, and, in March 1965, Arthur C. Clarke's [...] "Sunjammer".|$|E

The result has been alternately ascribed as a work of surrealism, absurdism, the avant garde and included in the Japanese New <b>Wave</b> <b>movement,</b> though not through any stated intention of its director.
