Los tiburones punta blanca de arrecife son habitantes comunes de las aguas que rodean las Islas Galápagos, por lo que muchos de sus sitios de agregación se han convertido en atractivos turísticos. Con el objetivo de describir la fidelidad del sitio y los patrones de residencia de nueve tiburones desde mayo 2008 -septiembre 2009, se utilizó telemetría ultrasónica en un canal de agua salada en el sur de Bahía Academia, Isla Santa Cruz. A pesar de que cuatro tiburones perdieron sus transmisores, los restantes tiburones monitoreados mostraron un uso elevado del interior del canal durante el día y del exterior durante la noche. Sin embargo, ninguno de los tiburones fue detectado en el sitio diariamente, lo cual sugiere que deben tener un número mayor de sitios preferidos dentro de su área de vida...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reef</b> <b>sharks</b> play {{important}} roles in tropical reef environments, but population declines have occurred in various locations including the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). While many <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> studies focus on coral <b>reefs,</b> some <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> have been found {{across a range of}} inshore and coastal habitats. This study analyses fisheries observer data across large spatial scales (19314 km²) to investigate the occurrence of <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> amongst a mosaic of inshore habitats in the GBR lagoon. Six <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> species were recorded, but comprised a relatively small proportion (1. 8 % by number) of the elasmobranch catch. The blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> dominated the catch of <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> (60. 2 % by number), with lemon sharks, zebra sharks, grey carpet <b>sharks,</b> whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> and grey <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> less frequently encountered. <b>Reef</b> <b>sharks</b> occur in several habitat types, and logistic regression models suggest that they are most likely to occur in reef habitats and shallow shore habitats. The presence of a reef within 2 km increased the encounter probability in all habitat types. While the use of these different habitats by <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> is not well understood, these habitat use patterns affect the exposure of these species to risks, including some risk factors not considered previously, and could also lead to cumulative impacts. These habitats may also perform important ecological functions in sustaining <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> populations. Habitat use patterns should be considered in risk assessments and management and have important implications for method selection and survey design in field studies of <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> and other mobile reef species...|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (Triaenodon obesus), the grey <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> {{is one of}} the three most common <b>sharks</b> inhabiting Indo-Pacific <b>reefs.</b> They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|R
2500|$|The blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> is {{typically}} about [...] long. It is usually found over reef ledges and sandy flats, {{though it can}} also enter brackish and freshwater environments. This species likes shallow water, while the whitetip and the grey <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> are prefer deeper water. Younger sharks favour shallow sandy flats, and older sharks spend more time around reef ledges and near reef drop-offs. Blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> are strongly attached to their own area, where they may remain for up to several years. A tracking study off Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific {{has found that the}} blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> had a home range of about , among the smallest of any shark species. The size and location of the range does not change with time of day. The blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> may be encountered alone or in small groups. Large social aggregations have also been observed. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and also feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> are preyed on by groupers, grey <b>reef</b> <b>sharks,</b> tiger sharks, and members of their own species. At Palmyra Atoll, adult blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> avoid patrolling tiger sharks by staying out of the central, deeper lagoon.|$|R

The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> nor the outer reef like the grey <b>reef</b> <b>shark.</b> The whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|R

5|$|Subsequent authors {{moved the}} blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{designated}} {{it as the}} type species for the genus.

40|$|<b>Reef</b> <b>sharks</b> (fam. Carcharhinidae) are {{high-order}} predators, {{found throughout}} the Indo- Pacific.

Underwater visual census protocols were successfully developed, and provided realtime, fisheries-independent estimates of reef carcharhinid abundances. Visual censusing of a minimally-exploited reef system ascertained that reef crest was the preferred habitat of T. obesus and C. amblyrhynchos, while the blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus) was more abundant in reef flat and lagoon habitats.

25|$|Grey <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are usually}} less than 1.9 metres (6.2ft) long. Despite their {{moderate}} size, grey <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> actively expel most other shark species from favored habitats. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> the latter species occupy the shallow flats while the grey <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> stay in deeper water. Many grey <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> {{have a home}} range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of 5–20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. They are found over continental and insular shelves, preferring the leeward (away {{from the direction of}} the current) sides of coral reefs with clear water and rugged topography. They are frequently found near the drop-offs at the outer edges of the reef, and less commonly within lagoons. On occasion, this shark may venture several kilometers out into the open ocean.|$|R
500|$|Important predators of the whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> include tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis), and {{possibly}} also silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), though they usually occur at depths {{greater than those}} favored by whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>sharks.</b> An [...] long whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> has also {{been found in the}} stomach of a giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus), though these groupers are unlikely to be significant predators of this species due to their rarity. Known parasites of the whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> include the copepod Paralebion elongatus and the praniza (parasitic) larvae of the isopod Gnathia grandilaris. While resting during the day, these sharks have been observed being cleaned by the wrasse Bodianus diplotaenia and the goby Elacatinus puncticulatus. Unusually, there is also a report of seven whitetip <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> adopting a cleaning posture (mouth agape and gills flared) {{in the midst of a}} swarm of non-cleaning hyperiid amphipods; the mechanical stimulation from the moving amphipods are thought to have evoked this behavior through their similarity to actual cleaner organisms.|$|R
