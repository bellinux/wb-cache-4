5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> representatives in the upper house {{would be the same}} for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal.

5|$|In March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court {{ruled that}} the land invasions were illegal; they {{nevertheless}} continued, and Mugabe began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary. After the Supreme Court also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully pressuring chief justice Anthony Gubbay to do so. ZANU-PF member Godfrey Chidyausiku was appointed to replace him, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Supreme Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-Mugabe figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal. In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. <b>While</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E
5|$|On {{the whole}} Australian {{commerce}} was expanded {{due to the}} war, although {{the cost of the}} war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. This was due in the most part to the reduced ability of traditional sources to continue supplying Australia with manufactured products, which out of necessity stimulated the development of the Australian manufacturing industry.|$|E

The number of households containing three or more adults increased by 11 per cent.

5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the mandate created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> full-time jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much {{more than in the}} private sector. A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E

The plot of the series follows three couples: Adam (James Nesbitt) and Rachel (Helen Baxendale) getting to grips with bringing up baby Matthew (born in the final episode of the previous series), the return of Pete (John Thomson) and Jo (Kimberley Joseph) from their honeymoon, and the subsequent breakdown of their marriage, and the divorce proceedings between Karen (Hermione Norris) and David (Robert Bathurst).|$|E

The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven of these storms attained hurricane status, three of them becoming major hurricanes. There were fewer tropical storms than the average of 16, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hurricanes and major hurricanes were slightly below average.

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> license holders {{started to}} rise gradually, firearm sales rose even faster in 2015, mostly {{prompted}} by the EU efforts to restrict law abiding citizens' access to firearms.

Local tendencies generally follow the nationwide trend, however any worsening of security in any given district is often followed by a sharp rise in gun ownership therein. For example, in 2011, after a wave of racially motivated attacks by Romani perpetrators against majority population victims, there was a rise of gun ownership in Šluknov Hook area.|$|E

The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies' universal appeal—through mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon {{be little more than}} a memory.

5|$|From 1969 to 1973, it {{used oil}} {{money to fund}} social welfare programs, which led to house-building {{projects}} and improved healthcare and education. House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate homelessness and to replace the shanty towns created by Libya's growing urbanization. The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50% more hospitals than it had in 1968, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> doctors had grown from 700 to over 3000 in that decade. Malaria was eradicated, and trachoma and tuberculosis greatly curtailed. Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced. Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded. In doing so the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education system. Through these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands. These early social programs proved popular within Libya. This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi's personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, {{as well as his}} rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter Omar Mukhtar.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women.
