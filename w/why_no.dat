5|$|This basin’s {{season has}} a double peak: one in April and May, before {{the onset of}} the monsoon, and another in October and November, just after. This double peak occurs because {{powerful}} vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones. High shear explains <b>why</b> <b>no</b> cyclones can form in the Red Sea, which possesses the necessary depth, vorticity and surface temperatures year-round. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.|$|E

25|$|An axlotl tank is {{essentially}} a brain-dead woman whose womb {{is used as a}} tank to create gholas. The Bene Tleilax's use of their women in this capacity explains <b>why</b> <b>no</b> one has ever seen a Tleilaxu female.|$|E
25|$|Whether he won many {{continuing}} disciples {{on these}} hazardous Tibetan treks is not known.

25|$|The labor {{history of}} the United States {{describes}} the history of organized labor, US labor law, and more general history of working people, in the United States. Beginning in the 1930s, unions became important components of the Democratic Party. However, some historians have not understood <b>why</b> <b>no</b> Labor Party emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} why these four were buried {{next to the}} {{memorial}} and not elsewhere in the Confederate section. Ezekiel, Wright, and Hickey all played major roles in creating the Confederate section and bringing the memorial into being, but it is less clear why Marmaduke warranted burial {{at the foot of}} the memorial (although his notable war service may have justified it). Also unclear is <b>why</b> <b>no</b> other notable burials occurred next to the memorial.|$|E
25|$|An {{interior}} vortex of {{this type}} would explain <b>why</b> <b>no</b> frequency jumps occur. Since the excess fluid in the cavity must be discharged, the jet lateral movement must be considerably larger than that found in the edge tone; this is likely {{the reason for the}} high level sound. The flow over the edge results in an applied force and a dipole-like sound field. The characteristic speed must be U the jet exit speed. The characteristic dimension must be D, the cavity diameter.|$|E
25|$|A {{board of}} inquiry {{was set up}} to {{investigate}} the crash. It concluded 'the most probable cause of the crash was a criminal act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft'. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which would explain <b>why</b> <b>no</b> Mayday signal was given. There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A flight recorder (black box) was not located after the crash and previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed.|$|E

25|$|Cosmic {{inflation}} is a faster-than-light expansion of space {{just after the}} Big Bang. It explains {{the origin of the}} large-scale structure of the cosmos. It is believed quantum vacuum fluctuations caused by zero-point energy arising in the microscopic inflationary period, later became magnified to a cosmic size, becoming the gravitational seeds for galaxies and structure in the Universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation). Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the Universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the Universe is flat, and <b>why</b> <b>no</b> magnetic monopoles have been observed.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{extremely}} rare p-p IV branch. Other even-rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or {{because the number of}} reacting particles is so low that any reactions that might happen are statistically insignificant. This is partly <b>why</b> <b>no</b> mass-5 or mass-8 elements are seen. While the reactions that would produce them, such as a proton + helium-4 producing lithium-5, or two helium-4 nuclei coming together to form beryllium-8, may actually happen, these elements are not detected because there are no stable isotopes of atomic masses 5 or 8; the resulting products immediately decay into their initial reactants.|$|E
25|$|Although {{thorough}} {{training and}} practice {{are required to}} use Cangjie, many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast typing speed availed by the input method. This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact, unambiguous Chinese character which the user has in mind to input, pinpointing to only one character in most cases. This is also the reason <b>why</b> <b>no</b> provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this Input Method. The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows. On Mac OS X, handwriting recognition input method is bundled with the OS.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, on April 5, a {{northbound}} train {{ran through}} a wildfire on the Isleta Pueblo reservation.

On the evening of August 24, a southbound train hit a vehicle at a private grade crossing south of Los Lunas. Two people in the vehicle were killed. No one aboard the train was injured. It appears that the Rail Runner personnel followed procedure. On the evening of September 19, a southbound train hit a vehicle at a private grade crossing between Belen and Los Lunas. One person in the vehicle was killed.|$|E
25|$|At a Gupta family wedding held at Sun City in 2013, various {{incidents}} of racism occurred. The family {{made clear that}} they wanted only white workers, including waiters, security, bar staff and cleaning staff. Black workers were told to wash before they interacted with guests. These allegations were denied by the Gupta family. Nonetheless, in the Gupta e-mail leak of 2017 these allegations were shown to be correct. Moreover, the e-mails also make clear that a black worker was called a monkey {{by a member of}} the Gupta family. That the Gupta family is a large, vocal and powerful supporter of the ANC and a personal friend of Jacob Zuma, may explain <b>why</b> <b>no</b> action was taken against them with regards to racism.|$|E

25|$|Nationwide, Ivo Josipović {{obtained}} 32% and Milan Bandić 14%, {{meaning the}} two of them combined achieved less support than Stjepan Mesić did in 2005 in the first round only. The fact that there were only three actual left-leaning candidates meant the left was relatively united under Josipović, while the votes of the right were spread out on several prominent candidates, including Bandić, {{which was one of the}} reasons <b>why</b> <b>no</b> right wing candidate managed to qualify for a run-off. As such, this election became historic as a run-off would feature two candidates once in the same party, Josipović, who rejoined SDP a year before the election, and Bandić, who left SDP a month before the election so he could run as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Neighbours {{had assumed}} the flat was unoccupied, and the odour of decomposing body tissue was {{attributed}} to nearby waste bins. The flat's windows did not allow direct sight into the accommodation. Drug addicts frequented the area, which may explain <b>why</b> <b>no</b> one questioned the constant noise from the television. Half of her rent was being automatically paid to Metropolitan Housing Trust by benefits agencies, leading officials {{to believe that she}} was still alive. However, over two years, £2,400 in unpaid rent accrued, and housing officials decided to repossess the property. Her corpse was discovered on 25 January 2006 when the bailiffs broke in. The television and heating were still running due to her bills being continually paid for by automatic debit payments and debt forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|FERC's {{investigation}} of energy market manipulations {{led to a}} subsequent investigation into possible obstruction of justice by employees of JPMorgan Chase. Various newspapers reported in September 2013 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Attorney's Office in Manhattan were investigating whether employees withheld information or made false statements during the FERC investigation. The reported impetus for the investigation was a letter from Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, in which they asked FERC <b>why</b> <b>no</b> action was taken against people who impeded the FERC investigation. At {{the time of the}} FBI investigation, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was also looking into whether JPMorgan Chase employees impeded the FERC investigation. Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase was facing over a dozen investigations at the time.|$|E

50|$|Celebrated {{twentieth century}} playwright Eugène Ionesco said that Wilson “surpassed Beckett” because “Wilson's silence is a silence that speaks”.
