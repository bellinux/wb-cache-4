5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|The Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings {{are used}} to {{determine}} the qualification of the players for the tournament. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, each singles tournament had 38 competitors, while each doubles tournament had 16 pairs. All players or pairs from the top 16 places on the BWF rankings automatically qualify, although each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can send less than three players or pairs in each tournament. The top 64 then qualify with the caveat that each NOC can send only two players/pairs from that portion of the list. Players and pairs ranked below the 64th place only qualify if they are the highest-ranked competitor from their nation. Two places each in the men's and women's singles <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tripartite Commission. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives at least either two singles players or one pair. The rules used in the tournament are the same as the BWF rules.|$|E

The best {{bounding}} volume <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> {{the shape of the}} underlying object or objects. For example, if the objects are long and thin then a sphere will enclose mainly empty space and a box is much better. Boxes are also easier for hierarchical bounding volumes.|$|E
25|$|The quarterfinal matchups <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the regulation-round {{record of}} the six playoff teams aside from the two {{automatically}} qualified hosts Slovan Bratislava and Vienna Capitals.

25|$|Each {{match in}} the {{knockout}} stage must conclude in a victory. If, after eighty minutes of normal play, a match {{results in a}} draw, further play is made to determine an outright winner. Initially, {{there will be two}} periods of extra time, 10 minutes each way; if there is no winner after this, then play proceeds to a single 10-minute period of 'sudden death' play. If the contest is unresolved after a total 110 minutes of open play, the winner <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> a placekicking competition.|$|E

40|$|Anscombe {{is usually}} {{seen as a}} critic of “Modern Moral Philosophy. ” I attempt a {{systematic}} reconstruction and a defense of Anscombe’s positive theory. Anscombe’s metaethics is a hybrid of social constructivism and Aristotelian naturalism. Her three main claims are the following: (1) We cannot trace all duties back to one moral principle; {{there is more than}} one source of normativity. (2) Whether I have a certain duty <b>will</b> often <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the social practices of my community. For instance, duties imposed by other people’s rights are socially constructed. (3) Whether something constitutes a good, however, <b>will</b> often <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> human nature—which <b>is</b> not socially constructed...|$|R
25|$|Similarly, in the {{quantification}} of damages generally {{and/or the}} partitioning of damages between {{two or more}} defendants, {{the extent of the}} liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not {{have had the opportunity to}} make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{expedite}} social, economic, development, public health, cultural, and educational programmes and facilitate other affairs relating to public welfare {{with the cooperation}} of the people according to local needs, the administration of each village, division, city, municipality, and province will be supervised by a council to be named the Village, Division, City, Municipality, or Provincial Council. Members of each of these councils will be elected by the people of the locality in question. Qualifications for the eligibility of electors and candidates for these councils, as well as their functions and powers, the mode of election, the jurisdiction of these councils, the hierarchy of their authority, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> law, {{in such a way as}} to preserve national unity, territorial integrity, the system of the Islamic Republic, and the sovereignty of the central government.|$|E
25|$|Heating {{an ideal}} mixture of two {{volatile}} substances A and B (with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point) in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus {{depicted in the}} opening figure) {{until the mixture is}} boiling results in a vapor above the liquid which contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid: the ratio in the liquid <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This in turn means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than the starting liquid).|$|E

25|$|In October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec {{passed a}} new zero {{emission}} vehicle legislation that obliges any carmaker who sells in the Canadian province more than 4,500 new vehicles per year {{over a three-year}} average, to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% {{of the total number}} of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles (ZEV) starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A tradable credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. The quotas <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> Quebec's Ministry of Sustainable Development. Quebec became the first Canadian province to pass such legislation, joining ten U.S. states, including California, that have similar ZEV laws. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020. Initially, the provincial government set the goal in 2011 to have 300,000 plug-in vehicles on the roads by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Once a year, {{teams can}} use a mid-level {{exception}} (MLE) to sign a player to a contract for a specified maximum amount. The amount of the MLE and its duration depend on the team's cap status. In the 2017 CBA, the MLE was initially set at $8.406 million in the 2017–18 season for teams that are over the cap either {{before or after the}} signing, but under the luxury tax apron, set at $6 million above the tax line. Teams can use this exception to offer contracts of up to four years. Teams above the apron have an MLE initially set at $5.192 million, allowing contracts of up to three years. Teams with cap room, which were ineligible for the MLE before the 2011 CBA, have an MLE initially set at $4.328 million that allows two-year contracts. In subsequent seasons, all MLE amounts <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> applying the percentage change of the salary cap to the previous exception amount.|$|E
