Its tangy taste is attributable to being infused with the wild herbs on which the animals pasture. Robiola {{can also be used}} in cooking including famous Piemonte dishes such as [...] "risotto robiola" [...] and [...] "aglio robiola spaghetti" [...] and other dishes. Special care should be exercised in properly storing the cheese (do not <b>wrap</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic,</b> as the cheese can [...] "choke" [...] and spoil). Best stored refrigerated unwrapped in its crust, or wrapped in paper. Best used within a week of purchase.|$|E
