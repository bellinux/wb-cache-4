40|$|Sensitivity {{to water}} {{condition}} during germination {{is an important}} character in malting barley because it affects malt poduction. <b>Water</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in malting barley {{is defined as the}} defference in germination percentage between the seeds in standard and excess-water conditions. Usually standard and excess-water condition means 4 and 8 ml water in a 90 mm perti dish, respectively. Takeda and Fukuyama (1983) examined more than 4, 000 barley accessions and found 0 ～ 100 % <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This means complete to no suppression of germination by an excess-water condition. In this study, quantiative trait loci (QTL) analysis was applied to analize the inheritance of <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Two sets of doubled haploid (DH) populations derived from Steptoe×Morex (S/M) and Harrington×TR 306 (H/T) crosses,were grown in the experiment field of the Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University. Bulbosum method was adapted to develop DH lines (Chen and Hayes 1989). Water sensitivities of 150 (S/M) and (H/T) lines and their parents were evaluated using 50 seeds each and the germination test (25 ℃, 4 days) was repeated four times. <b>Water</b> <b>sensitivity</b> showed a large variation (Fig. 1) and the heritability of the trait was 0. 78 and 0. 72 in S/M and H/T, respectively, indicating that about three-quarters of the phenotypic variance was genetic in origin. Three (S/M) and one (H/T) significant QTL were detected and 23 % (S/M) and 25 % (H/T) of the phenotypic variance was explained by the QTL.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The Environmental Conditioning System (ECS) was {{designed}} to evaluate the <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of asphalt concrete mixtures. The ECS subjects asphalt concrete specimens {{to a series of}} conditioning cycles including water flow, elevated and/or lowered temperature, and repeated axial loading. The purpose of this research was to: (1) evaluate the ECS test apparatus and procedure, and (2) determine whether the ECS can identify asphalt concrete mixtures that will perform well, or poorly, in the field with regard to <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Twelve primary field test sections were identified. For each section, specimens were prepared in the laboratory using the original mix design (or the mix design identified by extraction), and the original aggregates, asphalts, and admixtures. Specimens were tested using two procedures: the ECS and the Oregon State University (OSU) wheel tracker. Field cores were used to evaluate in-situ mixture performance. Nine additional mixtures that have historically experienced water damage were tested in a limited secondary test program. Analyses were performed to determine the mixture properties that were significant in the prediction of mixture performance in the ECS. Mixture type was consistently the most significant predictor of ECS modulus ratio (change in mixture stiffness), degree of visual stripping, and binder migration, which were the performance indicators for <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity</b> evaluated in the ECS. Additional analysis indicated the existence of correlations among the ECS response variables. Significant correlations were found between the coefficient of water permeability and the degree of visual stripping; and between specimen deformation and the degree of visual stripping and binder migration. Mixture performance was compared between the ECS and the OSU wheel tracker and the field. Results indicate that the ECS test procedure can distinguish the relative performance of mixtures, with regard to <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and mixture performance in the ECS correlates well with performance in the OSU wheel tracker. No correlation was found between mixture performance in the ECS and mixture performance in the field for the primary test sections. However, the primary field sections are relatively young, and water damage is expected to manifest itself in the future in those pavements identified as water sensitive by the ECS.

40|$|International audienceAn acid <b>waters</b> <b>sensitivity</b> map {{has been}} widely used as a {{background}} resource for assessing potential impacts of forest management on stream water acidity within Wales. The validity of this approach has been explored by comparing predicted acid sensitivity with the observed acid neutralisation capacity (ANC) in stream runoff using data sets from two regional surveys of a major area of acidification concern in Wales. For catchments in excess of 20 ha, the acid sensitivity predictions are generally upheld, although biologically important extremes of acidity are not predicted. For smaller catchments of 2 to 5 ha area, the large observed variations in ANC are poorly predicted from the acid sensitivity map; there is no statistically significant relationship between predicted sensitivity and measured baseflow and stormflow ANC values for the catchments. This reflects {{the high degree of}} heterogeneity within catchments and the complexity of soil and groundwater interactions. The maps offer a starting point for assessing sensitivity. However, they provide no more than a very crude indication at the scale of interest to forestry managers.

Hierarchical cluster {{analysis was used}} to split unimpacted sites into four homogenous river types based on species composition and geographical location. Classification trees were employed to predict associated river types for impacted sites with four environmental variables. We defined a set of 129 candidate fish metrics to select the best reacting metrics for each river type. The candidate metrics represented tolerances/intolerances of species associated with six metric types: habitat, migration, <b>water</b> quality <b>sensitivity,</b> reproduction, trophic level and biodiversity. The results showed that 17 uncorrelated metrics reacted to pressures in the four river types.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Asphalt {{concrete}} pavement {{is subjected to}} several damaging actions from traffic loads, water (from precipitation and/or groundwater sources), and temperature. The durability of the asphalt-aggregate mixture, its ability to withstand these damaging actions for long periods, {{is a very important}} engineering property. While the durability of the asphalt-aggregates mixture depends on several factors such as the mixture's properties, construction methods, traffic loads and environmental conditions, they have to be evaluated to predict their field performance. Based on mixture evaluations, the mixtures that fail the test would have to be modified by additives or by changing the materials. The first objective of this thesis was to evaluate asphalt-aggregate mixtures for water damage using the Environmental Conditioning System (ECS), and rank the asphalt and aggregate types based on <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The second objective was to relate the ECS ranking of the asphalt and aggregate types to Oregon State University (OSU) and University of Nottingham, UK (SWK/UN) wheel tracking test results, and to Net Adsorption Test (NAT) results. The third objective was to evaluate open-graded mixtures and rubber modified mixtures for <b>water</b> <b>sensitivity</b> using the ECS. The ECS test results indicate that performance ranking of mixtures by asphalt type or aggregate type alone cannot be made for the ECS test results due to the significant interaction between asphalt and aggregate. <b>Water</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the ECS is significant for combinations of asphalt and aggregate. The ECS test results have shown that ECS performance ranking after one cycle is not statistically significant and does not correlate with ranking after three cycles. The results show that the ECS test program has similar aggregate rankings to those of the NAT and SWK/UN test program, while good agreement exists between SWK/UN wheel tracking results and the NAT test program results. However, poor agreement exists between the OSU wheel tracking results and those of the other two tests. Poor or very little agreement exists among the wheel tracking test results, ECS, and NAT test results in terms of asphalt type rankings.

This holds out new possibilities for use of polymer-modified mixtures, especially in developing countries, because it widens the possibility of using locally available bitumen, of variable quality, for producing mixtures with higher performance.

Because of low price of irrigation <b>water</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> of corn crop to water deficit, the optimum depths of water were 76. 8 and 73. 4 cm under land and water limitations, respectively. Therefore, under limited water conditions, only 4. 7 percent of the full irrigation water (maximum corn grain production) can be saved for maximum profits...|$|R
