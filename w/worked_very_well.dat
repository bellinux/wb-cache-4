5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E

25|$|Conspicuous leisure, or the {{non-productive}} use of {{time for}} the sake of displaying social status, is used by Veblen as the primary indicator of the leisure class. To engage in conspicuous leisure is to openly display one's wealth and status, as productive work signified the absence of pecuniary strength and was seen as a mark of weakness. As the leisure class increased their exemption from productive work, that very exemption became honorific and actual participation in productive work became a sign of inferiority. Conspicuous leisure <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> to designate social status in rural areas, but urbanization made it so that conspicuous leisure was no longer a sufficient means to display pecuniary strength. Urban life requires more obvious displays of status, wealth, and power, which is where conspicuous consumption becomes prominent.|$|E
25|$|Fowler’s {{modified}} ploughing {{system was}} demonstrated at the Royal Agricultural Society of England meeting at Chelmsford in 1856. {{and at the}} following meeting at Salisbury in 1857. In 1854 the R.A.S.E. had offered a £200 prize for the best system of mechanical cultivation, and this had since been raised to £500. At Chelmsford, Fowler’s ploughing system was pitted against a rival ploughing system designed by John Smith of Woolston. Smith’s design did not fulfil all of the judges’ conditions and it was disqualified. Fowler’s system <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> but the estimated cost of his work was 7s 2½d per acre as against 7s for horse ploughing. The judges therefore decided not to award the prize, a bitter disappointment for Fowler who thought that the superior speed of his system over horse ploughing should have been taken into account.|$|E

500|$|After {{the death}} in 1817 of Thomas Wyon Sr, {{the father of}} the man who had adapted Pistrucci's designs, Pole most {{probably}} offered Pistrucci the post of chief engraver at the Royal Mint, with a salary of £500 per annum. and a house within the grounds of the Mint. However, it soon appeared that a law passed under William III barred foreigners from the post, and so Pole left it vacant, while granting Pistrucci the salary and emoluments of the office. Sir John Craig wrote in his history of the Royal Mint: [...] "The arrangement was not put into writing, and misunderstanding was easy for a foreigner. Pole categorically denied any commitment beyond the grant for the time being of a salary for coinage designs as cheaper than payment of fees. The Italian persistently contended that he was seduced into Mint service by a promise of formal appointment to the chief engravership". According to H.W.A. Linecar in his book on British coin designs and designers, [...] "the arrangement might have <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> even though it was against accepted procedure, had Pistrucci been other than he was." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared to the {{graphical}} changes, {{the artificial}} intelligence (AI) of the computer-controlled characters {{was only slightly}} changed. The justification given was that the team felt the AI <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> for the first game. All {{they had to do}} was to tweak it a little and fix some bugs. There was, however, a lot of work done in improving the multiplayer portion of the game. For FreeSpace 2, the player's personal computer was assigned a greater role in predicting the possible consequences for other players' actions. This reduced the amount of data needed to be transferred between the computers, which would result in a smoother playing experience. Beta testers were recruited to stress test and troubleshoot the multiplayer mode as well. SquadWar was implemented as an attempt to establish a sense of continuity among the players in the form of a persistent online territorial fight, along with pilot statistics and ladder rankings. Volition hoped this concept would help to establish a strong, online community and build up the game's lifespan. The process of fixing the bugs detected was even publicly published on the game's official website as the [...] "Bug Fix of the Day" [...] feature.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II in March 1945, Chang {{arrived at}} the {{recently}} founded Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, just outside Worcester on a fellowship granted to him by Gregory Pincus to learn the technique of in vitro fertilisation.

[...] It was also at the foundation that Chang's work which contributed to the development of the oral contraceptive made him one of the co-founders of the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the incline}} {{did not work}} well. [...] In 1884, the company {{chairman}} reported to shareholders that [...] "one of the greatest difficulties that had had to be overcome in working the mine had been the task of finding a competent mechanical engineer to work the incline." [...] A new engineer, Henry Hughes, was engaged {{at the end of}} 1883 and the whole system remodelled. George Binns, an Inspector of Mines, had suggested in 1883 that an ordinary endless rope system would be better than the system then being tried for lowering coal on the incline. Mr Hughes adopted this idea and altered the system into five self-acting inclines, each with an endless rope. In 1884, George Binns reported that the new inclines <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> but noted it was necessary to stop each incline every time a tub (truck) passed the incline terminus, causing considerable delays. He expected this would soon be resolved.|$|E

2500|$|Washington Post {{architectural}} critic Benjamin Forgey {{was more}} equivocal. [...] He called the structure [...] "pop architecture [...] is proudly idiosyncratic", {{arguing that it}} failed {{as a piece of}} consistent architecture but succeeded in creating a unique and popular space. The overall impression, Forgey argued, was of disunity, although some elements (notably the rooftop chimneys and cupolas and the southwestern corner and western facade) <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> together. Forgey had strong praise, however, for Thomas Jefferson Promenade and the strong sense of movement and vitality it created. Taken by itself, he said, the light tower in the fountain was also [...] "the right object in the right place" [...] and powerfully defined the elliptical plaza/fountain space. Even so, he found, its clean design didn't fit well with the [...] "busyness" [...] around it. Two years after the project opened, Forgey maintained his opinion that Washington Harbour was a [...] "giant, busy architectural egg", but one [...] "redeemed mightily by its fine urban design".|$|E

[...] Shocklee's sentiments were reinforced by Chuck D while explaining the group's working methods during production. [...] "Eric was the musician, Hank was the antimusician. Eric did a lot of the [...] programming, [...] Keith was the guy who would bring in the feel." [...] For his contributions to the production side, Chuck stated that he [...] "would scour for vocal samples all over the Earth. I would name a song, tag it, and get the vocal samples." [...] Chuck D also noted the productiveness of Sadler and Shocklee's differing approaches to the creative process.

He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand [...] "like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials." [...] Mermeule noted that [...] "the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello" [...] and that [...] "the coin {{as a whole is}} a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted." [...] The author concluded of Aitken's works, [...] "his imagination in selecting from the past to rephrase the present <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in the United States commemorative coinage".|$|E

2500|$|The Democrats won easy {{landslide}} {{victories in}} 1932 and 1934, {{and an even}} bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholic, Jewish, and black people. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' political machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including [...] taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt {{to win the presidency}} in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him. [...] The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, Tammany Hall in Manhattan. There he supported the complicated coalition built around the nominal Republican Fiorello La Guardia, [...] and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.|$|E
