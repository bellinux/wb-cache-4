500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} released by Bulk Recordings on May 7, 1996, under the shorter title Dr. Octagon. Although the album sold relatively well, Nakamura {{has said it}} was under-promoted because it was released by an independent label. In both the United States and United Kingdom, the album was issued by Bulk Records on vinyl as a double LP, and on compact disc with bonus tracks,. Separately, it was also issued by Mo' Wax in the UK as a triple LP, reflecting the track listing of the Bulk Recordings compact disk. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> record we {{thought of it as}} an underground joint", Nakamura said.|$|E
500|$|Crewmen aboard Minas Geraes began {{planning}} for a revolt years before 1910, according to João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor who would later become {{the leader of the}} Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of beriberi. Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to Newcastle in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they [...] "maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships. Almost two years paid by the Brazilian government, we sent messengers to sound out the situation here [...] <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> so that when we arrive, we would be prepared to act"—they were just [...] "waiting for a date and for power," [...] referring to the brand-new warships.|$|E
500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here. That’s what it takes to run at this level, {{to be a part of}} that Chase, if we can go and continue to have as much fun as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> weekend.

I think what bothered me most was that the question was 'why did she stay' and not 'why did he hit her'. And <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> across the board with violent situations, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> with domestic violence by asking ‘why did she stay?’ and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> with rape by saying 'why did she wear that?' as if your clothing or your mere presence gives someone the right to hurt you." ...|$|R

He said: [...] "There {{has been a lot of}} discussion about it: 'Is this the last Iron Man for Robert ?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [...] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth." [...] In April 2013, Cheadle stated that Iron Man 3 could be the final film in the series, saying, [...] "The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. I know there was talk of making sure <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway." [...] In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, [...] "There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth Iron Man." [...] Despite this, in April 2016, Downey stated that he was open to reprising his role in a potential fourth Iron Man film, saying [...] "I feel like I could do one more." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> season.|$|E
500|$|Anglin {{asserts that}} the purpose of The Daily Stormer is to provide [...] "a means to propagandize people … to get them to look at the world in a certain way". Headlines include [...] "All Intelligent People in History Disliked Jews", and [...] "Adolf Hitler: The Most Lied About Man of All Time". The site bills itself as [...] "America's #1 Most-Trusted Republican News Source". According to The Jewish Chronicle, The Daily Stormer [...] "posts {{hundreds}} of racist articles targeting black people, Arabs and Jews". The website offers pro-separatist coverage of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which Anglin considers [...] "the correct moral position". The SPLC described the site as [...] "the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web", which [...] "has {{in the last six months}} [...] often topped the oldest and largest hate site on the web, Stormfront, in terms of reach and page views, based on Alexa data". Anglin claimed in May 2016 that the website's traffic had doubled over the last six months, peaking at 120,000 daily visitors. The website is part of the alt-right movement, and it calls itself [...] "The World’s Most Visited Alt-Right Website". As the movement made headlines in mid-2016, [...] "bolstered in part by the unexpected rise of Donald Trump and Britain's decision to leave the European Union", Anglin declared: [...] "We won the meme war; now we've taken over the GOP, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> very, very quickly." [...] Unlike other figures such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Anglin does not play down the extremist elements in the alt-right, stating that: [...] "The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, President Tong said he {{believed}} the PRC {{was still trying to}} exert influence over his country.
