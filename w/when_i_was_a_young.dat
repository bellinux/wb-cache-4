25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E

Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand {{what they were talking}} about at the time... They were raw and did their own thing, and I loved that. I love artists who don't conform to what people expect of them".|$|E

To be commissioned in the Navy, you had to be appointed by the President with the approval of Congress. This is the procedure and requirement for the seating of a Supreme Court judge or an ambassador. This is why a naval officer must have his chin out at all times." [...] Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a lieutenant commander in BuPers from 1953–1955, remembered Holloway as [...] "the superior who most impressed me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> officer." ...|$|E
