5|$|The Agreement on the Conservation of Seals in the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> {{enforced}} in 1991, {{prohibits the}} killing or harassment of seals in the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> specifically targeting the harbor seal population.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) is {{the only}} global {{organization}} that conserves {{a broad range of}} animals, of which includes marine mammals. Of the agreements made, three of them deal with the conservation of marine mammals: ACCOBAMS, ASCOBANS, and the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> Agreement. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) adopted a pollution prevention approach to conservation, which many other conventions at the time also adopted.|$|E
5|$|The 16 {{national}} parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park. In addition, there are 15 Biosphere Reserves, {{as well as}} 98 nature parks. More than 400 registered zoos and animal parks operate in Germany, which {{is believed to be}} the largest number in any country. The Berlin Zoo, opened in 1844, is the oldest zoo in Germany, and presents the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.|$|E
5|$|Some recolonizing {{habitats}} are confirmed, {{especially in}} the North and South Atlantic (e.g. English and Irish coasts, English Channel) to coasts in the north such as the North Sea and <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> where the first confirmed sighting since 1755 was made in 2003, South Pacific (e.g. New Zealand coasts and Niue), pelagic islands of Chile such as Isla Salas y Gómez and Easter Island, where possibilities of undocumented wintering grounds have been considered, southern fiords of Chile and Peru (e.g. Gulf of Penas, Strait of Magellan, Beagle Channel) and in Asia. Areas in the Philippines such as the Babuyan Islands, Cagayan (the first modern mortality of the species in the nation was in 2007), Calayan and Pasaleng Bay, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands in Japan and the Northern Mariana Islands recently again became stable/growing wintering grounds while the Marshall Islands, Vietnamese, Taiwanese and Chinese coasts show slow or no obvious recovery.|$|E

25|$|From {{the harbor}} of Büsum, {{tourists}} can take trips to sea, either for pleasure or fishing, as nature trips along the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> National Parks, {{or to the}} island Helgoland.|$|E
25|$|Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands {{also have}} a trilateral {{agreement}} {{for the protection of}} the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> or mudflats, which run along the coasts of the three countries on the southern edge of the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|Büsum is also {{seat of a}} {{park ranger}} station and museum of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> National Parks {{offering}} guided tours and information on nature conservation efforts. The Museum am Meer at the harbor offers insights into Büsum's past and present history in fishing and tourism.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{and wild}} animals on Amrum {{are marked by}} the {{proximity}} to the sea, but some also distinguish themselves by extreme rarity and a high ecological value worth of protection. This fact was acknowledged by the establishment of two nature reserves and Amrum's proximity to the Schleswig-Holstein <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> National Park.|$|E
25|$|Since 1818, Büsum {{has been}} used as a spa town visited for the healing effects of the {{seawater}} and the mudflats of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea.</b> It gained official Nordseebad (North Sea spa) status in 1837. To accommodate spa guests, Büsum was connected to the railway network by the Heide–Büsum railway in 1883.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} part of the state, the {{lowlands}} have virtually no hills. The North Frisian Islands, as well as almost all of Schleswig-Holstein's North Sea coast, form the Schleswig-Holstein <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> National Park (Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer) which is the largest national park in Central Europe. Germany's only high-sea island, Heligoland, is situated in the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|In the North Sea, EUCC {{has contributed}} to the {{recovery}} of stable subtidal and intertidal mussel beds in the Dutch <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> through the Mosselwad project. Another important initiative is “Protect a wreck”, aimed at protecting and cleaning these notable biodiversity sites. Linked to this, the HealthySeas initiative consists on recycling abandoned fishing nets in the sea to recycle them into nylon fabric.|$|E
25|$|Another summer {{tradition}} in Büsum are Wattenlaufen mit Musik and Wattenpolonaise. It was first practiced in 1900 when spa guest Julius Scholz recognized the healing effects of mudflat hiking. To combine treatment with entertainment, spa guests can accompany a band marching {{out on the}} <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> to the water line during low tide, stopping at regular intervals for dancing and games.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands has 20 {{national}} parks {{and hundreds of other}} nature reserves, that include lakes, heathland, woods, dunes and other habitats. Most of these are owned by Staatsbosbeheer, the national department for forestry and nature conservation and Natuurmonumenten (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> in the north, with its tidal flats and wetlands, is rich in biological diversity, and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Nature Site in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} made up of a sandy core of geestland and {{features}} an extended beach all along its west coast, facing the open North Sea. The east coast instead borders to mud flats and tidal creeks of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea.</b> Sand dunes are a characteristical part of Amrum's landscape, resulting in a vegetation that is largely made up of heath and shrubs. The island's only forest was planted in 1948. Amrum is a refuge for many species of birds and a number of marine mammals like grey seal or harbour porpoise.|$|E
25|$|The {{coasts of}} the North Sea {{are home to}} nature {{reserves}} including the Ythan Estuary, Fowlsheugh Nature Preserve, and Farne Islands in the UK and the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> National Parks in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. These locations provide breeding habitat for dozens of bird species. Tens of millions of birds {{make use of the}} North Sea for breeding, feeding, or migratory stopovers every year. Populations of black legged kittiwakes, Atlantic puffins, northern fulmars, and species of petrels, gannets, seaducks, loons (divers), cormorants, gulls, auks, and terns, and many other seabirds make these coasts popular for birdwatching.|$|E
25|$|The Ertebølle {{population}} {{settled on}} promontories, near or on beaches, on islands and along rivers and estuaries {{away from the}} dense forests. The environment most like the then range of the Ertebølle is the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> region of the North Sea from the Netherlands to Denmark. Due to chance fluctuations in the sea level during Ertebølle occupation of the coast and subsequently, many of the culture sites are currently under 3m-4m of water. Some have been excavated by underwater archaeology. The artifacts are in an excellent state of preservation, having been protected by anaerobic mud. On the disadvantage side, water movements have disrupted many sites.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{species in}} the North Sea include species of wrack, among them bladder wrack, knotted wrack, and {{serrated}} wrack. Algae, macroalgal, and kelp, such as oarweed and laminaria hyperboria, and species of maerl are found as well. Eelgrass, formerly common in {{the entirety of the}} <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> was nearly wiped out in the 20th century by a disease. Similarly, sea grass used to coat huge tracts of ocean floor, but have been damaged by trawling and dredging have diminished its habitat and prevented its return. Invasive Japanese seaweed has spread along the shores of the sea clogging harbours and inlets and has become a nuisance.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern and}} western coasts of the North Sea are jagged, formed by glaciers during the ice ages. The coastlines along the southernmost part are covered with the remains of {{deposited}} glacial sediment. The Norwegian mountains plunge into the sea creating deep fjords and archipelagos. South of Stavanger, the coast softens, the islands become fewer. The eastern Scottish coast is similar, though less severe than Norway. From north east of England, the cliffs become lower and are composed of less resistant moraine, which erodes more easily, so that the coasts have more rounded contours. In the Netherlands, Belgium and in East Anglia the littoral is low and marshy. The east coast and south-east of the North Sea (<b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea)</b> have coastlines that are mainly sandy and straight owing to longshore drift, particularly along Belgium and Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Neocorus {{reported}} that {{the main source of}} living for the people of Büsum during his times were fishing and farming. Büsum as a fisher town is primarily known for its specialty Büsumer Krabben (North Sea shrimp, Crangon crangon), which are processed and canned for sale. The first records of shrimping in Büsum date from 1624. During this time, shrimp fishing was mostly done by women with nets in the tidal gullies of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea.</b> At the end of the 19th century, fishing on the high seas became popular and added the need for seafaring fishing boats. Before World War II, Büsum's fishing fleet counted 132 vessels. Since then, the number of fishing vessels has continuously decreased. In 1998, Büsum's fishing fleet consisted of 35 fishing boats, with the harbor hosting 20 additional fishing vessels, mainly from the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The {{realm of}} birds is {{particularly}} plentiful. Amrum counts {{among the most}} important hatching areas for seabirds in Germany. It is the only remaining hatching area for the Eurasian curlew in the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> and the main hatching region for the common eider, but also oystercatchers, shelducks, Arctic terns, seagulls like herring gulls, common gull and the lesser black-backed gull as well as many other species use to hatch there on the beach, in between the dunes or at the mud flats. Since the dunes of Amrum are a protected nature reserve, they are the only dunes along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where sea gulls and ducks are breeding. In other dune areas of the North Sea coast these birds are usually scared off by tourists. Additionally vast swarms of migratory birds will rest on Amrum during the season, e.g. red knot, brent goose or sanderling, all of whom are able to find sufficient food along the coasts of Amrum. Moreover, a number of songbirds can be found and pheasants which were equally introduced as game are common.|$|E
25|$|The British did {{not make}} a secret of their preparations. The {{authorities}} in France and the Batavian Republic were therefore aware of them. The intended landing location was not known to them and they were therefore forced to spread their forces thinly to guard against all eventualities. The Batavian army at the time consisted of two divisions (each of about 10,000 men), one commanded by Lieutenant-General Daendels, the other by Lieutenant-General Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau. The latter had taken up positions in Friesland and Groningen to guard against a landing from the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> or an incursion from the East. Daendels indeed was positioned {{in the northern part of}} North Holland, with headquarters at Schagen. The French troops (only 15,000 of the full complement of 25,000 troops that the Treaty of The Hague called for) were divided between Zeeland (another logical landing spot, where in 1809 the Walcheren Expedition took place), and the middle of the country, strung out between the coast and Nijmegen. The entire Franco-Batavian army was placed under the command of the French General Brune.|$|E
500|$|The same {{considerations}} about {{barriers and}} detours {{that apply to}} long-distance land-bird migration apply to water birds, but in reverse: a large area of land without bodies of water that offer feeding sites {{may also be a}} barrier to a bird that feeds in coastal waters. [...] Detours avoiding such barriers are observed: for example, brent geese Branta bernicla migrating from the Taymyr Peninsula to the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> travel via the White Sea coast and the Baltic Sea rather than directly across the Arctic Ocean and northern Scandinavia.|$|E
500|$|In the North, a German {{artillery}} {{bombardment of}} the Kornwerderzand Position began at 09:00. However, the German batteries {{were forced to}} move away after being surprised by counterfire from the 15cm. aft cannon of Hr. Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau, which had sailed into the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea.</b> Feldt now decided {{to land on the}} coast of North-Holland. A few barges were found; only after the capitulation however, was the crossing actually executed. During this operation one barge foundered and the remainder lost their way. Fears for such a landing had caused Winkelman on 12 May to order the occupation of an improvised [...] "Amsterdam Position" [...] along the North Sea Canal, but only weak forces were available.|$|E
500|$|The {{high ground}} of Esbjerg {{stretches}} {{along the east}} coast of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> (now a UNESCO World Heritage Site) between the rivers of Varde and Sneum, encompassing the coastal area of Ho Bugt and the seaside district of Hjerting to the north. Opposite Esbjerg, across Fanø Bay, is the island of Fanø, [...] by , with Nordby as its principal settlement, connected to Esbjerg by ferry. To the west of Esbjerg, the town boundary is defined by a number of small streams. The highest point is some [...] above sea level. The town is located on top of steep slopes leading down to the flatlands of the harbour area. The built-up area itself is not very hilly but there are considerable differences in terrain. Apart from the cliff in the town park overlooking the harbour, the valley of Fourfelt Bæk, [...] in length, is the main feature of the landscape, resulting in differences of up to [...] with the surroundings.|$|E
2500|$|Mandø {{is one of}} the Danish <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> islands off the {{southwest}} coast of Jutland, Denmark in the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> part of the North Sea. [...] The island covers an area of [...] and has 62 inhabitants. The island is situated approximately [...] southwest of the ancient town of Ribe.|$|E
2500|$|Mandø is {{geographically}} one of {{the northernmost}} islands among the North Frisian Islands off the southwestern Danish and northwestern German coast. The Frisian Islands are generally the line of demarcation separating the North Sea from the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> which is a shallow sea of approximately 5000 square kilometers in size, riddled with small islands and tidal flats. [...] The entire <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> area was formed by intervening riverine depositional periods between Ice Age glacier movements.|$|E
2500|$|They {{had been}} {{seasonal}} migrants to coastal waters {{of both sides}} of Atlantic, including the Baltic Sea, <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, Hudson Bay (possibly), and Pamlico Sound. [...] Radiocarbon dating of subfossil or fossil European (Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom) coastal remains confirms this, with whaling the possible cause. Remains dating from the Roman epoch {{were found in the}} Mediterranean during excavation of the antique harbor of Lattara near Montpellier in 1997, raising the question of whether Atlantic gray whales migrated up and down the coast of Europe from <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> to calve in the Mediterranean. Similarly, radiocarbon dating of American east coastal subfossil remains confirm that gray whales existed there at least through the 17th century. This population ranged at least from Southampton, New York, to Jupiter Island, Florida, the latest from 1675. In his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony a whale of the kind called [...] "scragg" [...] entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. A. B. Van Deinse points out that the [...] "scrag whale", described by P. Dudley in 1725 as one of the species hunted by the early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale.|$|E
2500|$|In {{relation}} to {{environmental protection and}} marine pollution the MARPOL 73/78 Accords created 25- and 50-mile (40 and 80km) zones of protection. [...] Furthermore, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic concerns itself directly {{with the question of}} the preservation of the ocean in the region. [...] Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands have a trilateral agreement {{for the protection of the}} <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> or mudflats, which run along the coasts of the three countries on the southern edge of the North Sea.|$|E
2500|$|Bay muds {{occur in}} bays and {{estuaries}} throughout the temperate {{regions of the}} world. [...] In North America, prominent instances are: (a) the Stellwagen Bank formed 16,000 to 9000 BC by glaciation of Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts, (b) Florida Bay,(c) in California Morro Bay and San Francisco Bay and (d) Knik & Turnagain Arms in Anchorage, Alaska. [...] In the United Kingdom large bay mud occurrences are found at Morecambe Bay, Bridgwater Bay and Bristol Bay. [...] Straddling Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany is the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea,</b> a major formation underlain by bay muds.|$|E
2500|$|Hamburg {{is on the}} {{southern}} point of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe {{to the south and}} Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the north-east. It is on the River Elbe at its confluence with the Alster and Bille. The city centre is around the Binnenalster ("Inner Alster") and Außenalster ("Outer Alster"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The islands of Neuwerk, Scharhörn and Nigehörn, [...] away in the Hamburg <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> National Park, are also part of the city of Hamburg.|$|E
2500|$|Bay mud {{consists}} of thick deposits of soft, unconsolidated silty clay, which is saturated with water; these soil layers are {{situated at the}} bottom of certain estuaries, which are normally in temperate regions that have experienced cyclical glacial cycles. [...] Example locations are Cape Cod Bay, Chongming Dongtan Reserve in Shanghai, China, [...] Banc d'Arguinpreserve in Mauritania, The Bristol Channel in the United Kingdom, Mandø Island in the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> in Denmark, Florida Bay, San Francisco Bay, Bay of Fundy, Casco Bay, Penobscot Bay, and Morro Bay. [...] Bay mud manifests low shear strength, high compressibility and low permeability, making it hazardous to build upon in seismically active regions like the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|E
2500|$|Whaling was an {{important}} economic activity from the 9th until the 13th century for Flemish whalers. The medieval Flemish, Basque and Norwegian whalers who were replaced in the 16th century by Dutch, English, Danes and Germans, took massive numbers of whales and dolphins and nearly depleted the right whales. This activity likely led to the extinction of the Atlantic population of the once common gray whale. By 1902 the whaling had ended. After being absent for 300 years a single gray whale returned, it probably {{was the first of}} many more to find its way through the now ice-free Northwest Passage. Once [...] "fish" [...] were taken in large quantities {{at the mouth of the}} River Seine. Perhaps the gray whale will someday return to its former Seine estuary breeding grounds and to the feeding grounds of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> where it will again roil the sediments and release its benthic nutrients that will benefit the ecosystem.|$|E
2500|$|Conventional motor {{vehicles}} can access Mandø Island via a causeway unpaved roadway, although this route is compromised in storms at high tide. The nearest {{village on the}} mainland which is the gateway to Mandø Island is Vester Vedsted. [...] This simple causeway road {{is no more than}} copious gravel laid down on an immense mudflat, with required frequent periodic maintenance of added gravels. [...] Alternatively many visitors reach the island by way of a specially designed tractor pulled bus with greatly oversized tires. [...] This vehicle is capable of traversing some of the firmer mudflats, but only at the lowest tides. In any case private vehicles or the [...] "Mandø bus" [...] leave the mainland at the point of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> Centre, which offers nature information and boasts a small museum devoted to the natural history of Mandø. Mandø is located midway between the two larger islands Fanø and Rømø which are connected to the mainland by a ferry and a road running across a causeway, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Amrum is one {{of three}} isles with a geestland core in Nordfriesland. This sandy core is made up of glacial deposites from the Saalian glacial period. To the east, it borders to the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea</b> mud flats of the North Sea. The east side is also where the island's ancient hamlets are situated: Norddorf, Nebel, Süddorf and Steenodde. On the geestland core one can find {{extended}} areas of heath and woodland which form a strip that runs along a north-south line on the axis. West of this woodland strip, a region of [...] is covered with dunes that run all along the island for about 12km. The maximal width of this area amounts to more than a kilometre. Amrum's tallest dune near Norddorf is called a Siatler (the settling dune); it reaches 32 m of height. Northward, the dune area extends into a small peninsula called Odde. In the south of Amrum, the newest settlement, Wittdün, is located. West of the dunes, the entire shore of Amrum is made up of the Kniepsand beach; it counts among northern Europe's largest sand beaches. North of Norddorf there is some marshland, another small marsh area can be found between Süddorf and Steenodde. Both of them are protected from the sea by dikes. During low tide it is possible to reach the neighbouring island of Föhr by mudflat hiking.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Batavian {{forces had}} {{had time to}} make their {{preparations}} for the coming event. To understand these, {{it is useful to}} consider the terrain at the proposed landing site, as it was in 1799. (The situation has considerably changed since then.) Den Helder then was just a hamlet with two shore batteries (no more than sconces), called Unie and Revolutie, nearby. It was located at the extreme northern point of a spit of sand that jutted out from the North-Holland peninsula, north of Callantsoog. The spit consisted of three rows of dunes behind the North Sea beach, with a road (the Zanddijk), bordered by a canal, behind them. Behind the canal was a marsh, called the Koegras (that has since been embanked, but was then open to the sea and inundated at every high tide). The sand spit was bordered in the north by the Marsdiep and to the east by the <b>Wadden</b> <b>Sea.</b> It was no more than half a mile wide. Daendels figured that {{it would be impossible to}} sufficiently deploy his division in such a narrow space while fronting the shore. Instead he proposed to have only light forces of skirmishers (...) in the dunes along the likely disembarkation front, but to attack a landing from both the north and the south in a double flank attack, as soon as they had landed. He therefore positioned the 5th and 7th Demi-brigades of the Batavian army under Major-General Van Guericke in Den Helder, together with the 2nd Jagers and several squadrons of light cavalry and horse artillery (about 5,000 men in total). He himself took up position near Callantsoog with the remainder of the 1st Batavian Division, under Major-General Van Zuylen van Nijevelt. This command consisted of the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th Demi-brigades, the 1st Jagers and the 1st Grenadiers (total about 5,200 men). Of course, the implication was that he violated the taboo against dividing his forces, but it seemed the best solution in the circumstances.|$|E
