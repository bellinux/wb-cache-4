Then we study the properties of weakly <b>woven</b> g-frames and give a sufficient condition for <b>weaving</b> g-frames. It is shown that weakly <b>woven</b> is equivalent to <b>woven.</b> Two sufficient conditions for <b>weaving</b> g-Riesz bases are given.

40|$|Motorway {{capacity}} is constrained by turbulent sections such as merging, diverging and <b>weaving</b> areas. A motorway <b>weaving</b> section is {{a segment of}} the road in which an on-ramp is followed by an off-ramp with limited spacing between them. Various equations have been adopted to determine the capacity of such <b>weaving</b> sections. Some of these include factors such as <b>weaving</b> ratio (R), volume ratio (VR) and <b>weaving</b> configuration which influence the <b>weaving</b> capacity. In this paper, drivers’ behaviours at <b>weaving</b> sections were studied in order to assess the effect on capacity of such sections and to aid {{in the development of a}} micro-simulation model to evaluate the performance of these sections for various configurations. Factors such as VR, R, the upstream traffic characteristics, the frequency of lane changes (FLC), the percentage of the pre-segregation for the upstream traffic of <b>weaving</b> section and the length of <b>weaving</b> section were investigated. Therefore, seven sites of <b>weaving</b> sections with different configurations and lengths have been selected. The results of the analysed data indicated that the FLC differs according to the configuration of the <b>weaving</b> section. For example, in the case of ramp <b>weaving</b> sections (i. e. lane gain/lane drop), the results indicated that the maximum FLC in every 76 metres (i. e. equivalent to 250 feet) within the <b>weaving</b> section is up to 1500 per hour. This value was found to be much higher than those reported in other studies. In addition, the effective length that is used by those <b>weaving</b> vehicles is also influenced by the type of <b>weaving</b> configuration. For short <b>weaving</b> sections (i. e. 150 metres or less) the effective length is basically the whole length, whereas, for relatively longer <b>weaving</b> sections (i. e. 300 metres or more), the effective length is found to be equal to 200 metres or less...|$|R

5|$|The Navajo {{may have}} learned to <b>weave</b> from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century. The Navajo {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition.

40|$|The paper {{identifies}} thirteen common {{configurations of}} Type B <b>weaving</b> sections. These configurations are modeled using the INTEGRATION software {{for a wide}} range of <b>weaving</b> section lengths and travel demands. Subsequently, the simulation results are utilized to develop analytical procedures for estimating the capacity of Type B <b>weaving</b> sections and compared to the HCM 2000 procedures. The results demonstrate that the HCM 2000 procedures suffer from four significant drawbacks. First, the procedures can only consider relatively long <b>weaving</b> sections (longer than or equal to 150 m). Second, the HCM procedures fail to capture the impact of the distribution of <b>weaving</b> flows between freeway and on-ramp demand on the capacity of <b>weaving</b> sections, which is demonstrated to be an important factor in the analysis <b>weaving</b> section capacities. Third, the procedures do not ensure that the capacity of a <b>weaving</b> section reverts to the basic freeway capacity when the volume ratio is zero (no <b>weaving</b> flows) regardless of the <b>weaving</b> section length. Finally, the HCM procedures do not ensure consistency between the <b>weaving</b> and merge/diverge procedures at the boundary conditions.

Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike.|$|E
