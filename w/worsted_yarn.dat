25|$|Lubricating {{the frame}} {{components}} (axle bearings, horn blocks and bogie pivots) depends on capillary action: trimmings of <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> are trailed from oil reservoirs into pipes {{leading to the}} respective component. The rate of oil supplied {{is controlled by the}} size of the bundle of yarn and not the speed of the locomotive, so it is necessary to remove the trimmings (which are mounted on wire) when stationary. However, at regular stops (such as a terminating station platform), oil finding its way onto the track can still be a problem.|$|E
25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|E

40|$|Staple fibre yarns vary quite {{markedly}} in {{linear density}} (tex) along their length {{and the degree}} to which twist redistributes from thick to thin places will affect the strength, torque and extension behaviour of the yarn. Theory suggests that twist along <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> should vary as 1 /(tex) 2 if fibres were locked in the structure, whereas themean torque of <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> reported in the literature implies that twist should be proportional to 1 /tex. This article examines twist distribution in ring-spun marl yarns, down to 5 mm resolution, as a function of linear density measured using a high-resolution capacitive sensor. It is found for moderate twist-level <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> that twist is approximately proportional to 1 /(tex) 1. 6.

25|$|Spinning is {{the final}} stage in {{converting}} wool to <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns,</b> the roving being drawn out to its final thickness and twist added for strength. There are three types of spinning machine or frame in common use in the United Kingdom, namely flyer, cap and ring. Another machine used for spinning <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> is the <b>worsted</b> mule. All three types of machine or frame are similar in their method of drawing out or drafting the roving to make the required count or thickness, but differ {{in the way in}} which twist is imparted and the yarn wound onto the bobbin. Drafting takes place between the back and front rollers. The front rollers revolve faster than the back ones, drawing out the roving to the fineness of yarn required. Between the rollers are carriers which support and help to control the fibres as they are being drafted.|$|R

25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns,</b> and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|R

Because of this reason, textile companies analyze regularly the satisfaction level and make great efforts to improve it continuously.

In 1921 these three operations were amalgamated as Ewo Cotton Mills, Ltd. and registered in Hong Kong. Before the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), the three mills operated a total of 175,000 cotton spindles and 3,200 looms.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore whether the {{properties}} of <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns,</b> especially hairiness, can be improved by combining the Solospun and Sirospun processes into a single Solo-Siro spun process. Wool fibres of 19 and 21 μm in average diameter were spun into 40 tex yarns at different twist levels, using the conventional ring, Sirospun and Solo-Siro spun systems, respectively. These yarns were then tested for a range of properties, including hairiness, tenacity, elongation and evenness, for comparison purposes. The statistical analysis results indicate that the hairiness (S 3 value) of Solo-Siro spun yarns was significantly less than that of both Sirospun and normal ring spun yarns. In addition, the tenacity of the Solo-Siro spun yarns was higher than that of the normal ring spun yarns, while changes in yarn breaking elongation were not statistically significant. For the 21 μm wool, {{it was found that the}} evenness of Solo-Siro spun yarns deteriorated slightly in comparison with that of Sirospun and conventional ring spun yarns. <br /...|$|R
