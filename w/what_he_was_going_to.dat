500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting [...] "exactly like an officer of the British army" [...] in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say at the announcement the following day.|$|E
500|$|Saari {{left behind}} two {{handwritten}} {{notes in his}} school dormitory indicating {{that he had been}} planning the massacre for six years. A police spokesperson commented: [...] "Saari left notes saying he had a hatred for mankind, for the whole of the human race, and that he had been thinking about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do for years. The notes show he was very troubled and he hated everything." [...] Police said that although most of the victims were female, the motive {{did not seem to be}} a hatred of women. One of Saari's friends noticed a change in his behaviour two years before the shootings, when Saari began expressing a fondness for guns and an admiration of the school shootings in the United States. He said that around 18 months previously Saari had sent him a message saying that he would carry out a school shooting the next day. Saari reportedly denied being serious about carrying out his threat.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} Greg Ryan, Keogh was [...] "unanimously {{regarded as}} the best back in the colony" [...] and also [...] "one of the most gifted, colourful and ultimately controversial figures of early New Zealand rugby." [...] While rugby writer Terry McLean wrote of Keogh in 1987 that he was [...] "one of those rare birds of rugby, the genuine 'freak'." [...] A correspondent for Christchurch paper The Sun, lamenting a perceived decline in back play, wrote in 1917 that Keogh [...] "was probably the greatest half-back the rugby world has ever produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods. Neither opponents nor spectators knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do next. He was {{the first player to}} bounce the ball on the head of an opponent on a line-out, catch it, and streak down the field. He was an adept in kneeing the ball over the head of an opposing player; he feinted, he hurdled, he kicked; his play was never the same two minutes together." [...] While a teammate of Keoghs from the Natives, George Williams, said in 1925 that he had never seen Keogh's equal. William McKenzie, known as [...] "Off-Side Mac", who played 20 matches for New Zealand in the 1890s, said of Keogh in 1910: [...] "Keogh is {{regarded as the}} trickiest and most brilliantly attacking back ever turned out of the New Zealand school." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E
500|$|On December 14, 2012, {{academic}} and writer Judith Reisman stated {{in a piece}} for WorldNetDaily that in her view Wales had received revenue from a website which dealt in pornography. Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood. I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.' Fix it." ...|$|E

When Mike stops by with Katherine's lasagne, he tries {{to tell him that}} he'll get through it and understands <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> through which causes Dave to lash out saying Mike should go back to his happy life with Katherine and to leave him alone.

2500|$|Soon after, {{an order}} of {{protection}} was granted against Graner to protect his estranged wife.

2500|$|The {{speech was}} drafted with the {{assistance}} of Stanley Levison and Clarence Benjamin Jones in Riverdale, New York City.

2500|$|On the {{day before}} the killing, Chapman accosted singer-songwriter James Taylor at the 72nd Street subway station.

At one amateur match, fight announcer Joe Humphries saw the name [...] "Canagata, Lee" [...] on the card he was using.

2500|$|By 1930 the Fitzgeralds {{were again}} living in Europe. Zelda {{had her first}} nervous {{breakdown}} in early 1930 and was institutionalized in Switzerland. It soon became apparent {{that she would never}} fully recover. Fitzgerald's father died in 1931, an event that was written into the final novel as Dick's father's death. Devastated by these blows (and by his own unrelenting alcoholism), Fitzgerald had settled in suburban Baltimore by 1932 and had finally decided <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write his novel about [...] a man of almost limitless potential who makes the fatal decision to marry a beautiful but mentally ill woman, and who ultimately sinks into despair and alcoholism when their doomed marriage fails.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of public}} opinion, the {{government}} dared not sack Gordon, but the Cabinet was extremely angry about Gordon's insubordination, with many privately saying Gordon if wanted to defy orders by holding Khartoum, then he only deserved <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get. Gladstone himself took Gordon's attacks on his Sudan policy very personally. One Cabinet minister wrote: [...] "The London newspapers and the Tories clamor for {{an expedition to}} Khartoum, the former from ignorance, the latter {{because it is the}} best model of embarrassing us...Of course it is not an impossible undertaking, but it is melancholy to think of the waste of lives and the treasure which it must involve". The Cabinet itself was divided and confused about just {{what to do about the}} Sudan crisis, leading to a highly dysfunctional style of decision-making.|$|E
2500|$|The ban {{ended when}} Roger Sharpe (a star {{witness for the}} AMOA – Amusement and Music Operators Association) testified in April 1976 before a {{committee}} in a Manhattan courtroom that pinball games had become games of skill and were not games of chance, that is, gambling. He began to play one of two games {{set up in the}} courtroom, and – in a move he compares to Babe Ruth's home run in the 1932 World Series – called out precisely <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shoot for, and then proceeded to do so. Astonished committee members reportedly voted to remove the ban, which was followed in other cities. (Sharpe reportedly acknowledges, in a self-deprecating manner, his courtroom shot was by sheer luck although there was admittedly skill involved in what he did.) ...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the issues}} was the album's {{complexity}} and how the touring Beach Boys {{would be able to}} perform its music live. Wilson said that the band [...] "didn't like the idea of growing musically ... They wanted to keep making car songs and I said 'No, we've gotta grow, guys'." [...] Marilyn said: [...] "When Brian was writing Pet Sounds, it was difficult for the guys to understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through emotionally and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to create. ... they didn't feel <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through and <b>what</b> direction <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to go in." [...] Tony Asher remembered: [...] "All those guys in the band, certainly Al, Dennis, and Mike, were constantly saying, 'What the fuck do these words mean?' or 'This isn't our kind of shit!' Brian had comebacks, though. He'd say, 'Oh, you guys can't hack this.'... But I remember thinking that those were tense sessions." ...|$|R
2500|$|On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an {{encounter}} with Mark David Chapman, who would assassinate John Lennon just one day later.

Schlessinger first replied that [...] "some people are hypersensitive" [...] and asked for some examples from the caller. Hanson informed Schlessinger that her acquaintances had stated, [...] "How you black people do this? You black people like doing that." [...] Schlessinger responded that her examples were not racist and that [...] "a lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black.

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E
