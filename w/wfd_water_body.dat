In this paper, taking Sanhejian Coal Mine as an example, we analyze {{the effect of}} cold energy storage in doublet-wells by analyzing the volume change of cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> within different temperature ranges in different periods. Through the analysis of volume change of cold <b>water</b> <b>body,</b> it can prove as time goes, the proportion of 2 - 5 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> is decreasing, the proportion of 5 - 10 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and 10 - 15 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> are maintained at 14 % and 28 %. The 10 - 15 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> predominants in cold energy storage aquifers, and the 5 - 10 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> predominants in the 2 - 10 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> And from the 100 th day to the 200 th day of no pumping and no irrigation, the volumes of 2 - 5 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body,</b> 2 - 10 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and 2 - 15 °C cold <b>water</b> <b>body</b> are decreasing.

40|$|The {{invasion}} of non-indigenous species {{is considered to}} be one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss globally. My research aimed to determine if constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (e. g., <b>water</b> supply reservoirs, dams and ponds) were invaded by zooplankton with greater ease than natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> and whether this was due to a lower biodiversity, and therefore lower 'biotic resistance', in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Sediment cores were collected from a cross-section of 46 lakes, ponds and reservoirs (23 natural and 23 constructed) throughout the North Island, New Zealand. Diapausing zooplankton eggs were separated from the sediments and hatched to assess species composition and richness. In addition, the distributions of non-indigenous zooplankton were examined to determine if they occurred more frequently in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> than in natural ones. Species composition results showed that natural <b>water</b> <b>body</b> zooplankton communities appeared to consist mainly of a core group of truly planktonic species. However, the species assemblages of constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were more varied, comprising of a number of littoral and benthic species, and a large number of species that were recorded from only a single <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that Trophic Level Index explained a significant amount of variation in zooplankton community composition of natural waters (p = 0. 002). Distance to nearest <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and number of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> within a 20 km radius explained significant amounts of variation in community composition of constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (p = 0. 040 and 0. 038 respectively). Average species richness was slightly higher for natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> than constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (18. 47 and 15. 05 respectively), although overall there was a lot of variation for both natural and constructed <b>water</b> <b>body</b> datasets. A stepwise linear regression indicated that latitude and approximate maximum depth of <b>water</b> <b>body</b> were significant predictors of natural <b>water</b> <b>body</b> species richness (p = 0. 002 and 0. 016 respectively). However, no significant predictors of species richness were elucidated for constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The non-indigenous calanoid copepods Sinodiaptomus valkanovi and Boeckella minuta were only found in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, the non-indigenous cladoceran Daphnia galeata was recorded in both natural and constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The non-indigenous calanoid copepods are more likely to establish populations in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> due to the absence of key species (i. e. native calanoid copepods), whose presence in natural waters seemingly provides 'biotic resistance'. The invasion success of D. galeata in constructed and natural waters may be attributed to the absence of a superior competitor, as native Daphnia populations, for example, are rare in the North Island. My results suggest that species richness may not be as important as species composition in influencing the ease with which non-indigenous species invade constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The core group of species found in natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> are likely to be better adapted to pelagic conditions, and therefore better at resisting invaders, than the more varied constructed <b>water</b> <b>body</b> assemblages...|$|R

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the effects of water quality on {{amphibians}} concern experimental conditions. The main aim of our study was to determine whether the quality of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in urban environment may be a factor leading to local extinction of some amphibian species. We investigated the current amphibian richness in Kraków <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and the <b>water</b> quality of these <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> We compared our results with available historical data on amphibian richness in Kraków and we determined the number of amphibian species local extinction for each <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> Then, we compared <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> with low amphibian extinction rates to <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> with high amphibian extinction rates in respect to ten water quality chemical indicators. We found that the values of most chemical indicators were higher in <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> with high amphibian extinction rates. The values of magnesium and chloride ion concentration, as well as conductivity appeared to differ the most between these two types of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> which is connected mainly with spring run-off into the <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The results of this study demonstrate that water pollution may lead to local extinction of amphibian species...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying carbon {{emissions}} of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> at regional scale is required as recent studies revealed their contribution in carbon cycling is significant. This demands {{to scale up}} <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> {{carbon emissions}} from local to regional scale using as accurate approach as possible. In this study data of carbon (CO 2 -C) fluxes for 80 sampled lakes were used to scale {{up to more than}} 3000 lakes and ponds over the catchment. The most appropriate method for upscaling was the one in which two factors of <b>water</b> <b>body</b> size and location (altitude) were involved and the uncertainties were quantified in an advanced approach (Monte Carlo model). Based on the estimates obtained in this method, the annual carbon emission from all <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (~ 500 km 2) was about 2900 ton C yr- 1. About 62 % of this annual emission was related to the large lake Torneträsk (334 km 2) and another 38 % to all other lakes and ponds (166 km 2). <b>Water</b> <b>bodies</b> in subalpine region dominated (90 %) total <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> area and were the major contributor (97 %) to the total carbon emissions of all <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The remaining small contribution (3 %) was for <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in the alpine region, which contains only 10 % of total <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> area. These data indicate that all <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> smaller than the large lake Torneträsk especially the ones in the subalpine region have considerable contribution to the annual carbon emission of all <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Considering <b>water</b> <b>body</b> size and altitude factors in the advanced upscaling method was appropriate to obtain accurate estimates. ...|$|R
40|$|High {{anthropogenic}} modification like infrastructural development, drainage, eutrophication, dumping garbage, is {{a threat}} to biodiversity of smaller <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in agricultural landscapes. However, smaller <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> have historically been constructed for drainage, waste treatment and other purposes. Further, new small <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> are now being constructed in agricultural areas in Sweden, mainly to remove nutrients and to improve landscape biodiversity. This creates two different age classes (old and new) of smaller <b>water</b> <b>body</b> habitats. I sampled aquatic insects in 27 smaller <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> of varying types and ages in Halmstad region and related insect biodiversity, species richness, composition structure to environmental variables. I partitioned the region into two locations (Northern and Southern) for easy data comparison and due to difference in topography. The data was analysed using a Canonical Correspondence (CCA) and regression analysis. The CCA results show a difference in the species composition between old and new sites. The most important variables in explaining species assemblage structure was age of the aquatic <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The species richness decreased with increase in nutrient concentration (total phosphorus) according to regression analysis. Species composition and diversity were related to Vegetation and tree cover in and around the <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> The results of my study shows that the older the <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> the better for specific species like Aeshna cyanea and the new <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> tolerate more specimens. My results suggest that, as there is need to facilitate plant growing, protecting vegetation and trees to better mimic natural conditions of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> creating new <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> while protecting aged <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> is important for conservation of biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|The size, shape, and {{connectivity}} of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (lakes, ponds, and wetlands) {{can have}} important effects on ecological communities and ecosystem processes, but how these characteristics {{are influenced by}} land use and land cover change over broad spatial scales is not known. Intensive alteration of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> during urban development, including construction, burial, drainage, and reshaping, may select for certain morphometric characteristics and influence the types of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> present in cities. We used a database of over one million <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in 100 cities across the conterminous United States to compare the size distributions, connectivity (as intersection with surface flow lines), and shape (as measured by shoreline development factor) of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in different land cover classes. <b>Water</b> <b>bodies</b> in all urban land covers were dominated by lakes and ponds, while reservoirs and wetlands comprised {{only a small fraction}} of the sample. In urban land covers, as compared to surrounding undeveloped land, <b>water</b> <b>body</b> size distributions converged on moderate sizes, shapes toward less tortuous shorelines, and the number and area of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> that intersected surface flow lines (i. e., streams and rivers) decreased. Potential mechanisms responsible for changing the characteristics of urban <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> include: preferential removal, physical reshaping or addition of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> and selection of locations for development. The relative contributions of each mechanism likely change as cities grow. The larger size and reduced surface connectivity of urban <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> may affect the role of internal dynamics and sensitivity to catchment processes. More broadly, these results illustrate the complex nature of urban watersheds and highlight the need to develop a conceptual framework for urban <b>water</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

The scaling exponent of this power law is the fractal dimension of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> which indicates the measure of complexity of the self-similarity of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The iterative opening by reconstruction process is implemented on the individual <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> to compute their fractal dimensions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a Global 3 arc-second <b>Water</b> <b>Body</b> Map (G 3 WBM), using an automated algorithm to process multi-temporal Landsat images from the Global Land Survey (GLS) database. We used 33, 890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless <b>water</b> <b>body</b> map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of <b>water</b> <b>body</b> existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of <b>water</b> <b>body</b> existence at 3 arc-second resolution, the G 3 WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. This suggests that the use of multi-temporal images is as important as analysis at a higher resolution for global <b>water</b> <b>body</b> mapping. The global totals of delineated permanent <b>water</b> <b>body</b> area and temporal water-covered area are 3. 25 and 0. 49 million km 2 respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal images. The accuracy of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing <b>water</b> <b>body</b> databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70 % of lakes > 1 km 2 shows relative water area error < 25 %. Though smaller <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (< 1 km 2) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G 3 WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global <b>water</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{software}} {{has been}} designed to detect <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> that are out in the open on cross-country terrain at close range (out to 30 meters), using imagery acquired from a stereo pair of color cameras mounted on a terrestrial, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). This detector exploits the fact that the color variation across <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> is generally larger and more uniform than that of other naturally occurring types of terrain, such as soil and vegetation. Non-traversable <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> such as large puddles, ponds, and lakes, are detected based on color variation, image intensity variance, image intensity gradient, size, and shape. At ranges beyond 20 meters, <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> out in the open can be indirectly detected by detecting reflections of the sky below the horizon in color imagery. But at closer range, the color coming out of a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> dominates sky reflections, and the water cue from sky reflections is of marginal use. Since there may be times during UGV autonomous navigation when a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> does not come into a perception system s field of view until it is at close range, the ability to detect <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> at close range is critical. Factors that influence the perceived color of a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> at close range are the amount and type of sediment in the water, the water s depth, and the angle of incidence to the <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> Developing a single model of the mixture ratio of light reflected off the water surface (to the camera) to light coming out of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> (to the camera) for all <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> would be fairly difficult. Instead, this software detects close <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> based on local terrain features and the natural, uniform change in color that occurs across the surface from the leading edge to the trailing edge...|$|R
40|$|Amphibian {{species have}} been {{considered}} as useful ecological indicators. They are used as indicators of environmental contamination, ecosystem health and habitat quality., Amphibian species are sensitive {{to changes in the}} aquatic environment and therefore, may form the basis for the classification of <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>bodies</b> in which there are a large number of amphibian species are especially valuable even if they are located in urban areas. The automation of the classification process allows for a faster evaluation of the presence of amphibian species in the <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Three machine-learning methods (artificial neural networks, decision trees and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm) have been used to classify <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in Chorzów – one of 19 cities in the Upper Silesia Agglomeration. In this case, classification is a supervised data mining method consisting of several stages such as building the model, the testing phase and the prediction. Seven natural and anthropogenic features of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (e. g. the type of <b>water</b> <b>body,</b> aquatic plants, the purpose of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> (destination), position of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> in relation to any possible buildings, condition of the <b>water</b> <b>body,</b> the degree of littering, the shore type and fishing activities) have been taken into account in the classification.

Therefore, stable <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> that act as refuge habitats will become increasingly important {{to the maintenance of}} freshwater biodiversity. Man-made <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> such as those associated with water-resource infrastructure could contribute to the available refuge habitat but little is known about fish, zooplankton and frog assemblages in such <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> We quantified the diversity and abundance of fish, zooplankton and frogs that reside within raw water storages and water reclamation plants and compared them to assemblages from nearby natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> over a total of 19 <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Overall, the faunal assemblages within the man-made <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> showed similarities to the nearby natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> with very few differences found among the three <b>water</b> <b>body</b> types. Diversity of available substrates and of submerged and emergent macrophytes were the habitat variables best correlated with diverse faunal assemblages.

This study aimed to identify common characteristics of three Arctic wetlands including <b>water</b> <b>body</b> size and abundance for different spatial resolutions, and the potential of Landsat- 5 TM satellite data to show the subpixel fraction of water cover (SWC) via the surface albedo. <b>Water</b> <b>bodies</b> were mapped using optical and radar satellite data with resolutions of 4 m or better, Landsat- 5 TM at 30 m and the MODIS water mask (MOD 44 W) at 250 m resolution. Study sites showed similar properties regarding <b>water</b> <b>body</b> distributions and scaling issues. Abundance-size distributions showed a curved pattern on a log-log scale with a flattened lower tail and an upper tail that appeared Paretian.

These surveys were done {{in the framework of}} the 'Reference Freshwater Monitoring’. In addition the results provide the biological information (fish) required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The raw data is published on GBIF and can be derived as such, this data set provides the data as provided in the individual and corresponding figure of the report. We also provide an overview of the results 2013 - 2015 as we completed cycle 1 (spread over 3 years) in the framework of WFD. The 2015 results are displayed per basin and concisely discussed in several chapters. We surveyed 25 locations in 2015. We used electro fishing, fyke nets, trawl netting or a combination (multi-method) of these methods. The 25 sites are located in 25 <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> of which 13 are Flemish <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and 12 local <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> There were only three sites without fish. We discuss the occurrence of the species for the period 2013 - 2015 survey results. We also compare the EQR values (Ecological Quality Ratio) as these are a measure of the ecological condition of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and are therefore important {{in the context of the}} Water Framework Directive. The results are briefly discussed in several chapters, and a comparison was made with earlier EQR scores (period of 2010 - 2012). We surveyed 199 locations in the period 2013 - 2015. We caught 42 fish species. In 96. 5 % of the sites fish was present. With a presence in 58 % of the sites, eel and the three-spined stickleback, were the most frequently caught species, followed by roach in 48 % of the sites, then perch (47 %) and gudgeon (42 %). 167 locations on rivers and streams were sampled. The sites are located in 63 different local <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and 68 different Flemish <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Only 8 % of the waterbodies were in a ‘good condition’. Most of the sampled <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were in a ’moderate condition‘ (44 %). 30 % of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were in a 'poor state' and 20 % of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> had a 'bad quality’. The local <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> have the least locations with a ‘good condition’. Only 3 % were in a 'good condition,' while 33 % were in a ‘poor state’. For the Flemish <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> 12 % were in a ‘good condition’ while only 9 % were in a state of ‘poor quality’. If we look at the <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in each stratum, we see that water courses of the type "small stream" were in the worst shape. About 35 % of these <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were in a’ bad state’ and only 4 % were in ‘good condition’. The type “big stream and small river” had the best scores. The bulk scored a ‘moderate quality’. This stratum contains <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> having the largest share of the ‘good quality’class (14 %). At basin level, the River Nete basin scored best, 23 % of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were in ‘good condition’ followed by the River Maas basin, where 12. 5 % of the sampled <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were in the ‘good condition’ status. For EQR results of channels we have data from 31 sites located in 19 different water bodies; 17 Flemish <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and two local <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The major part of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> was in the category ‘poor quality’ (58 %) while 10 % achieved a ’good ecological potential’.

50|$|If <b>water</b> <b>body</b> {{is large}} and very deep, a strong wave action is at work, {{therefore}} in these bodies a noticeable change cannot easily be observed. However, in smaller <b>water</b> <b>body</b> such as a pond the succession is easily recognizable. Different plant communities occupy different zones in a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and exhibit concentric zonation. The edges of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> are occupied by rooted species, submerged species {{are found in the}} littoral zone and plankton and floating species occupy the open water zone.|$|R
40|$|Having {{reliable}} {{estimates of}} the number of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> on different geographical scales is of great importance to better understand biogeochemical cycles and to tackle the social issues related to the economic and cultural use of <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, limnological research suffers from a lack of reliable inventories; the available scientific references are predominately based on <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> of natural origin, large in size and preferentially located in previously glaciated areas. Artificial, small and randomly distributed <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> especially ponds, are usually not inventoried. Following Wetzel’s theory (1990), some authors included them in global inventories by using remote sensing or mathematical extrapolation, but fieldwork on the ground has been done on a very limited amount of territory. These studies have resulted in an explosive increase in the estimated number of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> going from 8. 44 million lakes (Meybeck 1995) to 3. 5 billion <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (Downing 2010). These numbers raise several questions, especially about the methodology used for counting small-sized <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and the methodological treatment of spatial variables. In this study, we use inventories of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> for Sweden, Finland, Estonia and France to show incoherencies generated by the “global to local” approach. We demonstrate that one universal relationship does not suffice for generating the regional or global inventories of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> because local conditions vary greatly from one region to another and cannot be offset adequately by each other. The current paradigm for global estimates of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in limnology, which is based on one representative model applied to different territories, does not produce sufficiently exact global inventories. The step-wise progression from the local to the global scale requires the development of many regional equations based on fieldwork; a specific equation that adequately reflects the actual relationship between distribution and abundance of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in a given area must be produced for each geographical region...|$|R
40|$|Fish and {{zooplankton}} {{populations of}} nine Ethiopian freshwater lakes were quantitatively sampled along a North–South gradient. Differences in altitude and latitude {{resulted in a}} temperature gradient from North to South. We tested three hypotheses: (1) the degree of zooplanktivory decreases with water temperature, i. e. from North to South; (2) the degree of zooplanktivory increases with the abundance of large-bodied zooplankton; and (3) the pattern of zooplanktivory in eutrophic Ethiopian <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> differs from other tropical and temperate <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Proportions of zooplanktivory in the fish communities did not show a geographical trend, but mainly depended on fish species, zooplankton density {{and the availability of}} large-bodied cladocerans. The degree of zooplanktivory in eutrophic Ethiopian <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> differs from other eutrophic <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> both temperate and tropical. In Ethiopia, the degree of zooplanktivory can be both low and high, in contrast with other tropical <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> where zooplanktivory is generally low and with temperate eutrophic <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> where it is generally high. As a result, predation pressure on zooplankton by fish varies dramatically amongst Ethiopian <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> ...|$|R
