5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds were}} first {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations {{of a bright}} scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped {{the distribution of the}} clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The Ideas {{from the}} Deep team {{could not afford}} to leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they {{continued}} to work at Softdisk, spending their time on the Gamer's Edge games during the day and on Commander Keen at night and weekends using Softdisk computers. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon removed from the group. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking moment <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ancestry of the Kerry Bog Pony is unknown, {{but there}} were horses living a feral existence in peat bogs {{in what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland since at least the 1600s. Some enthusiasts claim that the breed is a descendant of the ancient Irish Hobby. In a 1617 book illustration, the horses pictured resemble both the Kerry Bog Pony of today and the original Irish Hobby, showing the two breeds' similar morphology. Originally, Kerry Bog Ponies were used to transport peat and kelp. They were known for their ability to navigate through the bogs, around soft spots and over rocks often in wet and windy weather, and for their strength relative to their small size. Some were trained to work in harness and used to pull carts. The ponies were turned loose into the peat bogs <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> needed, then later re-caught for work. Few if any breeding programs existed; instead, they were left to reproduce in their feral setting. In 1720, Isaac Ware travelled to County Kerry and observed that the horses resembled Asturcón ponies from Spain.|$|E

25|$|After {{a request}} from the {{fisheries}} organizations, the Navy Air Services agreed {{to assist in the}} search for herring. The station was reactivated on 5 February 1919 and two days later the two Sopwiths were attempted returned to Avaldsnes. However, both had motor issues during flight. Not until 13 February did the aircraft reach their destination. Fisheries patrol continued until 7 April. There were plans to return the following year, but this was not carried through. Instead the buildings were attempted sold to Bø Teglverk. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to pay, they were instead moved to Flatøy in 1922.|$|E
25|$|Some psychiatrists {{regarded}} seizures as therapeutic {{and patients}} were sometimes also given electroconvulsive therapy or cardiazol/metrazol convulsive therapy during the coma, {{or on the}} day of the week when they didn’t have insulin treatment. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> in a coma, insulin coma patients were kept together in a group and given special treatment and attention. One handbook for psychiatric nurses, written by British psychiatrist Eric Cunningham Dax, instructs nurses to take their insulin patients out walking and occupy them with games and competitions, flower-picking and map-reading, etc. Patients required continuous supervision as there was a danger of hypoglycemic aftershocks after the coma.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{officers}} involved {{received some}} punishment by Japanese authorities {{at the end}} of the war. After the end of the war, 11 Japanese officers were found guilty with one soldier being sentenced to death by the Batavia War Criminal Court. The court decision found that the charge violated was the Army's order to hire only voluntary women. Victims from East Timor testified they were forced into slavery even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> old enough to have started menstruating. The court testimonies state that these prepubescent girls were repeatedly raped by Japanese soldiers while those who refused to comply were executed.|$|E

25|$|He {{emphasized}} in his 1977 book that the ill-tempered {{aspects of his}} on-screen persona did not reflect his real personality. He also boasted of being a shrewd businessman by wisely investing the money made from his film career. But the Stooges received no subsequent royalties (i.e., residuals) from any of their many shorts; they were paid a flat amount for each one, and Columbia owned the rights (and profits) thereafter. However, according to Larry Fine in the 1970s, Columbia allowed the Stooges to do live tours <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> filming in exchange for half-salary during those months. Fine indicated that the profits from the tours substantially increased their yearly take.|$|E

On 21 May 1951 Meena Kumari {{was involved in a}} serious motor car accident while returning from Mahabaleshwar to Bombay. She was admitted to Sasoon hospital in Poona, was severely injured around the left hand, and there was some doubt whether {{she would be able to}} use it again. Kumari went through terrible bouts of depression, and Kamal Amrohi religiously visited her during her days in the hospital. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> scheduled to meet, both Kumari and Amrohi would write letters to each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{meeting of}} drummer Roger Taylor in 1979 with John Taylor, Rhodes and Wickett at a party, {{as well as}} the {{departure}} of Colley, led John Taylor to switch to bass. Roger Taylor then became their original (human) drummer. It was this line-up (John Taylor on bass and guitar along with Rhodes, Wickett and Roger Taylor) that made the first-ever Duran Duran studio demo tapes. In April 1980, guitarist Andy Taylor came from Newcastle to audition after responding to an advertisement in Melody Maker. In May 1980, London vocalist Simon Le Bon was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the Rum Runner. The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys and busboys <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> rehearsing.|$|E

25|$|Eccentric and opinionated, Thayer {{grew more}} so as he aged, and his family's manner of living {{reflected}} his strong beliefs: the Thayers typically slept outdoors year-round {{in order to}} enjoy the benefits of fresh air, and the three children were never enrolled in a school. The younger two, Gerald and Gladys, shared their father's enthusiasms, and became painters. In 1898, Thayer visited St Ives, Cornwall and, with an introductory letter from C. Hart Merrian, the Chief of the US Biological Survey in Washington, D.C., applied to {{the lord of the}} Manor of St Ives and Treloyhan, Henry Arthur Mornington Wellesley, the 3rd Earl Cowley, for permission to collect specimens of birds from the cliffs at St Ives. During this latter part of his life, among Thayer's neighbors was George de Forest Brush, with whom (<b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> quarreling) he collaborated on camouflage.|$|E
25|$|At first Genie {{usually did}} {{not listen to}} anyone unless someone {{directly}} addressed her or if Curtiss played classical music on the piano, and if someone spoke to her she almost never acknowledged the other person and usually walked away after a while. In {{an effort to get}} Genie to listen to other people Curtiss began reading children's stories to her, and at first she did not seem to engage, but one day in mid-October 1971 Curtiss saw that Genie was clearly listening and responding to her. After that she paid attention to people even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> speaking directly to or about her. She became somewhat more sociable in her interactions with people and became somewhat more responsive, although she still frequently showed no obvious signs that she heard someone. Her reactions to most stimuli became more rapid, but even by the end of her stay she sometimes took several minutes before giving a response to somebody.|$|E
25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to {{take her}} {{frustration}} out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E
