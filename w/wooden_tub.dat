500|$|The Rochdale {{system was}} first used in 1869. [...] It used a <b>wooden</b> <b>tub,</b> or pail (sometimes half of a {{petroleum}} barrel), which was placed under the closet seat. [...] The pails were often circular (to aid cleaning), and were designed to be easily handled and of a size that encouraged regular collections. [...] The top of the pail carried a cast iron rim about 3inches deep to receive a tight-fitting inner lid. [...] The pails were collected {{on a weekly basis}} during the day. [...] Each pail was secured by its lid and loaded onto a sealed 24-bay wagon to be taken to a depot where they were emptied, cleaned and returned. [...] While the pail was removed from the closet, a replacement was installed in its place. [...] In 1874, Rochdale Corporation employed five such wagons in full-time service, collecting from 3,354privies spread across the town. [...] By contrast, with a much larger population, Manchester Corporation employed 73wagons. [...] By 1875, 4,741pails were in use, and in 1876 the number was5,566. [...] A separate cart accompanied the wagon to collect other household refuse which was collected from a separate chamber in the pail closet.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing southwards, the Stirchley Furnaces, also {{owned by}} the Botfields, were on the east bank, with the Jerry Furnaces, {{where there was a}} forge and rolling mills, on the west. The Bishtons owned Langley Furnaces, which were some [...] {{to the west of the}} canal, and they were {{connected}} to the canal by a tramway. There was another reservoir on the west bank before the canal reached Stirchley Tunnel, beyond which the route divided. The route to Coalport turned eastwards before turning back to the south, where there were boat repair sheds and the head of Windmill incline. Below the incline, the canal was crossed by another road and entered Tweedale Basin. A tramway connected the basin to the Madeley Court Furnaces, to the west of the canal, and a rather longer one served Halesfield and Kemberton Collieries, both of which also supplied the canal with water which was pumped from the workings. A tramway connected the two collieries, both of which also produced ironstone, and a long tramway inclined plane descended to a small side basin on the line of the canal. The 1883 Ordnance Survey map shows a much larger basin a little to the north, with a wharf at its western end. Railways and spoil heaps had obliterated the canal beyond the basin by this date. Brown includes a picture of two ladies and a gentleman standing in a tub boat, which is in the basin. It was owned by W Richards, the last person to operate tub boats on the southern section of the canal. There is also a picture of the overgrown basin in 1957, with a <b>wooden</b> <b>tub</b> boat clearly visible.|$|E

5000|$|The term Tiene {{comes from}} the wooden vats in which the grapes were pressed for {{processing}} into wine, used originally in the 16th and 17th centuries.

5000|$|Wooden hot tubs: round <b>wooden</b> hot <b>tubs</b> {{peaked in}} {{popularity}} in the 1970s, having now been replaced by modern construction methods. <b>Wooden</b> hot <b>tubs</b> are often made of redwood or cedar and assembled from vertical staves and the structure is held together like wooden barrels, with metal bands.|$|R

A wet and bedraggled creature, a sort of sexless and shivering scarecrow, washed glasses in there, bending over a <b>wooden</b> <b>tub</b> by the light of a tallow dip.|$|E

60|$|How {{did it get}} {{mixed up}} with all the spoil? and how had it been carried so far on horseback without being hurt? Nobody ever knew. It came as if the fairies had sent it. English it was, but the best Scot could not hate such a pretty child. Old Nancy Dryden ran up to the old nursery with it, and laid it in a great <b>wooden</b> <b>tub</b> full of hot water, and was giving it warm milk to drink, and dandling it, almost before the men knew what had happened.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} narrow-gauge railways were crude wooden trackways used in {{coal mines}} to guide <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs.</b> Because of the restricted loading gauge of the tunnels {{and the need}} for the tubs to be small enough to be pushed by one man, these railways were almost all narrow gauge. These underground lines often had short above-ground sections as well.|$|R
60|$|They {{ascended the}} stairs. At the top {{there was a}} sort of wide porch, with a wooden roof; which was {{completely}} covered with creepers, growing from two <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs.</b> Four or five plants, covered with blossoms, stood on the low walls; and two or three chairs showed that the little terrace was used as an open-air sitting room.|$|R
50|$|A Tiene (plural: Tienen), {{sometimes}} {{also called}} Tine or Obsttiene, {{was a special}} container for transporting wine and fruit. These were used until shortly after the First World War, mostly in the Brandenburg city of Werder in northern Germany. Normally the <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs</b> were carried on people's backs to small boats and shipped on the Havel River to market stalls in Berlin.|$|R
60|$|And {{then they}} all went down a second stage in another bucket; and then a third in a third bucket; and then the {{business}} commenced. As far as this point passive courage alone had been required; to stand upright in a <b>wooden</b> <b>tub</b> and go down, and down, and down, was in itself easy enough, {{so long as the}} heart did not utterly faint. Mr. Neverbend's heart had grown faintish, but still he had persevered, and now stood on a third lobby, listening with dull, unintelligent ears to eager questions asked, by his colleague, and to the rapid answers of their mining guides. Tudor was absolutely at work with paper and pencil, taking down notes in that wretched Pandemonium.|$|E
60|$|And, {{like any}} other common lass, she found her 'boy.' It was an electrician, one of the electricians {{introduced}} according to Gerald's new scheme. He was an earnest, clever man, a scientist {{with a passion for}} sociology. He lived alone in a cottage, in lodgings, in Willey Green. He was a gentleman, and sufficiently well-to-do. His landlady spread the reports about him; he WOULD have a large <b>wooden</b> <b>tub</b> in his bedroom, and every time he came in from work, he WOULD have pails and pails of water brought up, to bathe in, then he put on clean shirt and under-clothing EVERY day, and clean silk socks; fastidious and exacting he was in these respects, but in every other way, most ordinary and unassuming.|$|E
6000|$|By the cloisterly Temple, and by Whitefriars (there, {{not without}} a glance at Hanging-Sword Alley, which {{would seem to be}} {{something}} in his way), and by Blackfriars Bridge, and Blackfriars Road, Mr. George sedately marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that ganglion of roads from Kent and Surrey, and of streets from the bridges of London, centring in the far-famed elephant who has lost his castle formed of a thousand four-horse coaches to a stronger iron monster than he, ready to chop him into mince-meat any day he dares. To one of the little shops in this street, which is a musician's shop, having a few fiddles in the window, and some Pan's pipes and a tambourine, and a triangle, and certain elongated scraps of music, Mr. George directs his massive tread. And halting at a few paces from it, as he sees a soldierly looking woman, with her outer skirts tucked up, come forth with a small <b>wooden</b> <b>tub,</b> and in that tub commence a-whisking and a-splashing on the margin of the pavement, Mr. George says to himself, [...] "She's as usual, washing greens. I never saw her, except upon a baggage-waggon, when she wasn't washing greens!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Villa was {{especially}} {{famous for its}} collection of dwarf citrus trees, especially lemon trees, which were grown in large <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs,</b> and put under shelter in the winter. The cultivation of citrus trees in Europe had begun in the mid-15th century, and was carried out {{on a large scale}} at Villa di Castello. Collections of citrus trees, later housed inside heated greenhouses called orangeries or lemon houses, became a feature of palaces around Europe.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} 18th century, {{widespread}} {{public interest in}} the study of nature was awakening, and fish were kept in glass jars, porcelain containers, <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs,</b> and small artificial ponds. It was during this time that zoologist and botanist, Johann Matthaeus Bechstein, kept a large number of fishes and amphibians and laid down the foundation for aquarium and terrarium science. The concepts of the proper aquarium and terrarium were developed later by Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward in 1829.|$|R

50|$|In 1843, Nancy M. Johnson {{invented the}} first ice cream maker with a crank {{on the outside}} of the <b>wooden</b> <b>tub.</b> The crank mixes the ice cream, while also {{scraping}} the frozen ice cream off of the sides of the pot. Before 1843, making ice cream required more time. The crank {{on the outside of}} the <b>wooden</b> <b>tub</b> eliminates the step of removing the pot from the <b>wooden</b> <b>tub</b> to scrape the sides of the pot of frozen ice cream. After the creation of Nancy Johnson’s invention, commercial ice cream companies started to use ice cream makers powered by “horse-powered treadmills, steam engines, and finally electric motors”. People who made ice cream at home began using electric ice cream makers as well. Ice cream production was more popular when sugar became cheaper and ice was easier to attain. After the Civil War ended, ice cream prices had decreased, and more wholesalers had joined the ice cream making business.|$|E

The <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs,</b> known as [...] "hunds" [...] ("dog" [...] in German) ran on two wide boards or rails and were used to move ore within the mines. These hunds used a guide pin system, utilising the slot between the two board rails to keep them on course.|$|R
50|$|Steinbier is not mashed in kettles, but in <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs.</b> Its name {{is derived}} from the hot stones that were put into the mashing tubs to achieve the {{required}} temperature for production. Due to the contact of the glowing, hot stones - often heated directly in the fire - with the malt, the resulting beer has a taste of caramel and soot. This was a traditional brewing process; top-fermenting yeasts and a taste of fruity ester were usual and there was no emphasis on long term storability. Steinbier was usually not filtered.|$|R
50|$|The lardo, one of {{a number}} of {{preserved}} meat specialties of the region, is produced by curing pieces of fatback in a brine aromatised with such herbs and spices as juniper, bay, nutmeg, sage and rosemary. The brining takes place in <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs</b> known as doïls, which may be made of chestnut, oak or larch, and are used solely for this purpose; it is known that Lard d’Arnad has been made for more than two centuries since a 1763 inventory from Arnad Castle refers to four doïls which belonged to its kitchens. It is often eaten with black bread and honey.|$|R

50|$|The {{ruins of}} Wildenlak Castle, also {{known locally as}} Old Castle (Stari grad), lie above the settlement. It was {{destroyed}} in the 1511 Idrija earthquake and never rebuilt. In 1873 public baths were established at the Anka Mansion (vila Anka) in the settlement, featuring <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs</b> and a stove for heating the water. The Lubnik Lodge (Planinski dom na Lubniku) was built before the Second World War. It was burned {{during the war and}} rebuilt in 1953. A plaque on the lodge commemorates two hikers that were shot by German forces on Mount Lubnik in 1941.|$|R
50|$|A two-room {{cabin and}} a dog house were built on the gravel bank near the springs. Two small log bathhouses, {{possibly}} built earlier {{on each side of}} the springs, had <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs</b> and sweat chambers and were in operation in 1911. The bathhouses were used in winter by both whites and natives but less in the summer due to having difficult summer trails. The analysis of the water in 1915 showed clear dark water similar to black sulfur waters. In 1915, the Kokrines supported the Hub Roadhouse, a small trading point and post office on the north side of the Yukon River. The distance from there was about 16 miles.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, bathing {{commonly}} {{took place}} in public bathhouses. Public baths were also havens for prostitution, which created opposition to the public baths. Rich people bathed at home, most likely in their bedroom, as 'bath' rooms were not common. Bathing was done in large, <b>wooden</b> <b>tubs</b> with a linen cloth laid in it to protect the bather from splinters. Additionally, during the Renaissance and Protestant Reformation, the quality and condition of the clothing (as opposed to the actual cleanliness of the body itself) were thought to reflect the soul of an individual. Clean clothing also reflected one's social status; clothes made the man or woman.|$|R
