Fetal reduction can be considered in these women. study design, size, and duration: Retrospective cohort study of 118 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> twin pregnancy reduced to a singleton pregnancy between 2000 and 2010. participants/materials, setting, and methods: We compared the outcome of pregnancy in consecutive <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dichorionic twin pregnancy that was reduced to a singleton pregnancy to that of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dichorionic twin pregnancy that was managed expectantly and <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> primary singleton pregnancy.

There {{is a need for}} {{a better understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms for a better diagnosis and treatment of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD, because they are good in hiding the characteristics of an ASD. The current study compares different aspects of social cognition between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high functioning ASD and typical developed (TD) women through <b>a</b> comparison between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> and without <b>an</b> ASD.

A total of 31 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD and 30 TD women participated in this study. The prosody task of the ANT was used for recognition of basic emotions. For the visual emotion recognition the Facial Expression Recognition task was used.

The Dewey Social Story test was used for an impression of perspective taking and understanding of usual and unusual social situations. Results show that <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD have more difficulty with perspective taking and in understanding of other people’s mental states.

Moderated regression analyses revealed that (a) general anxiety at baseline predicted general anxiety at follow-up in both <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> specific phobia and <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> social anxiety disorder and (b) avoidance behavior moderated this relationship in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> specific phobia but not in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> social anxiety disorder. Specifically, high avoidance behavior was found to amplify the effect between general anxiety at baseline and follow-up in specific phobia. Reasons for the absence of a similar moderating effect of avoidance behavior within social anxiety disorder are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Results from {{a number}} of {{long-term}} follow-up studies have suggested that hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. More recently, this putative relationship has been substantiated with findings of elevated cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profiles and glucose, in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Homocysteine is a sensitive indicator of increased risk but data on homocysteine levels in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders are inconsistent. Design: This cohort study included 279 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders at term and 85 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of uncomplicated pregnancies who participated in the Hypitat Risk Assessment Study (HyRAS). Methods: Blood samples for total homocysteine determination were taken 2. 5 years postpartum. Homocysteine levels were determined in plasma using <b>an</b> immunoassay. Results: <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders had significant higher median homo- cysteine levels (10. 66 l mol/L) 2. 5 years postpartum compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history uncomplicated pregnancies (9. 82 l mol/L; p = 0. 002). <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders had a higher risk of having a homocysteine level in the highest quartile (odds ratio 3. 4, 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 – 7. 6). Conclusion: At 2. 5 years postpartum, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history hypertensive pregnancy disorders had higher homocysteine levels than women who had uncomplicated pregnancies. Although higher homocysteine levels might be a potential link between a history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders and increased cardiovascular disease risk later in life, the clinical implications remain an area for future research.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{pregnancy}} outcomes of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy that {{was reduced to}} a singleton pregnancy and to review the literature. METHODS: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study. We compared time to delivery and perinatal mortality in dichorionic triplet pregnancies reduced to singletons with ongoing dichorionic triplet pregnancies and primary singleton pregnancies. Additionally, we reviewed the literature on the subject. RESULTS: We studied 46 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced dichorionic triplet pregnancy and 42 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ongoing dichorionic triplet pregnancy. Median gestational age at delivery was 38. 7 vs. 32. 8 weeks, respectively (p < 0. 001). Delivery < 24 weeks occurred in 9 (19. 6 %) <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced triplet pregnancy and 4 (9. 5 %) <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ongoing triplet pregnancy (p = 0. 19). Perinatal survival rates between the reduced group and the ongoing triplet group were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Multifetal pregnancy reduction in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dichorionic triplet pregnancy to a singleton pregnancy prolongs median gestational age at birth. No statistically significant association was found with miscarriage and perinatal survival rates...|$|R
