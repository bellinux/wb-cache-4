5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the deprotonation {{of all types}} of salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Just Dance {{originated}} from a minigame developed {{for inclusion in}} the Rayman Raving Rabbids series. Ubisoft France's managing director Xavier Poix and his team felt the Wii Remote and Nunchuck would <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> music games; Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 featured a music minigame that IGN compared to Guitar Hero—where players shook the Wii Remote or Nunchuck when prompted to play an instrument. For , the concept was iterated into a pose-based dance game. Proving popular in demonstrations, the concept was refined and re-developed into a stand-alone game.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{breakers}} dance {{within a}} cypher or an Apache Line. A cypher is a circular shaped dance space formed by spectators that breakers use to perform or battle in. Cyphers <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> one-on-one b-boy or b-girl (break-boy/break-girl) battles; however, Apache Lines are more appropriate when {{the battle is}} between two crews—teams of street dancers. In contrast to the circular shape of a cypher, competing crews can face each other in this line formation, challenge each other, and execute their burns (a move intended to humiliate the opponent, i.e. crotch grabbing).|$|E

Oxenford said that adoption of the internet by more than three billion people has made television more effective as a driver of traffic to websites or apps than {{it was during the}} early dot-com period, when television advertising didn't <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> websites.|$|E
25|$|In {{automotive}} {{engine and}} diesel engine turbochargers and superchargers. Ref. Figure 1.1 Centrifugal compressors {{used in conjunction}} with reciprocating internal combustion engines are known as turbochargers if driven by the engine’s exhaust gas and turbo-superchargers if mechanically driven by the engine. Standards set by the industry for turbochargers may have been established by SAE. Ideal gas properties often <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the design, test and analysis of turbocharger centrifugal compressor performance.|$|E

25|$|A shield can be {{effective}} against one type of electromagnetic field but not against another. For example, a copper foil or screen RF shield will be minimally effective against power frequency magnetic fields. A power frequency magnetic shield could offer little reduction of radio frequency fields. The {{same is true for}} different RF frequencies. A simple large-mesh screen shield can <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> lower frequencies, but can be ineffective for microwaves.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, mixed algae {{cultures}} can <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> larval mollusks. First, the cultivator filters the {{sea water}} to remove algae which are {{too large for}} the larvae to eat. Next, the cultivator adds nutrients and possibly aerates the result. After {{one or two days}} in a greenhouse or outdoors, the resulting thin soup of mixed algae is ready for the larvae. An advantage of this method is low maintenance.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to find American Windsors made in the 18th century that contain three {{different}} species of wood. Pine, bass or tulip poplar are common for the seat. Non ring porous hardwoods such as Maple are stiff and make crisp turnings, and {{were used for the}} undercarriage. Ring porous species such as Oak, ash, and hickory all rive (split) and steam bend nicely. These woods are also straight grained and flexible and thus <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> slender parts such as the spindles.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is called the}} Williamson ether synthesis. It involves treatment of a parent alcohol with a strong base to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable leaving group (R–X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include iodide, bromide, or sulfonates. This method usually does not <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> aryl halides (e.g. bromobenzene, see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory. The {{problem here is that}} representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to <b>work</b> <b>well.</b> <b>For</b> groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
25|$|Also the {{deflection}} {{of light}} by massive bodies was predicted. Although the approximation was crude, it {{allowed him to}} calculate that the deflection is nonzero. German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich publicized Einstein's challenge to scientists around the world. This urged astronomers to detect the deflection of light during a solar eclipse, and gave Einstein confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by Gunnar Nordström was incorrect. But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small {{by a factor of}} two, because the approximation he used doesn't <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> things moving at near the speed of light. When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun.|$|E

25|$|Another type of device {{people use}} {{to help their}} recall memory become {{efficient}} chunking. Chunking {{is the process of}} breaking down numbers into smaller units to remember the information or data, this helps recall numbers and math facts. An example of this chunking process is a telephone number; this is chunked with three digits, three digits, then four digits. People read them off as such when reciting a phone number to another person. There has been research done about these techniques and an institution tested two groups of people to see if these types of devices <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> real people, the results came back determining a significant performance difference between the group who did not use cognitive strategies and the group who did. The group using the techniques immediately performed better than the other group and when taking a pre-test and post-test the results indicated that the group using the techniques improved while the other group did not.|$|E
500|$|The GHTV mode earned mixed opinions, {{with most}} reviewers praising the concept. The {{presentation}} of the channels was highlighted as hearkening to the heyday of MTV, and praised for providing players {{with the ability to}} explore new music. The selection of songs for GHTV was considered very diverse, and some reviewers found the GHTV songlist to be better varied than the on-disc list, providing songs from [...] "six-string classic" [...] bands that <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> games like Guitar Hero. Criticism was raised on the use of microtransactions and premium shows, disallowing players to play specific tracks at any time without cost.|$|E
500|$|Previous {{work has}} {{analyzed}} both vocabulary use of typically developing speakers and word use of AAC users to generate content for new AAC devices. [...] Such processes <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> generating a {{core set of}} utterances or vocal expressions but are less effective in situations where a particular vocabulary is needed (for example, terms related directly to a user's interest in horse riding). [...] The term [...] "fringe vocabulary" [...] refers to vocabulary that is specific or unique to the individual's personal interests or needs. [...] A typical technique to develop fringe vocabulary for a device is to conduct interviews with multiple [...] "informants": siblings, parents, teachers, co-workers and other involved persons.|$|E

500|$|Beagles {{are used}} as {{detection}} dogs in the Beagle Brigade of the United States Department of Agriculture. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating {{for people who are}} uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> rewards. They are also used for this purpose {{in a number of other}} countries including by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and in Canada, Japan and the People's Republic of China.* * [...] Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited.|$|E
500|$|Skis {{designed}} for classic technique, both {{in track and}} in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the [...] "grip zone" [...] or [...] "kick zone", underfoot. This comes either from a) texture, designed to slide forward but not backwards, that {{is built into the}} grip zone of waxless skis, or from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or b) from grip waxes. Grip waxes are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax too hard for the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (wax too soft for the conditions). Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction. Hard grip waxes don't <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called klister.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{creators of}} Charlotte are Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, and Charlotte {{is the second}} original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! (2010). Hironori Toba of Aniplex approached Maeda in early 2012 with an offer from P.A.Works president Kenji Horikawa to do another anime series with the studio. Maeda was surprised by this, as he never expected to work with P.A.Works again. Horikawa explained that the production staff could now handle things that {{were not able to}} be fully materialized during the production of Angel Beats!. Maeda did not think he would ever be involved in the planning of another anime series, but {{he said that he had}} no choice but to accept Horikawa's offer after discussing it with him. Toba asked Maeda to write a [...] "Key-like story", and Maeda started out by applying his prior experience of working on Angel Beats!. He went through a trial-and-error process to work out what kind of setting and story would <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> an anime series.|$|E
