5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on August 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed. Based on this, this system <b>was</b> <b>classified</b> as Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on August 16, turned {{a little bit more}} westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E

The system did not strengthen much, and development was halted when wind shear destroyed the system on August 8. The depression never came near land and hence no one was killed or injured.

After Roger Heim and A.Leclair described L.semisanguifluus in 1950, this fungus was referred to as the latter. L.fennoscandicus was separated from L.deterrimus in 1998 by Annemieke T.
