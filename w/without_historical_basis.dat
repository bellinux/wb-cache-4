25|$|Some modern {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} the details of the life of Jesus share similarities to ancient myths and may have been influenced by them, other scholars contend that the analogies are <b>without</b> <b>historical</b> <b>basis.</b> There are also arguments that go the other way, namely that the life story of Jesus as told by early Christians during the second and third centuries gave rise to new religious movements such as Gnosticism.|$|E
25|$|Although modern {{parallels}} between the teachings of Jesus such as the Sermon on the Mount and some Buddhist teachings have been drawn (by the 14th Dalai Lama for example) these comparisons emerged after missionary contacts in the 19th century, {{and there is no}} historically reliable evidence of contacts between Buddhism and Jesus during his life. Modern scholarship has almost unanimously agreed that claims of the travels of Jesus to Tibet, Kashmir or India (see Unknown years of Jesus) and the influence of Buddhism on his teachings are <b>without</b> <b>historical</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, Christian theologians {{have also}} cited the mythic hero {{archetype}} {{as a defense}} of Christian teaching while completely affirming a historical Jesus. Secular academics have {{also pointed out that}} the teachings of Jesus marked [...] "a radical departure from all the conventions by which heroes had been defined". Many mainstream biblical scholars respond that most of these parallels are either coincidences or <b>without</b> <b>historical</b> <b>basis</b> and/or that these parallels do not prove that a Jesus figure did not live.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, modern {{scholarship}} has generally rejected suggestions of an influence from Buddhism on Christianity as fanciful and <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis.</b> Paula Fredriksen states that no serious scholarly work places Jesus outside {{the backdrop of}} 1st-century Palestinian Judaism.|$|R
50|$|A popular {{explanation}} of the name, but <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis,</b> is as follows: two princesses built a castle called Haus Demmin and promised each other (in the Low German language spoken in Demmin) Dat Hus is din und min 'That house is yours (din) and mine (min).' Thus {{the name of the}} castle and of the city is said to have developed.|$|R
50|$|Elements in a {{specific}} culture are not necessarily integrated into a coherent system, and may be contradictory. In the Caribbean, indigenous remedies fall into several classes: certain well-known European medicinal herbs introduced by the early Spaniard colonists that are still commonly cultivated; indigenous wild and cultivated plants, the uses {{of which have been}} adopted from the Amerindians; and ornamental or other plants of relatively recent introduction for which curative uses have been invented <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|R

50|$|Mudrarakshasa ("The signet ring of Rakshasa") is a Sanskrit play by Vishakhadatta. Its date is uncertain, but it anachronistically {{mentions}} the Hunas, who invaded northern India during the Gupta period. Therefore, {{it could not}} have been composed before the Gupta era. It is dated variously from the late 4th century to the 8th century. The Mudrarakshasa legend contains narratives not found in other versions of the Chanakya-Chandragupta legend. Therefore, most of it appears to be pure fiction, <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Harry Watt, who had previously made two feature films in Australia for Ealing. He resigned from the company in 1955 to work for Granada Television, but had not enjoyed the experience and asked to return after eighteen months. Watt came across the script and became enthusiastic about its possibilities. It {{was the only one}} of Watt's three Australian films made <b>without</b> a <b>historical</b> <b>basis</b> and was a deliberate attempt on the director's part to create a commercially successful film.|$|R
50|$|The untrustworthiness of {{the legend}} {{has led some}} recent authors to suggest that Amadour was an unknown hermit or {{possibly}} St. Amator, Bishop of Auxerre, but this is mere hypothesis, <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis.</b> The origin of the sanctuary of Rocamadour, lost in antiquity, is thus set down along with fabulous traditions which cannot bear up to sound criticism. After the religious manifestations of the Middle Ages, Rocamadour, {{as a result of}} war and the French Revolution, had become almost deserted. In the mid-nineteenth century, owing to the zeal and activity of the bishops of Cahors, it seems to have revived.|$|R

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name Bitlis is not known. A popular folk {{etymology}} explanation, <b>without</b> <b>historical</b> <b>basis,</b> {{is that it is}} derived from [...] "Lis/Batlis", the name of a general said to have built Bitlis castle by the order of Alexander the Great. To Armenians, it was known as Balalesa or Baghaghesh, and later Baghesh. According to one popular Armenian folk story, on a cold, wintry day a donkey left its stable and wandered down the valley below. The donkey died of the freezing temperatures and was only discovered in the spring, once the ice had melted; thus, it received the name Pagh Esh, or [...] "Cold Donkey." ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{widespread}} theory, but <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis,</b> is owed to Francisco Javier Borrull. His {{hypothesis is}} that there was already a precedent in Roman times, but its foundation as it operates today occurred during the reigns of the Caliphs Abd-ar-Rahman III and Al-Hakam II, specifically in 960. Borrull's reason was that during the reign of these two Caliphs was an era of complete peace on the Iberian peninsula, and therefore it must have been founded then. In fact, the millennial anniversary of the founding of the Water Tribunal took place in 1960, led by Vicente Giner Boira, legal adviser to the Tribunal at the time, and leading proponent of this theory in the twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|In the Sdok Kăk Thoṃ {{inscription}} {{a member}} of a brahmin family claimed that his ancestors since the time of Jayavarman II (ជ័យវរ្ម័នទី២), who established around 800 CE by marriage to the daughter of a local king in the Angkor region a small realm which became {{at the end of the}} 9th century the famous Khmer Empire, were responsible for the cult of the Devarāja (kamrateṅ jagat ta rāja). Historians formerly dated his reign as running from 802 CE to 850 CE, but these dates are of very late origin (11th century) and <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis.</b> Some scholars now have tried to identify Jayavarman II with Jayavarman Ibis who is known from his inscriptions from Práḥ Thãt Práḥ Srĕi south of Kompoṅ Čàṃ (K. 103, dated 20 April 770) and from Lobŏ’k Srót in the vicinity of Kračèḥ close to the ancient town of Śambhupura (K. 134, dated 781 CE). The Sdok Kăk Thoṃ inscription incised c. 250 years after the events (of which their historicity is doubtful) recounts that on the top of the Kulen Hills, Jayavarman II instructed a brahmin priest named Hiraṇyadāman to conduct a religious ritual known as the cult of the devarāja (ទេវរាជា) which placed him as a cakravartin, universal monarch, a title never heard of before in Cambodia.|$|R
2500|$|In Chapter 58 it is {{suggested}} that the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene created a [...] "potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to the throne." [...] Olson and Meisel not only state that this assertion is <b>without</b> any <b>historical</b> <b>basis,</b> but question why Solomon's kingship would have any purpose or meaning today that would motivate a large-scale conspiracy. The authors also question why if Jesus were merely a [...] "mortal prophet", as the novel suggests, a royal goddess would not have any interest in him. Olson and Meisel quote Chicago archbishop Francis Cardinal George, who remarked, [...] "Jesus isn't God but Mary Magdalene is a goddess? I mean, what does that mean? If he's not God, why is he married to a goddess?" [...] Olson and Meisel also argued that having Davidic blood in Jesus' time would not have been unique, since all of his stepfather Joseph's relatives, which included twenty generations of kings of Judah, had it as well. The authors also state that the Benjamites were not considered [...] "rightful" [...] heirs to the throne, and that the New Testament does not mention Mary Magdalene's tribal affiliation, and that she was likely not from the tribe of Benjamin, and that her connection with that tribe is traced to the 1982 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which does not substantiate the idea.|$|R

40|$|In {{histories}} of Serbian painting Sreten Marić is listed among the protagonists of socialist realism, and {{that on the}} basis of a single article - his criticism of an exhibition staged by the Association of Visual Artists of Serbia to the benefit of wounded veterans (the exhibition was opened in Belgrade in late 1944, and the article was published in the Christmas 1945 issue of „Politika“). <b>Without</b> denying the <b>historical</b> <b>basis</b> for this judgment, the author of the present paper pleads for a more nuance approach and propounds the thesis that socialist realism was primarily a complex pattern of social relations, and only in the second place a substantively defined doctrine. On the basis of an insight into the relevant sources it is argued that Marić was not a theorist of socialist realism; on the other hand, an ideologue of social painting he was indeed, believing in a synthesis of Art and Revolution. By way of comparison, the figures of Miroslav Krleža and Georg Lukács are referred to: neither of the two was a protagonist of socialist realism, though both belonged firmly to the so-called leftist thought...|$|R
