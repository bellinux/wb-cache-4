Even after the storm, finding an exact number of casualties was difficult because all roads in and out of interior sections of the island were impassable, blocked by downed trees and large amounts of <b>washed</b> <b>out</b> <b>soil</b> and rock. For a final death toll, the August 1891Monthly Weather Review states that 700 perished in the storm. However, some newspapers report that the passage of the cyclone resulted in at least 1,000 deaths in Martinique. Additionally, another 1,000people sustained injuries of one form or another {{as a direct result of}} the cyclone. Total damage is estimated at $10million (1891USD).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- Leaching is {{a natural}} process by which water soluble substances, (such as Ca, fertilizers, pesticides) are <b>washed</b> <b>out</b> from <b>soil</b> or wastes. These leached out chemicals, called leachate(s), cause {{pollution}} of surface and subsurface water. Experts in Municipal Solid Waste Management often require conceptualization of the leachability of metals {{in order to assess}} the risk of landfills to human health and environment. Literature identifies more than 100 leaching methods to remove soluble components from a solid matrix. In this study four potential leaching procedures used for municipal solid wastes are studied and compared to suggest the effects of these metals to the environmen...|$|R

5000|$|Morels can be {{preserved}} in several ways: They can be 'flash frozen' by simply running {{under cold water}} or putting them in a bucket to soak for a few minutes, then spread on a baking tray and placed into a freezer. After freezing, they keep very well with the frozen glaze {{for a long time}} in airtight plastic containers. However, when thawed they can sometimes turn slightly mushy, so they are best frozen after steaming or frying. Due to their natural porosity, morels may contain trace amounts of soil which cannot be easily <b>washed</b> <b>out.</b> Any visible <b>soil</b> should be removed with a brush, after cutting the body in half lengthwise, if needed. Mushroom hunters sometimes recommend soaking morels in a bowl of salt water briefly prior to cooking, although many chefs would disagree.|$|R
40|$|The annual use of {{de-icing}} salts {{leads to a}} continuous increase of Cl- and Na+ concentration in the surroundings of treated roads. It particularly affects soil and water environment and vegetation. The Na+ are accumulated in soils, they are bound into the cation exchange complex (CEC). It leads to the displacement of other cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+, NH 4 +, etc.), which are <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> from <b>soils.</b> The excessive amount of Na+ disturbs the soil structure and leads to a soil particles dispersion. Thus, the mobilisation of heavy metals (Cd, Zn, Pb, etc.) can occur. Increase of pH and electrical conductivity (EC) {{has an effect on}} the overall chemistry of the soil. Cl- are more mobile than Na+ in the soil column and they are flushed into water, where they altogether contribute to an increase of total dissolved solids and they cause acute and chronic contamination. The vitality of aquatic communities is influenced by the long-term exposure to the stress conditions. Finally, a shift from alkali to halophytic communities can occur. A slowdown, even stoppage of water layers mixing can be observed in water reservoirs. Biogeochemistry of water sediments is changed due to the anoxia of the benthic waters. Vegetation in the surroundings of treated roads shows visible symptoms of damage. The coniferous trees are [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{filters are}} {{materials}} used to avoid mass transport under seepage flow. They are installed in zoned dams {{or on the}} downstream slope of levees to prevent the <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> of <b>soil</b> particles through {{the core of the}} earth structures or through its foundation. This migration is stopped if the particles are blocked on their pathway by a constriction smaller than their own size. In that sense, the constriction size distribution is closely related to the filtering capability of the granular filter. Different numerical methods exist to study and divide the pore space into local pores and then constrictions. However, they all require a statement of what a local pore is. Al-Raoush et al. (2003) noticed that the partition of the void space may lead to an over-segmentation of the pore space and merging criteria may be used to define more physical local pores. Conversely, merging may require thresholds that may influence the final degree of the segmentation. In this paper, we compare different merging criteria and discuss their implication on both the local pore definition and the constriction sizes statistical distribution. Moreover, since the constriction size distribution is often used in probabilistic approaches for filtration, we insist on the necessary consistency of the choice of a given merging criterion with other possible statements related to these probabilistic approache...|$|R
5000|$|The soil is a {{rich source}} of {{bacterial}} and fungal genera. Common Gram-positive species are those belonging to the Actinomycetales and species of the genera Bacillus, Arthrobacter and Nocardia. Many of these organisms produce and secrete ferrioxamines which lead to growth promotion of not only the producing organisms, but also other microbial populations that are able to utilize exogenous siderophores [...] Soil fungi include Aspergillus and Penicillium which predominately produce ferrichromes. This group of siderophores consist of cyclic hexapeptides and consequently are highly resistant to environmental degradation associated with the wide range of hydrolytic enzymes that are present in humic soil. Soils containing decaying plant material possess pH values as low as 3-4. Under such conditions organisms that produce hydroxamate siderophores have an advantage due to the extreme acid stability of these molecules. The microbial population of fresh water {{is similar to that of}} soil, indeed many bacteria are <b>washed</b> <b>out</b> from the <b>soil.</b> In addition, fresh-water lakes contain large populations of Pseudomonas, Azomonas, Aeromonos and Alcaligenes species.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{transformation}} of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri JM 300 in a non-sterile brown earth microcosm was studied. For this purpose, the microcosm was loaded with purified DNA (plasmid or chromosomal DNA, both containing a high-frequency-transformation marker, hisM, of the P. stutzeri genome), the non-adsorbed DNA was <b>washed</b> <b>out</b> with <b>soil</b> extract and then the soil was charged with competent cells (his- 1). Both chromosomal and plasmid transformants were found among the P. stutzeri cells recovered from the soil. The number of plasmid transformants increased in a linear fashion {{with the amount of}} DNA added [10 – 600 ng (0 < 7 g soil) N 1]. The observed efficiency of transformation, the time course of transformant formation and the complete inhibition of transformation by DNase I, when added to the soil, were similar to that seen in optimized transformations in nutrient broth. Addition of cells as late as 3 d after loading the soil with plasmid DNA still yielded 3 % of the initial transforming activity. This suggests that nucleases indigenous to the soil destroyed the transforming DNA, but at a rate allowing considerable DNA persistence. Transformants were also obtained when intact P. stutzeri cells were introduced into the soil to serve as plasmid DNA donors. Apparently, DNA was released from the cells, adsorbed to the soil material and subsequently taken up by recipient cells. The results indicate that competent cells of P. stutzeri were able to find access to and take up DNA bound on soil particles in the presence of micro-organisms and DNases indigenous to the soil...|$|R

"December 2011 "The development of equations necessary for the analysis of finite bridge approach slabs (BAS) on elastic soil support is reported in this thesis. Results are compared for moments and shear forces governing the design {{for a wide range of}} values of soil elastic modulus ranging from dense sand to very loose sand. Results from systematic studies assuming <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> of <b>soil</b> support are also presented using a customized uniaxial finite-difference model. The influences of wash-out length and location have been discussed. Moreover, the functions of sleeper slab at the pavement end of the conventional design are studied. It is replaced by a modified end-section reinforcement detailing to provide enhanced local two-way action, providing increased flexural rigidity in the direction transverse to the traffic direction. An Excel-based VBA program is developed for application of designing bridge approach slab incorporating partial elastic soil support. Additionally, a biaxial finite-difference model is developed using MATLAB for better understanding the performance of BAS in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Results from uniaxial and biaxial solutions are compared and discussed. Initial construction cost of this new design alternative is computed and presented to demonstrate that the BAS designed with consideration of elastic soil support results in a cost-effective design. Life cycle costs too are competitive if only agency costs are included, for rural traffic demands, this design is the most cost-effective alternatives among those considered...|$|R

Most of the surface of the the park is landbased, and 80 % of this is privately owned. The landscape of the park has been shaped by several glacial advances during the last ice‐age, and consists of coastal cliffs, flat plains and lateral moraine, among others. The areas have been cultivated since the middleage, but around the year 1700, intensive land use was abandoned on the most <b>washed</b> <b>out</b> and sandy <b>soils.</b> Some of these areas have been used for grazing, and today they harbour the naturetype grasslands. The town of Ebeltoft is situated within the limits of the park; and a cultural environment in the shape of an old maltfactory lies within the town. This report seeks to investigate the objectives concerning culture and nature listed in the basis for Mols Bjerge National Park, and try to uncover how differences in interests and views on nature affect the fulfillment of these objectives. We have chosen to take our starting point in two cultural environments, the maltfactory in Ebeltoft, and the grasslands in the core‐area of Mols Bjerge National Park. The investigation is based on theory of views on Side 2 af 81 nature, geografical observation in the two cultural environments as well as interviews with three key persons i relation to the maltfactory and the grasslands.
