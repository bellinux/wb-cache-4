5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
25|$|The progestational {{efficacy}} and potency of dydrogesterone {{was confirmed by}} standard test (i.e. delay of menses and induction of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding).</b> The benefits of estrogen or other target organs are not compromised by dydrogesterone.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{estrogen}} {{replacement therapy}} {{is used to}} spur the growth of secondary sexual characteristics {{at the time when}} puberty should onset. While very few women with Turner Syndrome menstruate spontaneously, estrogen therapy requires a regular shedding of the uterine lining ("withdrawal bleeding") to prevent its overgrowth. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> can be induced monthly, like menstruation, or less often, usually every three months, if the patient desires. Estrogen therapy does not make a woman with nonfunctional ovaries fertile, but it {{plays an important role in}} assisted reproduction; the health of the uterus must be maintained with estrogen if an eligible woman with Turner Syndrome wishes to use IVF (using donated oocytes).|$|E
50|$|A {{version of}} the {{combined}} pill has also been packaged to completely eliminate placebo pills and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds.</b> Marketed as Anya or Lybrel, {{studies have shown that}} after seven months, 71% of users no longer had any breakthrough bleeding, the most common side effect of going longer periods of time without breaks from active pills.|$|R
25|$|Progesterone {{is used in}} {{non-pregnant}} {{women with}} a delayed menstruation {{of one or more}} weeks, in order to allow the thickened endometrial lining to slough off. This process is termed a progesterone <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleed.</b> The progesterone is taken orally for a short time (usually one week), after which the progesterone is discontinued and bleeding should occur.|$|R
30|$|Introduction: In December 2007, at Arrowe Park Hospital, Upton, Wirral, Merseyside, England, endometrial {{preparation}} for M.E.A. (microwave endometrial ablation) was changed from using GnRH analogue injections to using progesterone to induce a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleed.</b> This change in practice was introduced {{as a cost}} saving exercise in line with N.I.C.E. (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines for heavy menstrual bleeding recommendations. Following this change of practice, menstrual outcome and patient satisfaction compared with treatment following GnRH analogue preparation {{has not yet been}} established.|$|R
25|$|In December 1954, Rock {{began the}} first {{studies of the}} ovulation-suppressing {{potential}} of 5–50mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5–25 followed by pill-free days to produce <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding)</b> in fifty of his infertility patients in Brookline, Massachusetts. Norethisterone or noretynodrel 5mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10mg and higher doses of norethisterone or noretynodrel suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding {{and led to a}} 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's noretynodrel for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's norethisterone very slight androgenicity in animal tests.|$|E
500|$|Infrequent or {{irregular}} ovulation {{is called}} oligoovulation. The absence of ovulation is called anovulation. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an anovulatory cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and [...] stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow {{resulting from a}} very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen breakthrough bleeding. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause (perimenopause) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Implanon: [...] Most regimens of COCPs, NuvaRing, and the {{contraceptive}} patch {{incorporate a}} placebo or break week that causes regular <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> [...] While women using combined injectable contraceptives may experience amenorrhea (lack of periods), they typically have predictable bleeding {{comparable to that}} of women using COCPs.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{contraceptive}} counseling {{requires an}} understanding of a woman's preferences and medical history {{as well as the}} risks, benefits, side effects, and contraindications of each contraceptive method. Hormonal contraceptives using a variety of delivery methods are highly effective and this review highlights the new extended-cycle levonorgestrel-ethinyl estradiol contraceptives. Extended-cycle OCPs are unique in offering fewer or no <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds</b> over the course of one year but providers need to carefully counsel women regarding the initial increased breakthrough bleeding. Extended-cycle OCPs may be of particular benefit in women with medical comorbidities who would benefit from less <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds,</b> those desiring to avoid monthly menses due to increased hormonal withdrawal symptoms, or simply women who don't desire a monthly period. The risks associated with all extended-cycle OCPs {{have been found to be}} similar to those of traditional OCPs therefore counseling on the risks and side effects is comparable to that of any combined hormonal contraceptives. Newer extended-cycle regimens shorten or eliminate the hormone-free interval, decrease frequency of menses to four times per year or eliminate menses altogether. This can reduce the risk of common menstrual symptoms, endometriosis, or severe dysmenorrhea by offering potentially greater ovarian suppression and preventing endogenous estradiol production while still providing highly effective, rapidly reversible, and safe contraception...|$|R
40|$|A twenty eight {{year old}} {{nulliparous}} Bahraini lady, presented with four years history of primary infertility and thirteen years history of secondary amenorrhoea. A diagnosis of premature ovarian failure was made. She was advised to take hormonal replacement therapy {{in order to}} get monthly <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds</b> and the dose was adjusted, so as to mimic as closely as possible the ovarian steroid profile in a normal ovulatory cycle. She had two trials of ovarian stimulation but no response was seen. Finally the couple decided to go through with an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment using oocyte donation. Pregnancy resulted and proceeded well. Gestation was terminated at the 33 rd week by caesarean section and two healthy infants were delivered...|$|R
30|$|A 21 -year-old {{nulliparous}} {{woman was}} referred by her general practitioner with a 7 -year history of worsening cyclical LIF pain associated with nausea and vomiting. She menstruated regularly. Although the pain initially responded to tricyclic pills, it later {{changed to a}} constant dull ache with severe exacerbation during <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds.</b> Transvaginal scanning (TVS) showed a left pelvic kidney, a normal uterus and right ovary. The left ovary was not seen. Laparoscopy revealed a right uterine horn communicating with the cervix and vagina. There was a 4  cms non-communicating left uterine horn adherent to the abdominal wall in the LIF, connected to the vagina by a fibrous band. The left adnexa lay in proximity to the uterine horn; the latter was readily removed at laparoscopy with morcellation.|$|R
2500|$|In 1953, at Pincus' suggestion, Rock induced {{a three-month}} {{anovulatory}} [...] "pseudo-pregnancy" [...] state in twenty-seven of his infertility patients with an oral 300mg/day progesterone-only regimen for 20 days from cycle days 5–24 followed by pill-free days to produce <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> This produced the same 15% pregnancy rate {{during the following}} four months without the amenorrhea of the previous continuous estrogen and progesterone regimen. But 20% of the women experienced breakthrough bleeding {{and in the first}} cycle ovulation was suppressed in only 85% of the women, indicating that even higher and more expensive oral doses of progesterone would be needed to initially consistently suppress ovulation.|$|E
2500|$|All {{contain an}} estrogen, {{ethinylestradiol}} or mestranol, in varying amounts, {{and one of}} a number of different progestogens. (Regarding the estrogen, the inactive 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol, which must be metabolized by the liver into the active ethinylestradiol; 50µg of mestranol is equivalent to only 35µg of ethinylestradiol and should not be used when high-dose [...] estrogen pills are needed; mestranol was the estrogen used in the first oral contraceptive, Enovid). They are usually taken for 21 days with then a seven-day gap during which a withdrawal bleed (often, but incorrectly, referred to as a menstrual period) occurs. These differ in the amount of estrogen given, and whether they are monophasic (the same dose of estrogen and progestogen during each of the 21 days) or multiphasic (varying doses). The introduction of extended-cycle monophasic pills (i.e. Seasonale) has shown that the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> intervals can be decreased.|$|E
2500|$|Temporary {{disruption}} of the menstrual cycle is also commonly experienced. If taken before ovulation, the high doses of progestogen in levonorgestrel treatments may induce progestogen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> {{a few days after}} the pills are taken. One study found that about half of women who used levonorgestrel ECPs experienced bleeding within 7 days of taking the pills. If levonorgestrel is taken after ovulation, it may increase the length of the luteal phase, thus delaying menstruation by a few days. Mifepristone, if taken before ovulation, may delay ovulation by 3–4 days (delayed ovulation may result in a delayed menstruation). These disruptions only occur in the cycle in which ECPs were taken; subsequent cycle length is not significantly affected. If a woman's menstrual period is delayed by two weeks or more, it is advised that she take a pregnancy test. (Earlier testing may not give accurate results.) ...|$|E
5000|$|There are no {{specialist}} HRT treatments available {{just for}} women with KS/HH but there are multitude of different HRT {{products on the market}} including oral contraceptives and standard post-menopause products. Pills are popular but patches are also available. It may take some trial and error to find the appropriate HRT for the patient depending on how her body reacts to the particular HRT. Specialist medical advice will be required to ensure the correct levels of oestrogen and progesterone are maintained each month, depending on whether the patient requires continuous HRT (no-bleed) or a withdrawal option to create a [...] "menstrual" [...] type <b>bleed.</b> This <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleed</b> can be monthly or over longer time periods {{depending on the type of}} medication used.|$|R
50|$|Combined oral {{contraceptive}} pills {{should be taken}} {{at the same time}} each day. If one or more tablets are forgotten for more than 12 hours, contraceptive protection will be reduced. Most brands of combined pills are packaged in one of two different packet sizes, with days marked off for a 28-day cycle. For the 21-pill packet, a pill is consumed daily for three weeks, followed by a week of no pills. For the 28-pill packet, 21 pills are taken, followed by a week of placebo or sugar pills. A woman on the pill will have a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleed</b> sometime during the placebo week, and is still protected from pregnancy during this week. There are also two newer combination birth control pills (Yaz 28 and Loestrin 24 Fe) that have 24 days of active hormone pills, followed by 4 days of placebo.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} of infertility, endocrinology and cancer has become clearer in recent years. Polycystic ovaries (PCO) {{increase the risk}} of endometrial cancer. Prolonged amenorrhoea, therefore, should be prevented in such cases with the use of cyclical progestogens, in order for regular <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds</b> to be induced and the endometrium protected from long-term unopposed oestrogen stimulation. There is no secure evidence base on which a relationship between PCO and breast cancer can be based. No specific breast screening for women with PCO is, therefore, recommended. Hyperandrogenaemia and hyperinsulinaemia are conditions whose significance in terms of increasing both endometrial and breast cancer risks is increasingly recognised. The exact mechanism with which they influence carcinogenesis is still far from clear. Whether they act in isolation or as expressions of the common background of the metabolic syndrome - in interaction with other components of this syndrome - is still the subject of research...|$|R
50|$|The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> {{that occurs}} {{during the break}} from active pills {{was thought to be}} reassuring, as a {{physical}} confirmation of not being pregnant. The 28-day pill package also simulates the average menstrual cycle, though the hormonal events during a pill cycle are significantly different from those of a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. The pill suppresses the normal cycle, and the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> occurs while the placebo pills are taken. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> is also predictable. Unexpected breakthrough bleeding can be a possible side effect of longer term active regimens.|$|E
50|$|Most unusual {{bleeding}} or irregular bleeding (metrorrhagia) in premenopausal {{women is}} caused by changes in the hormonal balance of the body. These changes are not pathological. Exceptionally heavy bleeding during menstruation is termed menorrhagia or hypermenorrhea, while light bleeding is called hypomenorrhea. Women on hormonal contraceptives can experience breakthrough bleeding and/or <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> occurs when a hormonal contraceptive or other hormonal intake is discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects of}} NOMAC are {{infrequent}} and may include abnormal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> (usually shorter, lighter,or absent menstruations), headache, and weight gain.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess if endometrial {{thickness}} could be used to select postmenopausal women on hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) at increased risk for endometrial abnormalities. The secondary aim was to assess if endometrial abnormalities were more likely to occur in patients with increased endometrial thickness or in patients with unexpected bleeding. METHODS: Bi-endometrial thickness was measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) in postmenopausal patients on sequential or combined HRT regimens. Women following a sequential regimen underwent TVS examination immediately after their <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleed,</b> always between 5 and 10 days after the last progesterone tablet. A hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy was performed within 5 days after the TVS examination, when endometrial thickness was > or = 4 mm, or when unscheduled bleeding was observed. RESULTS: A total of 190 women were recruited. In 138 women on sequential regimens, the mean value of endometrial thickness was 3. 6 mm +/- 1. 5, and in 52 women on combined regimens it was 3. 2 mm +/- 1. 8 (P = n. s.)

40|$|Postmenopausal {{women were}} {{randomly}} given either oral calcium (500 mg/day, control group, n = 12) {{or a combination}} of estradiol valerate (EV, 2 mg/day for 21 days) with cyproterone acetate (CPA, 1 mg/day in the last 10 days of the treatment cycle, n = 19). EV+CPA reduced (P < 0. 01) postmenopausal complaints, inducing regular <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds,</b> with no hysteroscopic or hystologic evidence of endometrial hyperstimulation after 12 months of treatment. In the control group, spine bone mineral density (BMD) and the total body bone mineral (TBBM) decreased (P < 0. 01), whereas urinary hydroxyproline excretion (OH-P/Cr), plasma bone Gla Protein (BGP) and lipid profile did not show any significant modification throughout the study. In the EV+CPA group, urinary OHP/Cr and plasma BGP levels decreased (P < 0. 01) after 6 and 12 months, whereas both BMD and TBBM showed a small but significant (P < 0. 01) increase. In this group, LDL cholesterol significantly (P < 0. 01) decreased and HDL levels significantly (P < 0. 01) increased after 6 and 12 months.

40|$|Combined oral {{contraceptives}} consist of the steroid hormone oestrogen {{in combination with}} a progestogen, taken primarily to prevent pregnancy. The same hormones {{can also be used}} in other forms for contraception. Combined oral contraceptive pills generally refer to pills in which an oestrogen and a progestogen are given concurrently in a monthly cycle. In contrast, a cycle of sequential oral contraceptive pills includes oestrogen-only pills followed by five to seven days of oestrogen plus progestogen pills. Sequential oral contraceptive pills were removed from the consumer market in the late 1970 s; they are covered in an IARC monograph (IARC, 1979, 1987). Combined {{oral contraceptives}} are thus usually administered as a pill containing oestrogen and progestogen, which is taken daily for 20 – 22 days, followed by a seven-day pill-free interval (or seven days of placebo), during which time a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleed</b> is expected to occur. The most commonly used oestrogen is ethinyloestradiol, although mestranol is used in some formulations. The progestogens most commonly used in combined oral contraceptives are derived from 19 -nortestosterone and include norethisterone, norgestrel and levonorgestrel, although many others are available (Kleinman, 1990) (see Annex 2, Table 1) ...|$|R

50|$|The test is {{performed}} by administering progesterone either as an intramuscular injection or oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). If {{the patient has}} sufficient serum estradiol (greater than 50 pg/mL), <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> should occur 2-7 days after the progestin is withdrawn, indicating that the patient's amenorrhea is due to anovulation. However, if no bleeding occurs after progesterone withdrawal, then the patient's amenorrhea {{is likely to be}} due to either a) low serum estradiol, b) hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, c) a nonreactive endometrium or d) a problem with the uterine outflow tract, such as cervical stenosis or uterine synechiae (Asherman's syndrome). In order to distinguish between hypoestrogenism or a uterine outflow tract problem/nonreactive endometrium, estrogen may be administered followed by a course of progestin in order to induce <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding.</b> If the patient experiences <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeding</b> with the combined estrogen/progestin therapy, then the amenorrhea is likely due to low estrogen.|$|E

40|$|Anne Burke Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USAAbstract: Oral {{contraceptives}} {{remain a}} popular {{method of contraception}} over 50 years after their introduction. While safe and effective for many women, the failure rate of oral contraception is about 8 %. Concerns {{about the risk of}} venous thromboembolism continue to drive the search for the safest oral contraceptive formulations. The oral contraceptive NOMAC-E 2 contains nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) 2. 5 mg + 17 b-estradiol (E 2) 1. 5 mg. The approved dosing regimen is 24 days of active hormone, followed by a 4 -day hormone-free interval. NOMAC is a progestin derived from testosterone, which has high bioavailability, rapid absorption, and a long half-life. Estradiol, though it has a lower bioavailability, has been successfully combined with NOMAC in a monophasic oral contraceptive. Two recently published randomized controlled trials demonstrate that NOMAC-E 2 is an effective contraceptive, with a Pearl Index less than one pregnancy per 100 woman-years. The bleeding pattern on NOMAC-E 2 is characterized by fewer bleeding/spotting days, shorter <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds,</b> and a higher incidence of amenorrhea than the comparator oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. The adverse event profile appears to be acceptable. Few severe adverse events were reported in the randomized controlled trials. The most common adverse events were irregular bleeding, acne, and weight gain. Preliminary studies suggest that NOMAC-E 2 {{does not seem to have}} negative effects on hemostatic and metabolic parameters. While no one oral contraceptive formulation is likely to be the optimum choice for all women, NOMAC-E 2 is a formulation with effectiveness comparable with that of other oral contraceptives, and a reassuring safety profile.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to compare between clomiphene citrate (CC) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist-based protocols in donor-recipient cycles {{in terms of}} parameters of ovarian stimulation and obstetric outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and three fertile oocyte donors were stimulated using two different protocols: Clomiphene based (n = 103) and antagonist based (n = 100). Donors in the one group were stimulated from day 1 or 2 of spontaneous or <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleeds</b> with CC (50 mg/day) and recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) till the day of trigger while donors in the other group were stimulated using recombinant FSH from day 1 or 2, and the antagonist was added as per flexible antagonist protocol. When > 3 follicles were > 17 mm in diameter, trigger was given with 2 mg leuprolide intramuscular. Transvaginal oocyte retrieval was done after 34 h of trigger. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in between the two groups in terms of age, antral follicle count, starting dose of gonadotropins, total dose required, duration of stimulation, number of follicles retrieved, mature follicles, and fertilization rate. The serum estradiol levels were significantly raised in the clomiphene group (P < 0. 001). Pregnancy rate was similar in both the groups. The clinical pregnancy rate was 65. 94 % in the clomiphene group and 57. 46 % in the antagonist group. The live birth rate per cycle started was 47. 8 % in the clomiphene group and 39. 55 % in the antagonist group. There was one case of ectopic pregnancy in the antagonist group. CONCLUSION: Controlled ovarian stimulation using clomiphene and gonadotropin is a viable option for donor oocyte cycles. The cost and number of injections used per cycle can be reduced by using the clomiphene-based protocols...|$|R

40|$|Tamoxifen (tam) is used {{extensively}} {{for treatment of}} patients with breast cancer and is being evaluated for chemoprevention in healthy women. It has, however, been reported to {{increase the risk of}} endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women, probably by an oestrogenic effect on the endometrium. It also causes endometrial cysts and polyps. The aims of this study were to identify the incidence of endometrial thickening, polyps and cysts by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) screening of a population of post-menopausal healthy women in the Royal Marsden tamoxifen chemoprevention trial and to evaluate the possible benefit from the use of intermittent norethisterone (NE) in women with persistent changes. Since 1990, we have undertaken regular TVUS, using an endovaginal B mode probe, of the 463 post-menopausal women in the trial randomized to tam (20 mg day(- 1)) or placebo (plac), without breaking the randomization code. Endometrial thickening (ET) was defined as > or = 8 mm at the widest point across the myometrial cavity in the longitudinal plane, including any stromal changes. Cystic changes were defined as more than one hypoechogenic area > 1 mm. Polyps were identified using saline hydrosonography. Oral NE (2. 5 mg day(- 1)) was used for 21 days out of 28 for three consecutive cycles by women with persistent endometrium > or = 8 mm, including cystic and polypoid changes. TVUS was repeated after the three courses to evaluate any change caused by NE and endometrial biopsies, including hysteroscopy, was performed on those women with persistent abnormalities. A persistent ET > or = 8 mm was identified in 56 (24 %) of the 235 women on tamoxifen compared with only 5 (2 %) of 228 women on placebo (P < 0. 0005). Stromal changes, including cysts, were detected in 36 (15 %) and polyps in 26 (11 %) of the women on tamoxifen compared with only two (< 1 %) of the women on placebo (P << 0. 0005). After 3 months of cyclical norethisterone, 39 of 47 women (83 %) on tamoxifen had persistent ultrasound changes. However, 45 (96 %) had a progesterone <b>withdrawal</b> <b>bleed.</b> Hysteroscopy was performed in 39 women on tamoxifen (28 endometrial biopsy, 15 polypectomy), five of whom had histological evidence of a proliferative endometrium and a further three had an atypical hyperplastic endometrium (one of whom had a focus of invasive carcinoma). The cysts and polyps which were detected in women on tam could not be reversed by NE and were presumably stromal and not of malignant risk. However, 96 % of the women had <b>withdrawal</b> NE <b>bleeding,</b> indicating an oestrogenically primed endometrium which could be a mechanism for an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Further studies are required to ascertain whether a progestin would protect against this risk.
