5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 {{people with diabetes}} annually. Rates among those <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 1 diabetes, but in those <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{are either}} {{directly}} caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing {{a common cause}} such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. The strength {{of the link between}} obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes.

5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 1 {{diabetes}}, but can also occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E
5|$|Rates of DKA {{vary around}} the world. In the United Kingdom, about 4% of people <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 1 {{diabetes}} develop DKA each year, while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. DKA was first described in 1886 and, until {{the introduction of}} insulin therapy in the 1920s, it was almost universally fatal. The risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is currently around 1–4%. Up to 1% of children with DKA develop a complication known as cerebral edema.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E

She went on to have a recurring role on the long-running primetime serial Knots Landing.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{decreases}} {{high blood}} sugar, primarily by suppressing liver glucose production (hepatic gluconeogenesis). The average patient <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes has {{three times the}} normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. The molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed, including; inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut microbiota.|$|E

5|$|NSB uses Gardermobanen for {{express and}} some {{regional}} trains north of Oslo. This includes five daily departures to Trondheim (including one NSB Night Train). The line is operated by two regional services, the R10 service between Drammen and Lillehammer, the R11 service between Skien/Larvik and Eidsvoll, {{as well as}} the local service, L12 between Kongsberg and Eidsvoll. These services is carried out <b>with</b> <b>Type</b> 74 for R10 and R11, and Type 75 for line L12. Both trains are capable of 200km/t operation. The southernmost part of the line is used by commuter trains heading to the Kongsvinger Line. These trains divert from the Gardermo Line at Lillestrøm. Also the commuter trains operating to Dal along the Hoved Line use the Gardermoen Line until Lillestrøm.|$|E
5|$|The {{likelihood}} of developing paralytic polio increases with age, {{as does the}} extent of paralysis. In children, nonparalytic meningitis {{is the most likely}} consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases. In children under five years of age, paralysis of one leg is most common; in adults, extensive paralysis of the chest and abdomen also affecting all four limbs—quadriplegia—is more likely. Paralysis rates also vary depending on the serotype of the infecting poliovirus; the highest rates of paralysis (one in 200) are associated with poliovirus type 1, the lowest rates (one in 2,000) are associated <b>with</b> <b>type</b> 2.|$|E

In addition Tokiwa was fitted <b>with</b> <b>Type</b> 3, Mark 1, Model 3 and Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radars.

5|$|This {{species was}} first {{recognised}} in 1783 by the German, August Batsch, as Agaricus flammans, and later sanctioned by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum. The specific epithet flammans is a Latin adjective meaning flaming. In 1871, with {{the recognition of}} Pholiota as an independent genus <b>with</b> <b>type</b> species Pholiota squarrosa, another German, Paul Kummer renamed the fungus Pholiota flammans. Lucien Quélet, a French mycologist, proposed another synonym, Dryophila flammans in 1886.

5|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} bleeding disorder found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by a}} lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition <b>with</b> <b>Type</b> I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|E
