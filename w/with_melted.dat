To procure pemmican in sufficient quantities, the NWC traded for it at several outposts in the Red River District and transported it to their Bas de la Rivière depot on Lake Winnipeg where it was distributed to brigades of north canoes passing between Fort William and Athabasca or transported to Fort William where it was issued to brigades going to the company’s eastern and southern districts.

2500|$|Such {{cast lead}} bullets, {{intended}} for use with a gas check, will have a reduced diameter {{at the rear of}} the cast lead bullet, onto which the gas check can be swaged using a lubricating/resizing press. [...] All cast lead bullets, whether with or without a gas check, must still be lubricated, to prevent leading of the rifling of the barrel. [...] A lubricating/resizing press, which is a special purpose bullet processing press, can be either a standalone press dedicated to lubricating and resizing bullets, or can be an add-on to a reloading press, at the option of the handloader. [...] Not all handloaders resize cast lead bullets, although all handloaders do lubricate cast lead bullets. [...] An option to using a lubricating press is simply to coat the bullets with bullet lube, which can be done either with a spray, in a tumbler, in a plastic bowel with a liquid lube, in a tray <b>with</b> <b>melted</b> bullet lube, or even with a manual lubricating process.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{potatoes}} {{have become}} one of the most widely consumed crops and thus have a variety of preparation methods and condiments.
