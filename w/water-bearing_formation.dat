30|$|The {{chemistry}} of the groundwater {{is crucial for}} understanding the hydrogeological conditions of an aquifer. The present hydrogeological setting of the perched aquifer indicates that it behaves as an unconfined aquifer. The mean pH value of 7.6 of the studied samples greatly exceeds that of rainwater (pH 6.1, Table  4). This {{is a result of}} several chemical reactions within the unsaturated zone as well as a long residence time in the fissured limestone aquifer. The local precipitation {{is believed to be the}} dominant source of recharge. The total dissolved solids (TDS) of the studied groundwater vary between 2, 126 and 2, 644  mg/L, meaning that the perched groundwater is mainly brackish. The lithologic properties of the aquifer affect the type and concentration of the different dissolved solids (Table  4). The sequences of the ions show no variation in the chemical composition of the water, which is mainly controlled by the lithology of the recharging and the discharging area as well as the lithology of the <b>water-bearing</b> <b>formation.</b> The ion dominance in the studied groundwater follows the sequence Cl− > SO 42 − > HCO 3 − and Na+ > Mg 2 + > Ca 2 +.

40|$|Pore surface {{properties}} control oil recovery. This {{is especially true}} for chalk reservoirs, where pores are particularly small. Wettability, the tendency for a surface to cover itself with fluid, is traditionally defined by the angle a droplet makes with a surface, but this macroscopic definition is meaningless when the particles are smaller than even the smallest droplet. Understanding surface wetting, at the pore scale, will provide clues for more effective oil recovery. We used a special mode of atomic force microscopy and a hydrophobic tip to collect matrices of 10, 000 force curves over 5 - × 5 -μm 2 areas on internal pore surfaces and constructed maps of topography, adhesion, and elasticity. We investigated chalk samples from a <b>water-bearing</b> <b>formation</b> in the Danish North Sea oil fields that had never seen oil. Wettability and elasticity were inhomogeneous over scales of 10 s of nanometers, smaller than individual chalk particles. Some areas were soft and hydrophobic, whereas others showed no correlation between hardness and adhesion. We conclude that the macroscopic parameter, “wetting,” averages the nanoscopic behavior along fluid pathways, and “mixed-wet” samples have patches with vastly different properties. Development of reservoir hydrophobicity has been attributed to infiltrating oil, but these new results prove that wettability and elasticity are inherent properties of chalk. Their variability, even on single particles, must result from material originally present during sedimentation or material sorbed from the pore fluid some time later...|$|E

The large withdrawals of artesian water for irrigation result in a considerable decline of the artesian head {{in the western part of}} the county. This seasonal decline of the artesian head has become larger as the withdrawal of artesian water has increased.

On the other hand, water level rising was observed in the same period reaching up to 10  m in the northwestern part due to seepage from the irrigation channel. Petrophysical properties of the studied aquifers were estimated from well logs. The formation water resistivity (Rw) averages 15. 2  ohm m whereas the formation factor (F) averages 5. 1. The averages of the total porosity, the effective porosity and permeability are 36. 5 %, 33. 1 % and 1126. 3  mdarcy, respectively. In addition, the gamma ray logs were used to estimate the volume share of shale which showed an average value reached about 34. 6 %. Total porosity, effective porosity and permeability showed an increasing trend to the northwestern direction where the recharge area is located. The concentrations of TDS and the dissolved elements are higher in the shallow groundwater compared to the deeper one, which could be related to soil salinity and evaporation processes. Ion exchange, water–rock interaction and evaporation processes are the main geochemical processes affecting the chemistry of the studied groundwater. Sodium chloride/bicarbonate types are the most common chemical types in the study area. Most of the water samples are of old meteoric origin (Na 2 SO 4 type) and old marine origin (MgCl 2 type).

40|$|The {{investigation}} here reported, which {{covered a}} period of about 5 years, 1929 to 1933, was made for the purpose of determining the available supply of ground water in south-central Nebraska, the origin and discharge of the ground water, and the relation of the geologic and ground-water conditions in the Platte River Valley to the conditions occurring under the plains to the south. The area was found to be underlain by permeable Pleistocene and Tertiary sand. and gravel, much of which is saturated and yields relatively large quantities of water to wells. Except in a few isolated places the ground-water supply is abundant. The Pleistocene and Tertiary formations were found in many places to be continuous across the area, but they thin out and disappear near the southern and southeastern boundary of the area. A part of the ground water occurring in south-central Nebraska percolates into the area from the sand-hill region of north-central Nebraska through the permeable <b>water-bearing</b> <b>formations.</b> Ground water is also derived from precipitation on the area and from seepage from streams entering the area from the west and northwest. Some of the ground water of the area is discharged into streams, especially in the southern and eastern parts of the area, and some ground water is used by plants, chiefly in the valleys of the streams. Almost all the public, domestic, industrial, and stock water supplies of the area are derived from wells, and in the Platte River Valley about 800 wells are used for irrigation.

The purposes {{of the study were}} to ascertain the characteristics, thickness, and extent of the <b>water-bearing</b> <b>formations</b> and to obtain and interpret data on the origin, quality, quantity, movement, availability, and use of ground water in the area. The rocks exposed in the drainage basin are the Brule formation of Oligocene (Tertiary) age, the Ogallala formation of Pliocene (Tertiary) age, and alluvium of Pleistocene and Recent (Quaternary) age. The Brule formation is mainly a siltstone, which yields an average of 950 gallons per minute (gpm) to irrigation wells tapping its fractured zones or reworked material; the maximum reported discharge is 2, 200 gpm. The Ogallala formation underlies most of the area. It consists of lenticular beds of clayey, silty, sandy, and gravelly materials and supplies water to all wells on the upland, including a few large-discharge wells, and to many irrigation and public-supply wells in the valley of Lodgepole Creek. The yield of irrigation wells tapping the Ogallala formation ranges from 90 to 1, 600 gpm and averages about 860 gpm. The alluvium is present in the valleys of Lodgepole Creek and its tributaries and consists mainly of heterogeneous. mixtures of silt, sand, and gravel, and lenticular bodies of these materials. Between the Colorado State line and Chappell, Nebr., irrigation wells derive most of their water from the alluvium. However, between Chappell and Sidney most of the irrigation wells tap both the alluvium and permeable zones in the underlying Brule formation, and in much of the valley west of Sidney, where the water table is beneath the bottom of the alluvium, irrigation wells derive water from the underlying Brule or Ogallala formations. Irrigation wells obtaining water chiefly from the alluvium have a yield ranging from 130 to 1, 200 gpm, averaging about 770 gpm. In the Lodgepole Creek valley below Sidney the depth to water generally is less than 20 feet and, in many places, less than 10. In much of this part of the area the water table extends to the land surface or to the root zone of the vegetation, and discharge by evapotranspiration is high. In the valley of Lodgepole Creek between Sidney and the Wyoming State line, the depth to water generally ranges from less than 10 feet near the stream to more than 100 {{along the edge of the}} valley. In the upland the depth to water ranges from about 80 to about 300 feet...|$|R
30|$|The present work {{includes}} {{a group of}} studies which deal with geomorphology, geology, hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, remote sensing {{and the application of}} geographical information systems (GIS). The field studies comprised geomorphologic and geological mapping, surveying of water points, and the collection of groundwater samples and core samples from recently drilled wells. Some wells were drilled during field work (August 2009). The hydrogeologic data were obtained and measured during the field trip (such as; depth to water, total depth, <b>water-bearing</b> <b>formations</b> and hydro-geomorphologic units). Topographic maps with different scales and the geologic map were used during field investigations to demarcate the main landforms and structural elements with their relevancy for groundwater occurrence. A total of five groundwater samples and two samples of rainfall and sea water were analyzed in the central laboratory of Desert Research Center (DRC) according to methods of the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) (2002). Carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, calcium and magnesium ions were determined volumetrically, while sodium and potassium were measured by flame photometer, and sulphate was measured by UV/V spectrophotometer. The hydrogen number (pH) and electrical conductivity (EC) of water samples were measured by pH and EC meter, respectively. The obtained data represent the main input to the PHREEQC model (Parkhurst and Appelo 1999, USGS), in order to discuss water–rock interactions. PHREEQC is a computer program (the model was used through AQUACHEM software version 3.7) that was designed to perform a variety of geochemical calculations based on ions association. GeoCover Landsat image mosaics (2000), obtained from NASA as compressed color imagery in MrSID TM file format (resolution 14.25  m, [URL] were used in addition to the geologic map (1 : 500, 000, Conoco 1986) and field investigations to identify the geology of the study area. Data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM, 90  m, [URL] launched in February 2000, were used along with the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM, 28.5  m, [URL] to create a mosaic Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the whole northwestern coast of Egypt (compare e.g., Bubenzer and Bolten 2008). DEM and Landsat images were first reprojected and subset to the study area in ERDAS IMAGINE (ver. 9.3), then imported into the ESRI ArcMap GIS software package (ver. 9.3). Since the spatial distribution of groundwater depends on the geomorphic and hydrological characteristics of the area, we used an indirect approach of hydro-geomorphological investigation. The ASTER GDEM was used within Arc Hydro (Maidment 2002) to produce multi-hydro layers such as drainage channels, catchment areas and stream orders, which were useful in the discussion of surface runoff and its relation to the groundwater recharge. All subsequent analyses and generation of maps were performed in ArcMap, ArcScene and Surfer software. The hydrogeological cross sections were generated by combining subsurface data provided from the wells’ lithology and surface geology with the assistance of Global Mapper software. These cross sections provided results clarifying the mechanisms of recharge and the factors which control groundwater occurrence.|$|R

Gas-, oil- and <b>water-bearing</b> Upper Jurassic <b>formations</b> (Malm) in {{the area}} of the Carpathian Foothills are built from {{carbonate}} reservoir rocks with vuggy-fracture porosity system (or fracture-vuggy), which absolute porosity is from a few to several percent. At the end of the twentieth century DST tests provided a lot of reliable reservoir information, on which the important decisions for geological research and exploration, can be taken. The credibility of these tests results depends largely on the technology used. The paper presents the results of three selected DST tests, differing in technology, particularly with attention to the usefulness of the obtained information in explorations for hydrocarbon deposits process.

40|$|The Barton Springs {{salamander}} was federally {{listed as}} {{an endangered species}} on May 30, 1997 (62 FR 23377 - 23392) by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or the Service) based on the following threats: (1) degradation of the water quality in Barton Springs {{as a result of}} urban expansion, (2) decreased quantity of water that feeds Barton Springs as a result of urban expansion, (3) modification of the salamander’s structural habitat, (4) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to protect the salamander and lack of a comprehensive plan to protect the Barton Springs watershed from increasing threats to water quality and quantity, and (5) the salamander’s extreme vulnerability to environmental degradation because of its restricted range in an entirely aquatic environment. USFWS is the branch of the Department of Interior responsible for listing endangered amphibians, such as the Barton Springs salamander. The extent to which any these threats is considered to predominate is unknown and presumably their cumulative effect may be of primary concern. D. 2 Description and Taxonomy The Barton Springs salamander (Figure D. 1) {{is a member of the}} Family Plethodontidae (lungless salamanders). Texas species within the genus Eurycea inhabit springs, springruns, and <b>water-bearing</b> karst <b>formations</b> of the Edwards Aquifer (Chippindale, 1993). These salamanders are aquatic and neotenic, meaning they retain a larval, gill-breathing morphology throughout their lives. Neotenic salamanders, including the Barton Springs salamander, do not metamorphose into a terrestrial form. Rather, they live their entire life cycle in water, where they become sexually mature and eventually reproduce...|$|R
40|$|The area {{described}} in this report includes the eastern, or lower, end of the valley of Pumpkin Creek and is in Morrill and Banner Counties, in western Nebraska. A reconnaissance of the geology and ground-water resources of the area was made to determine the possibilities of developing ground-water supplies for irrigation. Rocks that crop out in the Pumpkin Creek area are shown on a geologic map that {{is included in the}} report. They range in age from Oligocene to Recent and consist of the Brule, Arikaree, and Ogallala formations and of the alluvium. The Chadron formation, of Oligocene age, underlies the area but is not exposed at the surface. The Lance formation, of Late Cretaceous age, underlies the Chadron formation. Sandstones, which are thought to be in the Lance formation, contain ground water under artesian pressure and might yield sufficient water for irrigation on a small scale. Several thousand feet of Pierre shale, which is not known to yield appreciable quantities of water to wells, underlies the Lance formation. In some places sufficient water for irrigation can be obtained by wells from fractures in the Brule formation. Large supplies of water can be expected in places where the fractures are extensive or where they are overlain by saturated alluvial material. A few springs that are fed by recharge from the upland area issue at the contact of the Brule and Arikaree formations. The Ogallala formation yields water to domestic and stock wells in the upland areas south of Pumpkin Creek valley. Inasmuch as this formation is high topographically and is well drained, the depth to water is considerable generally 100 ft or more and the thickness of the saturated material probably is not great. It is doubtful, therefore, that sufficient water for irrigation could be obtained from this material; however, it may be possible in some places to obtain water for irrigation on a small scale. Alluvium, which underlies the floodplains of Pumpkin Creek and some of its major tributaries, is the principal aquifer in the area. The alluvium of Quaternary age consists of coarse sand and gravel and yields sufficient water for irrigation. In most places yields of 1, 000 to 2, 000 gpm probably could be obtained from properly constructed wells in this material. It is estimated that about 21, 000 acre-ft of ground water annually leaves the area as stream flow. This represents approximately the amount of additional ground water available for development; however, if sufficient ground water is pumped to lower the water table appreciably, the additional water salvaged from loss by evaporation and transpiration also would be available for irrigation use. The development of any additional ground water from the unconfined ground-water reservoir will cause a reduction in the flow of Pumpkin Creek. Water from the alluvium and the Brule formation is moderately mineralized. Although most water is hard, some soft water is obtained from the Brule. The dissolved solids in water from the Brule formation and the alluvium ranged from 236 to 356 ppm. Hardness in these two <b>water-bearing</b> <b>formations</b> ranged from 6. 0 to 20 k ppm. Water obtained from deep wells in the Lance formation is more mineralized and softer than water obtained from the overlying formations. The dissolved solids, which consist largely of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, range from 812 to 1, 170 ppm. Although the water from the Lance formation is satisfactory for domestic needs, the high percentage of sodium restricts its use for irrigation...|$|R
40|$|Modification of {{existing}} oilfield infrastructure could deliver a cost-effective way {{to extend the}} economic life of depleted onshore oilfields. Naturally warm connate and injection water contained within these fields could be initially co-produced with remaining oil reserves and used to deliver clean, cheap, non-intermittent heating. The East Midlands Petroleum Province contains over 30 fields with a production history spanning 95 [*]years, and we have chosen to examine the Welton field in detail. Well data for the Welton field have been analysed to ascertain extractable heat within both oil- and non-oil-bearing (water-bearing) strata within the field. Production rates were calculated to be 728 [*]m 3 [*]d− 1 oil and 854 [*]m 3 [*]d− 1 water. These values also include productivity of intervening largely <b>water-bearing</b> intervals. Target <b>formation</b> temperature at 1500 [*]m {{was determined to be}} 52. 5 °C, allowing an extractable heat energy calculation to be undertaken for a range of temperature differentials. For a 30 °C depletion in temperature, 1. 6 [*]MWt extractable heat is available within the Welton field alone. This equates to 14040 [*]MWh of heat energy available for consumption by the domestic market or within commercial greenhouses...|$|R
