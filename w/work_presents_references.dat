40|$|AbstractThe {{so-called}} a posteriori {{approach to}} optimization with multiple conflicting objective functions is to compute or approximate a Pareto front of solutions. In case of continuous objective functions a finite approximation to this set can be computed. Indicator-based multiobjective optimization algorithms compute solution sets that are optimal {{with respect to}} some quality measure on sets, such as the commonly used hypervolume indicator (HI). The HI measures {{the size of the}} space that is dominated by a given set of solutions. It has many favorable monotonicity properties but it requires a reference point the choice of which is often done ad-hoc. In this study the concept of set monotonic functions for dominated subsets is introduced. Moreover, this <b>work</b> <b>presents</b> a <b>reference</b> point free hypervolume indicator that uses a density that is derived from the user's preferences expressed as desirability functions. This approach will bias the distribution of the approximation set towards a set that more densely samples highly desirable solutions of the objective space. We show that the Harrington type and the Derringer-Suich type of desirability functions yield definite integrals and that the Harrington type has also the favorable property to provide a set-monotonic function over the set of dominated subspaces. It is shown that for a product type of aggregation the weighted hypervolume indicator is mathematically equivalent with an approach that computes the standard hypervolume indicator after transformation of the axes. In addition a probabilistic interpretation of desirability functions is discussed and how a correlation parameter can be introduced in order to change the aggregation type. Finally, practical guidelines for using the discussed set indicator in multiobjective search, for instance when searching for interesting subsets from a database, are provided...|$|R

One of the aspects covered in EA is associated with the organizations active structure, which concerns who undertakes organizational activities.

Despite the acceptance by the community, existing approaches focus on different purposes, have limitations on their conceptual scopes and some have no real world semantics well-defined. Besides modeling approaches, many ontology approaches have been proposed in order to describe the active structure domain, including the ontologies in the SUPER Project, TOVE, Enterprise Ontology and W 3 C Org Ontology.

40|$|Surface waves play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} propagation of vibrations caused by blasting. Indeed, active and passive surface wave tests, which are widely used techniques in engineering and geophysical exploration to infer model parameters for soils and rocks, can be profitably applied for the prediction of ground motion from blasting supplying relevant information on subsurface mechanical properties and source parameters (patterns of propagation and dominant wavelengths). In this respect, monitoring systems for ground vibrations can be conceived in order to use the collected data also for ground characterization purposes. Moreover, the interpretation of surface wave data can lead to an estimate of shear modulus and damping ratio (quality factor) as a function of depth. This information can be used to build a numerical model to simulate wave propagation and predict ground vibrations evaluating the performances of vibration mitigation systems. For preliminary assessments of ground vibrations induced by blasting, the information from surface wave tests can be used to improve the predictive capability of attenuation relationships.

The comprehensive and thoroughly up-to-date handbook presents the sources, identification, analysis, biosynthesis, biotechnology and applications of important polysaccharides likes starches, cellulose, chitin, gum and microbial polysaccharides. Polysaccharides can exhibit complex structure and various functional activities. These bio macromolecules can therefore serve as raw materials for various different materials, e. g. rayon, cellulose acetate, celluloid and nitrocellulose; and they find multiple applications, for instance as surgical threads (chitin), as sources of energy, dietary fibers, as blood flow adjuvants, in cosmetics, emulsion stabilizers, film formers, binders, viscosity increasing agents or skin conditioning agenta, as food additives in gums, chewing gum bases and as vaccines. Polysaccharides form the basis for useful products, like xanthan gum, dextran, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and pullulan. Some of the polysaccharide-derived products have interesting and useful properties and show biological activities, such as immunomodulatory, antibacterial, anti-mutagenic, radioprotective, anti-oxidative, anti-ulcer, antidepressant, anti-septicaemic or anti-inflammatory activities.

Once some stable {{solutions}} {{appear to}} be found at physical and network layers for cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), deploying vehicular services and managing their operation over a common framework is becoming a key issue.
