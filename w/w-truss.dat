40|$|Structural {{design is}} today {{concerned}} with single component performance where each limit state {{is related to}} a single mode of failure of a single component. Further, in limit state codes the strength variables are related to a deterministic value (usually the 5 -percentile). However, in a structure {{with a number of}} elements, two different effects (called system effects) can be found: The probabilistic system effect that is based on the reduced probability that weak sections coincide with the most stressed sections. Structural load-sharing that is the ability to redistribute load between members. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulations of a timber <b>W-truss</b> with punched metal plate fasteners (nail plates) are performed. Structural timber displays a significant variability in strength and stiffness both within and between members and is described by a statistic model calibrated against data from Norway spruce (Picea abies). Most studies found in the literature are based on linear-elastic theory and the variability within members is neglected mainly because of lack of data. The FE calculations are performed by TrussLab - a toolbox for MATLAB developed at Aalborg University. TrussLab considers contact between timber members and non-linear behaviour of the joints. The timber members are given linear properties. The system effect is based on reliability analyses. The system effect found depends on the coefficient of variation, the distribution of the random load variable and the reliability level. Depending on the assumptions, the system effect was found to be in the range 8 - 25 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{performed}} research presented in this thesis {{is to increase the}} understanding of the effect of variability of strength properties on the reliability of timber structural systems. Compared to other structural materials such as steel and concrete, structural timber has a considerably higher variability of strength both within and between members. The advantage of the low probability that high stresses coincide with low strengths is however not accounted for and may give an extra safety margin. The strength of timber members will, due to their inhomogeneous nature, be dependent on both the length of the member and the type of loading. For structures with pronounced moment peaks such as roof trusses, an important increase in safety could therefore be expected. This can be quantified with a system effect factor defined as a multiplier on the single member strength. A statistical model by Isaksson (1999) was used to model the strength variability between but also within timber members of spruce (Picea Abies). Two different types of common timber structural systems were studied namely the <b>W-truss</b> and a parallel, sheathed timber system. The probabilistic system effect was simulated for a roof truss using both a linear elastic model and a non-linear elastic model for the joints. The engineering practice where the bending strength is increased at moment peaks was concluded {{to be on the safe}} side. The system effect for this system was found to be in the range 8 % to 25 % dependent on the assumptions. It was also concluded that the introduction of non-linear behaviour of the joints apparently does not influence the system effect factor, at least not for the studied roof truss. A sheathed parallel timber beam structure was simulated and the system effect was determined. The failure load for the system was calculated for the weakest T-section in the system as well as the system failure load. At 5 th percentile (characteristic) level the ratio between the failure load of the system and the weakest T-section in the system was calculated. The ratio was found to be in the range 1. 19 to 1. 30 depending on the studied parameters. The COV of the system strength was found to be around 10 % compared to the COV of the bending strength of single beams of around 20 %. A new method to evaluate the system reliability was suggested which reduces the effect of the system size. The system effect factor that can be introduced in deterministic calculation is the ratio between the load factor of the single element and the load factor that is applied on the system. The system effect factor was found in the range 1. 17 to 1. 27 for the input data studied...|$|E
