40|$|Abstract: The {{problems}} of environmental pollutions and resources depletion {{have been growing}} issues in global construction recently. Efforts to reduce CO 2 emission have been also made in all sectors of construction industry these days. As {{one of the biggest}} industries that consume a huge amount of resources and generate complex construction <b>wastes,</b> the construction industry has significant impacts on environment issues. However, systematic approach to manage <b>wastes</b> has been rarely made, and most construction <b>wastes</b> from construction sites are being land-filled or incinerated. In this study, a system is proposed to predict the amount of <b>wastes</b> in visual formats, and to control the process of <b>wastes</b> management. The system’s main functions include: (1) to estimate the amount of <b>wastes</b> to be generated in project schedule, (2) to categorize the types of <b>wastes,</b> (3) to determine the timing of taking out <b>wastes</b> from sites, and (4) to share information regarding <b>wastes</b> for recycling. A huge amount of <b>wastes</b> are generated in construction process, but most of the <b>wastes</b> have been discharged in forms of mixed <b>wastes,</b> which make them hardly reused. The system not only provide information on <b>wastes</b> to be generated, but also prevent mixing various <b>wastes</b> by classifying them by types and schedules. This features of the system, along with functions to share <b>wastes</b> information with other agencies outside the site, are expected to enhance the level of <b>wastes</b> recycling to a great extent.

The present study was done to recognize {{the quality and quantity}} of the different generated <b>wastes</b> at various parts of the Faculty of Dentistry-Babol University of Medical Sciences. Methods: The whole solid <b>wastes</b> generated in the odd and even days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) of the middle of the week from the second month of each season were examined. Various dental solid <b>wastes</b> including general, infectious and hazardous chemical <b>wastes</b> were weighted by typical scale. Results: The generation rate of the solid <b>wastes</b> were: total dental wastes: 291. 2 kg including general solid wastes: 251. 3 kg (% 86. 3), infectious <b>wastes</b> and sharps: 38 kg (% 13) and hazardous chemical waste: 2 kg (% 0. 7).
