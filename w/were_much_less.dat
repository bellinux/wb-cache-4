5|$|Although Dean {{was still}} a {{hurricane}} and was expected to re-strengthen slightly before making its second landfall, {{the fact that it}} had weakened caused some residents to let down their guard. As a result, residents of Veracruz and Campeche <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> prepared for the storm than those on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial predictions, Edouard's effects <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than expected. Strong waves struck {{much of the}} East Coast of the United States, killing 2 and {{injuring}} numerous others. In 2011 the National Hurricane Center reported that Edouard had caused a total of US$20million with the greatest damage occurring on Cape Cod, where moderate wind gusts resulted in $4.6million (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Offices {{and classes}} of Harvard University closed {{only for the}} third time in the 20th century, the {{previous}} cases being the New England Hurricane of 1938 and the Blizzard of '78. Although Gloria's winds downed numerous trees and caused tens of thousands in damage in the area, overall effects <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than expected.|$|E
50|$|Since penile and anal cancers <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> {{common than}} {{cervical}} cancer, HPV vaccination {{of young men}} is likely to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> cost-effective than for young women.|$|R
30|$|From the {{descriptions}} above, {{it can be}} known that the packet number of group E <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than that of group C. So, the data transmission overhead of TPNC should <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than that of MPNC.|$|R
50|$|These {{equations}} {{reduce to}} the classical Euler equations if the fluid three-velocity <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> {{than the speed of}} light, the pressure <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than the energy density, and the latter is dominated by the rest mass density.|$|R
5|$|September 5, 2016 - Hurricane Hermine meanders off {{the coast}} of southeastern New York as a {{powerful}} extratropical cyclone. The state prepares for the storm's arrival during the long holiday weekend, but Hermine moved further east than forecasted and the impacts <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than expected. Strong waves and minor coastal flooding occur along the coastline.|$|E
5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed off, insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 35% of {{echinoderm}} genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although taxa that {{thrived in}} low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the late}} Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.|$|E

5|$|Until 1914 the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart {{were the}} only medals that could be {{received}} so prior to 1916 the criteria for the Medal of Honor <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> restrictive than it is today. In 1916 however a board was established to ensure that future awards would be made only for the highest purposes, and some awards were rescinded.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When not playing, he tended to his bar. Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he was quick to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E

25|$|The {{suggestion}} that Lystrosaurus was helped {{to survive and}} dominate by being semi-aquatic has a similar weakness: although temnospondyls become more abundant in the Karoo's Triassic sediments, they <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> numerous than L. murrayi and L. declivis.|$|E

25|$|The United Provinces <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> {{interested}} in a war with Russia, as Russia had significant debts to Dutch bankers, which the war could jeopardize. William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, British ambassador to the United Provinces, was on good terms with local Russian diplomatic staff, and tended to argue against any action that would involve hostilities with Russia.|$|E
25|$|Individuals who {{believed}} AQHA was too restrictive in its registration and membership policies formed the National Quarter Horse Breeders Association (NQHBA) in December 1945. Registration criteria in the NQHBA <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> stringent than AQHA, but yet were not exclusively focused on racing like AQRA. For example, Thoroughbred crosses were freely registrable in NQHBA, {{and they even}} registered Thoroughbreds.|$|E
25|$|A 1987 {{survey found}} that 80 per cent of the workforces {{surveyed}} were described by respondents as consisting {{of a majority of}} one denomination; 20 per cent were overwhelmingly unidenominational, with 95–100 per cent Catholic or Protestant employees.

25|$|The {{resistance}} of plain-bodied Merino sheep to flystrike arose from field investigations by Australian scientists, Drs H.R. Seddon and H.B. Belschner, {{in the early}} 1930s. Non-mulesed Merino ewe bodies were graded as plain (A class), wrinkly (B class) and very wrinkly (C class). The plain-bodied (A class) Merino ewes <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> susceptible to flystrike than wrinkly-bodied Merinos (B and C class).|$|E
