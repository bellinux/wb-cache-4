25|$|In Paul's writings, he {{provides}} the first written account of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be a Christian {{and thus a}} description of Christian spirituality. His letters have been characterized as being the most influential books of the New Testament after the Gospels of Matthew and John.|$|E
25|$|In {{an act of}} reconciliation, Charlie gives Ching-ling {{the wedding}} dress {{that he had made}} for her. His final speech—a blessing upon Sun (who has arrived at the Soong residence) and Ching-ling—is a {{meditation}} on the true meaning of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be a revolutionary. The two men share this spiritual reunion, revolutionaries to the end.|$|E
25|$|This was no fashionable affectation; {{this was}} {{something}} that belonged at the heart of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens. In light of this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not surprising that there are many indications that their sexual relationship was indeed lifelong.|$|R
50|$|I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59 is a 2011 book by Douglas Edwards, who was Google's first {{director}} of marketing and brand management.

50|$|Growing up in 1930s America, {{the young}} Sidney knew <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> struggle.

25|$|The soul is {{sometimes}} plainly {{perceived to be}} but one in its own sensorium, while the body is understood to be all that so variously modifies impressions as to make them in the one instance smell, in another taste, another sight, and thus on, ad finem. Thus the hasheesh-eater knows <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be burned by salt fire, to smell colors, to see sounds, and, much more frequently, to see feelings.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher. The father, a big, gentle Boer {{kneeling}} beside her; while, next tent, his wife was watching a child of six, also dying, and one of about five drooping. Already this couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not let these go, though I begged hard to take them out of the hot tent. I can't describe <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> see these children lying about in a state of collapse. It’s just exactly like faded flowers thrown away. And one has to stand and look on at such misery, {{and be able to do}} almost nothing.|$|E
25|$|One general {{characteristic}} of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail {{is the way}} in which they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, rather than a class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a definitive account of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> follow a rule. Indeed, he argues that any course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by looking to see if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular form of life in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in the 1830s, the {{landscape}} painters of the Hudson River School [...] "sought to define America and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an American.

25|$|Being {{the most}} curious of the Three, Jayfeather {{tries to find}} out who his true parents are. When asking around about his birth, Mousefur reveals that Leafpool accidentally put a strange herb in Mousefur's tansy soon after Jayfeather's birth. After looking through herbs in the {{medicine}} cat's den and with herbs sticking to his pelt, he goes to Mousefur to deliver some fresh-kill. Mousefur says that a certain herb sticking to his fur is the mystery herb, but Jayfeather does not know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>To</b> find out, he asks Littlecloud when the medicine cats meet at the Moonpool. The ShadowClan medicine cat recognizes it as parsley, a herb that stops the milk of a cat whose kits die. Jayfeather remembers that while going back to the camp after birth, there is another cat with him besides Squirrelflight: Leafpool, Jayfeather's true mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet {{they all seem to}} agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be human.|$|E
25|$|Polovtsian maidens sing {{comparing}} love to {{a flower}} that droops {{in the heat}} of the day and is revived by night. They dance together (Dance of the Polovtsian Maidens). Konchakovna joins in the singing hoping that her own lover will join her soon (Konchakovna's Cavatina). The Russian prisoners arrive from their day's work and express their gratitude when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day is fading (Vladimir's Cavatina). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (Love Duet). While her father will consent to the marriage, they know that his will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (Prince Igor's Aria). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes for the chance to regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (Konchak's Aria) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (Polovtsian Dances).|$|E

500|$|As {{described}} by John Peel, [...] "The one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock <b>was</b> that <b>it</b> didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change". Buckley called the era [...] "bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied"; then Bowie [...] "subverted {{the whole notion}} of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a rock star".|$|R
500|$|In {{the debate}} over {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "redskin", team {{supporters}} frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: [...] "It is not up to non-Indians to define an idealized image of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> a Native American." [...] The [...] "positive" [...] stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is [...] "...forcing your idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." ...|$|E
500|$|USA Today wrote [...] "McDermott's prose is {{stunning}} yet emotionally cool," [...] adding: [...] "While it fails as a cohesive novel, After This shines in its small moments, {{much like a}} story collection." [...] Entertainment Weekly {{described it as a}} [...] "lovely needlepoint of a novel." [...] The Economist reviewed the book positively, writing [...] "After This is more than a book about an influential time in history and its effect on those living through it. In its portrayal of the emotions that hold people and families together—the loyalties and frustrations, the sorrows and joys—this quietly unusual novel is ultimately about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be human." ...|$|E
500|$|Ne-Yo's third album, Year of the Gentleman, was {{released}} internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: [...] "To me Year of the Gentleman {{is all about}} a persona, a swag and a charm. I made {{an assessment of the}} music business. And, in my personal opinion, the essence of the gentleman is absent right now. Everybody kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be a gentleman in this business still." ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter accepts {{that the}} circus - or, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more precise, the large circuses - {{of the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries {{reflected}} a number of the ideas associated with modernity. Beyond functioning as a conduit for ideas about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> modern, the demonstration of modernity by these entertainment organizations was one the reasons for their popularity. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> proposed here that this modernity was completely international, encompassing Australia, where new technology and the latest trends in entertainment practices were enthusiastically embraced by leading entrepreneurs...|$|R
500|$|A {{representative}} of WE named Nancy Foushee denied reports that paramedics were delayed from giving care to Kruh and Slee. Foushee stated that attendants of the est training {{are permitted to}} take breaks every four-hours, during the 16-hour session. Foushee described the est training course, which consisted of four sessions each of 16 hours in duration, as a [...] "philosophical inquiry into <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be human". She asserted that the est training was [...] "no more stressful than taking a philosophy course at a university". In a statement published in the Boston Phoenix, Foushee said: [...] "We do not run a company that's dangerous to people. The est training does not cause people to faint. There {{has never been a}} death attributed to est. Never. Ever. Are you clear?" ...|$|E
500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{returned}} to the studio in March 2004 to begin working on their second album A Beautiful Lie, with Josh Abraham producing. During the recording process, the band traveled to four different continents to accommodate Jared Leto's acting career. A Beautiful Lie was notably different from the band's debut album, from both musical and lyrical aspect. [...] "On the first record I created a world, then hid behind it," [...] Leto said. [...] "With A Beautiful Lie, {{it was time to}} take a more personal and less cerebral approach. Although this record is still full of conceptual elements and thematic ideas it is ultimately much more wrapped around the heart than the head. It's about brutal honesty, growth, change. It's an incredibly intimate look into a life that is in the crossroads. A raw emotional journey. A story of life, love, death, pain, joy, and passion. Of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be human." ...|$|E
500|$|Peckinpah {{stated that}} one of his goals for this movie was to give the {{audience}} [...] "some idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be gunned down". A memorable incident occurred, to that end, as Peckinpah's crew were consulting him on the [...] "gunfire" [...] effects {{to be used in the}} film. Not satisfied with the results from the squibs his crew had brought for him, Peckinpah became exasperated; he finally hollered: [...] "That's not what I want! That's not what I want!" [...] He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: [...] "THAT'S the effect I want!!" [...] He also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted on each different type of firearm having its own specific sound effect when fired.|$|E

Of his loss, Blake said, [...] "In my life I never knew <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone. At first when Avis got sick, I thought she just had a cold, but when time passed and she didn’t get better, I made her go to a doctor and we found out she had TB … I suppose I knew from when we found out she had the TB, I understood that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a matter of time." ...|$|R

500|$|When the {{instrumentation}} was completed, Draiman {{began to}} write melody lines for each song. Draiman commented, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be about and so if you start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?" [...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E
500|$|It is {{impossible}} to be certain about what caused Daniel Lambert's extreme weight, but it is considered unlikely to {{have been caused by}} an endocrine (glandular) or genetic disorder. Other than his weight gain, he showed no symptoms of a thyroid disorder, and none of his many portraits show the moon face of a patient with Cushing's syndrome. Patients with Bardet–Biedl syndrome and Prader–Willi syndrome, genetic syndromes which can lead to obesity in patients, also suffer from learning disabilities and muscular weakness, but all those who knew Lambert agreed that he was highly intelligent, was extremely strong physically, and, except for erysipelas and venous insufficiency (varicose veins) in his legs, did not suffer from any health problems. One contemporary commentator remarked that [...] "Mr. Lambert scarcely knows <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be ailing or indisposed". Lambert's only recorded psychological problem was an occasional [...] "depression of the spirits", during his time in London. Although he had an aunt and uncle who were overweight, his parents and surviving siblings remained of normal build throughout their lives.|$|E
500|$|With Lee's higher rank {{in society}} and wealth, he decided he needed to build a mansion to secure his {{position}} {{as one of the}} Virginia gentry. he chose the [...] "Clifts," [...] which he had owned since the mid-1710s. Lee decided on this site because it was located in Westmoreland County, where he was born, and because it was located on the Potomac River. The land was sufficient for having many construction laborers live there. Hannah had an influential say in the design and planning of the interior of the house. Philip, the couple's eldest son, had said, [...] "See <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be ruled by a woman. I should have been now living in a house like this ... had not my father been persuaded by his wife to put up this very inferior dwelling, now over my head." [...] The exact construction date of the house is unknown but it is estimated that construction began around 1725-30, as all of Lee's sons were born at Stratford. Workers on the plantation were from all the working class: free people and indentured servants mostly from the British Isles, and African slaves.|$|E
