They may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem.

It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where I go back to when I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
25|$|Anna plays only a {{very minor}} role {{in the story of}} the first game, {{appearing}} as a sub-boss character for Nina. Her story was further expanded in later games. In Tekken 2, as in the first tournament, the 20-year-old Nina was once again hired to assassinate the sponsor of the current tournament, Kazuya Mishima. Whether at Kazuya's discretion or Anna's own volition, Anna became a bodyguard for Kazuya, along with Ganryu and Bruce Irvin, who were all charged with Kazuya's protection. Nina was later captured by Mishima Zaibatsu forces and used in Dr. Bosconovitch's cryonics research. Learning about this, Anna volunteered to be another test subject, requesting that she be woken in the future {{at the same time as}} Nina. Her reason for doing this is unknown, but the two most reasonable explanations would be because she didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> lonely without Nina, and she didn't wanted her sister's age preserved in a cryonic sleep while she herself continues to age.|$|E

40|$|Values reflect {{how people}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{experience}} the world; emotions reflect how people actually experience the world. Therefore, we propose that across cultures people desire emotions {{that are consistent}} with their values. Whereas prior research focused on the desirability of specific affective states or 1 or 2 target emotions, we offer a broader account of desired emotions. After reporting initial evidence for the potential causal effects of values on desired emotions in a preliminary study (N = 200), we tested the predictions of our proposed model in 8 samples (N = 2, 328) from distinct world cultural regions. Across cultural samples, we found that people who endorsed values of self-transcendence (e. g., benevolence) <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more empathy and compassion, people who endorsed values of self-enhancement (e. g., power) <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more anger and pride, people who endorsed values of openness to change (e. g., self-direction) <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more interest and excitement, and people who endorsed values of conservation (e. g., tradition) <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more calmness and less fear. These patterns were independent of differences in emotional experience. We discuss the implications of our value-based account of desired emotions for understanding emotion regulation, culture, and other individual differences...|$|R
25|$|The season {{opens with}} the Conner women confronting {{the issue of}} {{pregnancy}}: Roseanne takes a pregnancy test that turns up negative. Roseanne takes on a job as waitress in the restaurant at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets Leon (Martin Mull) and Bonnie (Bonnie Sheridan). Jackie gets injured on the job, which results in her breaking up with her boyfriend Gary. Becky begins dating Mark Healy (Glenn Quinn); when her parents forbid her to see him, she temporarily moves in with Jackie. Dan is floored to learn his father Ed and Crystal plan to marry; Crystal is pregnant with Ed's baby. Roseanne locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy (Meagen Fay). Nana Mary (Shelley Winters) makes her first appearance at a family barbecue. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While {{they are in the}} process of getting the business off the ground, Ziggy decides to leave because he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> responsible if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money for Dan to open it by himself. We never hear about him again.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E
500|$|Orci and Kurtzman read {{graduate}} school dissertations on the series for inspiration; they noted comparisons of Kirk, Spock and McCoy to Shakespearian archetypes, and Kirk and Spock's friendship echoing that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They also noted that, {{in the creation}} of this film, they were influenced by Star Wars, particularly in pacing. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the space, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> speed and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> all the things that can become a little bit lost when Star Trek becomes very stately" [...] said Orci. Star Wars permeated in the way they wrote the action sequences, while Burk noted Kirk and Spock's initially cold relationship mirrors how [...] "Han Solo wasn't friends with anyone when they started on their journey." [...] Spock and Uhura were put in an actual relationship as a nod to early episodes highlighting her interest in him. Orci wanted to introduce strong Starfleet captains, concurring with an interviewer that most captains in other films were [...] "patsies" [...] included to make Kirk look greater by comparison.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the process of {{resonance}} in specializing (Côté & Hay, 2002) athletes and to examine the perceived effects of a resonance-based intervention on both training and performance quality and subjective well-being. Four female middle distance track athletes (M = 16. 5 years) participated in in-depth, semi-structured interviews / consultations and reflective journaling over a period of 10 weeks using the Resonance Performance Model (RPM; Newburg, Kimiecik, Durand-Bush & Doell, 2002) as a structural framework. Results showed that the athletes followed a process of performance similar to expert performers but were challenged in articulating how they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> in their training and performances. However, over the intervention period, they became more conscious of how they felt during training and daily living. An awareness of how they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> was perceived <b>to</b> positively influence overall well-being and quality of track performance. Decision making behavior was also identified as being influenced by a heightened awareness of how each athlete <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel...</b>|$|R

Andy Siegel, a comedy development executive for ABC at the time, felt the series failed because audiences {{did not want to}} watch a show displaying inadequate medical care, even though it was done in a humorous fashion. In reminiscing about the series he stated: [...] "When people see doctors on television they really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that they're in good hands. That no matter what happens it is a reassuring experience." [...] William Asher, in a 2000 interview, summed up the demise of the series by saying: [...] "It didn't get on. It's too late.

500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character.

It's just that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E

[...] Also heard is a rendition by children of [...] "Ring a Ring o' Roses", rhythmic panting, and an original female vocal line concerning infant mortality. Sounds magazine stated that the deliberate placement of Fox's sexually provocative [...] "Touch Me" [...] alongside [...] "Ring a Ring O'Roses" [...] ("the nursery rhyme about the Plague") [...] "highlights explicitly the depth of contradiction embedded in society's attitude towards death through sex".

500|$|Form and Fuller {{recognized}} the iconic {{status of the}} music used {{in the first four}} Friday the 13th films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film.

[...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like they pigeonholed me, but I felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show."
