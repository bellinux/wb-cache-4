25|$|In December 1987, {{during his}} tenure as mayor, Sanders {{recorded}} a folk album titled <b>We</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Overcome</b> with 30 Vermont musicians. As Sanders was not skilled at singing, he performed his vocals in a talking blues style. Sanders appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy-drama film Sweet Hearts Dance, playing a man who distributes candy to young trick-or-treaters. In 1999, he acted in the film My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception, {{playing the role of}} Rabbi Manny Shevitz. In this role he mourned the Brooklyn Dodgers moving to Los Angeles, reflecting Sanders's own upbringing in Brooklyn. On February 6, 2016, Sanders was a guest star alongside Larry David on Saturday Night Live, playing a Polish immigrant on a steamship that was sinking near the Statue of Liberty.|$|E

5000|$|Now I {{realized}} what makes our generation unique, what defines us apart {{from those who}} came before the hopeful winter of 1961, and those who came after the murderous spring of 1968. We are the first generation that learned from experience, in our innocent twenties, that things were not really getting better, that <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> not <b>overcome.</b> <b>We</b> felt, {{by the time we}} reached thirty, that we had already glimpsed the most compassionate leaders our nation could produce, and they had all been assassinated. And from this time forward, things would get worse: our best political leaders were part of memory now, not hope.The stone was at the bottom of the hill and we were all alone.|$|R

Are we to believe and trust {{that we are going to}} heaven? St. John does not say so; he was far too wise, my friends, to say so: for a man's trusting that he is going to heaven, if that is all the faith he has, is more likely to make the world overcome him, than him overcome the world. For it will make him but too ready to say, 'If I am sure to be saved after I die, it matters not so very much what I do before I die. I may follow the way of the world here, in money-making and meanness, and selfishness; and then die in peace, and go to heaven after all.' ...|$|E

The more recent analysis of complete mtDNA sequences from 672 Japanese individuals has provided a significant refinement of the East Asian mtDNA phylogeny (Tanaka et al. 2004). Combining these and other published data, Figure 1 summarizes the Asian mtDNA tree topology. With many manuscripts that refine the phylogeny being published almost simultaneously it is not surprising then that some confusion regarding to the naming of the haplogroups and their branching order arises. In the following section <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> try to <b>overcome</b> some of these difficulties. Comments for the Asian mtDNA phylogeny outlined on Figure 1 First of all, we acknowledge that the monophyletic decent of R 11 and B; D 5 and D 6; D 4 k cannot be taken for granted because their defining positions are known to be highly variable.

6000|$|When Beelzebub {{had ended}} his oration, then Apollyon did begin. 'My opinion,' said he, 'concerning this matter, is, {{that we go}} on fair and softly, not doing things in a hurry. Let our friends in Mansoul go on still to pollute and defile it, by seeking to draw it yet more into sin (for {{there is nothing like}} sin to devour Mansoul). If this be done, and it takes effect, Mansoul, of itself, will leave off to watch, to petition, or {{anything}} else that should tend to her security and safety; for she will forget her Emmanuel, she will not desire his company, and can she be gotten thus to live, her Prince will not come to her in haste. Our trusty friend, Mr. Carnal-Security, with one of his tricks did drive him out of the town; and why may not my Lord Covetousness, and my Lord Lasciviousness, by what they may do, keep him out of the town? And this I will tell you, (not because you know it not,) that two or three Diabolonians, if entertained and countenanced by the town of Mansoul, will do more to the keeping of Emmanuel from them, and towards making the town of Mansoul your own, than can an army of a legion that should be sent out from us to withstand him. Let, therefore, this first project that our friends in Mansoul have set on foot, be strongly and diligently carried on, with all cunning and craft imaginable; and let them send continually, under one guise or another, more and other of their men to play with the people of Mansoul; and then, perhaps, we shall not need to be at the charge of making a war upon them; or if that must of necessity be done, yet the more sinful they are, the more unable, to be sure, they will be to resist us, and then the more easily <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>overcome</b> them. And besides, suppose (and that is the worst that can be supposed) that Emmanuel should come to them again, why may not the same means, or the like, drive him from them once more? Yea, why may he not, by their lapse into that sin again, be driven from them for ever, for the sake of which he was at the first driven from them for a season? And if this should happen, then away go with him his rams, his slings, his captains, his soldiers, and he leaveth Mansoul naked and bare. Yea, will not this town, when she sees herself utterly forsaken of her Prince, of her own accord open her gates again unto you, and make of you as in the days of old? But this must be done by time, a few days will not effect so great a work as this.' ...|$|E
