5|$|During his exile at Cephellania, Hybrida {{pretended to}} act as {{governor}} of the island <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> secretly allowed. In 49 BC, his nephew, Mark Antony, {{was elected to the}} role of tribune of the people and a legate of Caesar's in Italy. Despite this, Hybrida remained in exile until 47 BC when he returned to Rome at the request of Caesar himself. One possible explanation for this is that Mark Antony was indebted to Hybrida; as Hybrida was in exile and had no civil rights, he could not enforce a payment and this suited Mark Antony. Hybrida was a candidate for censorship around 45 BC; his character and support from Mark Antony, however, made his attempt at the position a failure. The final mention of Hybrida during his life comes from Cicero who commented upon Mark Antony's divorce from Antonia Hybrida Major and the insult this conferred upon Hybrida himself.|$|E

5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it.

Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of this country had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated {{in the course of the}} summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E
