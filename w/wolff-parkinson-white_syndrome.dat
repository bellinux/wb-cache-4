5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as <b>Wolff-Parkinson-White</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

40|$|Identical 10 -year-old twins, {{both with}} electrocardiograms showing a short PR {{interval}} and a normal QRS complex but with dramatically different electrophysiological characteristics, are described.

After treatment with amiodarone, the patient became asymptomatic and a repeat study showed that the features of the atrioventricular nodal bypass tract were no longer present and though re-entry tachycardias using the accessory atrioventricular pathway could still be induced, their rates were slower than before treatment. The other twin, in spite of an identical surface electrocardiogram, was asmymptomatic.

25|$|<b>Wolff–Parkinson–White</b> <b>syndrome</b> (WPW) is a {{disorder}} {{due to a}} specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart which has resulted in symptoms. About 40% of people with the electrical problem never develop symptoms. Symptoms can include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.|$|E

500|$|Several {{reports have}} been {{published}} in the literature documenting the effects of consumption of P.semilanceata. Typical symptoms include visual distortions of color, depth and form, progressing to visual hallucinations. The effects are similar to the experience following consumption of LSD, although milder. Common side effects of mushroom ingestion include pupil dilation, increased heart rate, unpleasant mood, and overresponsive reflexes. As is typical of the symptoms associated with psilocybin mushroom ingestion, [...] "the effect on mood in particular is dependent on the subject's pre-exposure personality traits", and [...] "identical doses of psilocybin may have widely differing effects in different individuals." [...] Although most cases of intoxication resolve without incident, there have been isolated cases with severe consequences, especially after higher dosages or persistent use. In one case reported in Poland in 1998, an 18-year-old man developed <b>Wolff-Parkinson-White</b> <b>syndrome,</b> arrhythmia, and suffered myocardial infarction after ingesting P.semilanceata frequently over the period of a month. The cardiac damage and myocardial infarction was suggested to be a result of either coronary vasoconstriction, or because of platelet hyperaggregation and occlusion of small coronary arteries.|$|E
