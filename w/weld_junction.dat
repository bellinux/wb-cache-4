The possible causes for low toughness are explored, including microstructure, retained austenite, inclusions and crystallographic texture.

This mechanism suggests that an appropriate heat treatment may alter the texture sufficiently to enhance the toughness of the zone concerned...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{most common}} cause of failure in bus {{structures}} is fatigue, and it is generally located at strain concentration zones that appear in the <b>welded</b> <b>junctions</b> of these structures. Therefore, measurement and characterization of these regions becomes crucial in structural analysis and design of bus structures. In bus structural analysis, simplified finite element models (FEM) are generally used, since they enable to examine different variables with low computational cost. Nevertheless, by utilizing these models, it is impossible to reproduce the structure junction geometry in detail, which impedes the calculation of strain in the concentration areas. In the present paper, measure and characterization of the strain concentration factor (SCF) of <b>welded</b> <b>junctions</b> typically present in bus structure has been carried out. For this purpose, 10 ‘T’ <b>welded</b> <b>junctions</b> were tested, disposed in two different configurations. Every junction was subjected to two types of load, and to 10 different load levels for each load type. A DIC equipment was used to obtain the deformations close to the weld bead. Once processed al the measured data, and calculated the SCF, it was characterized as function of load type and level. The results presented in this article make possible to know the actual strain experienced by the tested junctions in simplified FEM models, allowing a more precise structural design without computational cost increase. Additionally, an alternative methodology for the calculation of SCF based on the DIC techniques has been presented...|$|R

Two important experimental techniques were employed {{during the course of this}} work,  firstly a quasi-static contact method was employed to establish the workpiece/tool interfacial temperature above  which strongly adherent layers may be formed. This technique revealed that the critical temperatures which  marked  adhesion and welding, were 740, 820 and 800 °C for coated and uncoated carbides, and 760 and 900 °C  for PCD and CBN tools respectively. Furthermore, the technique has been used to study the integrity of the bulk  tool material, and/or individual coatings on their substrates, when <b>welded</b> <b>junctions</b> formed between the tool and  workpiece are separated. With regard to the latter it was observed that in all cases fracture was initiated in the bulk of the harder tool material rather than in the workpiece or at the <b>welded</b> <b>junction</b> interface. Secondly, a quick-stop  technique was used to study chip formation and tool wear when cutting with carbides, CBN and PCD tools under  nominally the same conditions. The predominant wear mechanisms for each of the tool materials was found to be based on a diffusion/dissolution  process. The wear process is discussed in detail for each of the tool materials and reasons advanced for observed  differences in performance when removing material from a titanium alloy workpiece. The wear resistance and quality of the machined surface was found to be superior when cutting with the ultra-hard materials  than with the carbide grades and in particular the PCD tool was found to produce exceptionally good surface finish.   In the case of coated carbide tool grades rapid removal of the coated layers occurred leaving the substrate  vulnerable to reaction with the workpiece material and this is considered to explain the seeming absence of  beneficial effects when cutting with these grades...|$|R

Pressure transducers within the barrel of the wind tunnel have also been used to obtain the pressure history during the free piston compression process. The pressure measurements have been used to provide a theoretical value for the flow stagnation temperature for direct comparison with the thermocouple measurements. Assuming isentropic compression of the test gas, the flow stagnation temperature would be about 571 K for the current operating condition. After applying a response-time correction for the thermocouple signals, a stagnation temperature value of about 495 K was obtained from the measurements. The measured stagnation temperature of the test gas is somewhat lower than the isentropic value because of heat loss from the test gas to the barrel during the test gas compression and discharge process...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{continuous}} fiber laser (1064 nm wavelength, 30 W/cm 2) {{is used to}} irradiate multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on different substrate surfaces. Effects of substrates on nano-welding of MWCNTs are investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). For MWCNTs on silica, after 3 s irradiation, nanoscale welding with good quality can be achieved due to breaking C–C bonds and formation of new graphene layers. While <b>welding</b> <b>junctions</b> can be formed until 10 s for the MWCNTs on silicon, the difference of irradiation time to achieve welding is attributed to the difference of thermal conductivity for silica and silicon. As the irradiation time is prolonged up to 12. 5 s, most of the MWCNTs are welded to a silicon substrate, which leads to their frameworks of tube walls on the silicon surface. This is because the accumulation of absorbed energy makes the temperature rise. Then chemical reactions among silicon, carbon and nitrogen occur. New chemical bonds of Si–N and Si–C achieve the welding between the MWCNTs and silicon. Vibration modes of Si 3 N 4 appear at peaks of 363 cm− 1 and 663 cm− 1.

This paper was also presented at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference in San Diego, USA, and was awarded the best paper prize. This contribution deals with the complex temperature profiles that are generated by the welding process in the intersection region of thick walled, cylinder-cylinder junctions. These affect material microstructure, mechanical properties and residual stresses. Knowledge of the thermal history and temperature distributions are thus critical in developing control schemes for acceptable residual stress distributions to improve in-service component behavior.

40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{techniques are}} used in the investigation of cubic boron nitride (CBN) and polycrystalline diamond (PCD) as cutting tool materials for titanium alloy workpieces, in comparison with the currently used coated tungsten carbide specifications. One employs a quasi-static contact method to establish the temperature above which marked adhesion and welding occurs between the tool and the workpiece materials. After separation, the mode of failure of the <b>welded</b> <b>junctions</b> is studied to establish the path of crack propagation. The critical temperatures are shown to be 740, 760 and 900 °C for the carbide, PCD and CBN tools, respectively, and in all cases failure of the junctions occurs in the bulk of the tool material. The other method used is the 'quick-stop' technique, under otherwise normal cutting conditions, to study chip formation and tool wear. The predominant wear mechanisms are identified and discussed for each of the tool materials and reasons advanced for observed differences in performance when removing the material from a titanium alloy workpiece. The wear resistance and quality of the machined surface is observed to be consistently better with the ultra-hard materials than with the carbide, and in particular, the PCD tool produces exceptionally good surface finish.

30|$|To {{investigate}} whether the <b>welding</b> of <b>junctions</b> with a gap is possible without significant {{damage to the}} nanowire, we constructed an experiment. A single nanowire was found connected to an electrode on one side, and with a 400 -nm gap between its other end and the electrode (Fig.  6 c). The nanowire had a silver reservoir attached to the wire region closest to the gap. The first step (voltage sweeps) of the welding procedure was conducted on this nanowire, {{and the result is}} shown in Fig.  6 d. Using defects in the nanowire structure, we can measure the distance between various locations on the nanowire and the bottom electrode in SEM images before and after the procedure. In the after images, it is observed that the points on the nanowire remained the same in relation to the bottom pad. Thus, physical movements such as stretching did not occur. The reservoir, however, expanded enough to close the gap. The local expansion of the reservoir points to local Joule heating as the mechanism by which gap <b>junctions</b> <b>weld.</b> It has been shown that electron discharge in gaps as large as 10  μm is possible with fairly low voltages due to a phenomenon called ion-enhanced field emission [31]. The heat caused by the electrons traversing the gap seems to melt the silver closest to the gap until the weld is complete. If, like in Fig.  6 b, there is not enough silver near the tip of the nanowire to complete the weld, the generated heat causes significant melting and the destabilization of the nanowires. With the nanowire shown in Fig.  6 d, however, the reservoir provided enough material for the gap to be bridged while keeping the nanowire intact. The criteria then for <b>welding</b> gap <b>junctions</b> are that the gaps must be small enough or the nanowires thick enough, so that the melted silver can traverse the gap and initiate contact. The possibility of this kind of weld is in contrast to other types of reported nanowelding, such as nanosintering, where the constituents have to be in contact for welding to take place [32].|$|R

Piping branch junctions and nozzle attachments to main pressure vessels are common engineering components used in the power, oil and gas, and shipbuilding industries amongst others. These components are usually fabricated by multipass welding. The latter process is known to induce residual stresses at the fabrication stage, which can have severe adverse effects on the in-service behavior of such critical components. It is thus desirable if the distributions of residual stresses can be predicted well in advance of welding execution. This paper presents a comprehensive study of three dimensional residual stress distributions in a stainless steel tee branch junction during a multipass welding process. A full three dimensional thermomechanical finite element model has been developed for this purpose. A newly developed meshing technique has been used to model the complex intersection areas of the <b>welded</b> <b>junction</b> with all hexahedral elements.

Other research topic for SMAs regards the retention of the shape memory effect cyclic stability; in fact, good shape memory properties frequently decrease during SME cycling of material. A method able to improve the cyclic stability of TiNi shape memory effect is the grain refinement. Considering these above mentioned research topics, a solid state welding process, as the Friction Stir Welding, is thus attractive for SMA joining and it exhibits potentials for achieving welded joints affected by microstructural changes that preserve the shape memory properties and retain, furthermore, the cyclic stability of SME. The basic objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of friction stir welding process to join TiNi shape memory alloy sheets flat memorized, preserving the TiNi shape memory behaviour. This aim has been pursued determining the influence of the thermomechanical modifications induced by Friction Stir Processing of TiNi sheets on the functional properties of material.

These studies are directed toward obtaining information on the dynamics of fluidized bed operation, the removal of volatile fission products and solids particles from gases, the development of equipment and operating techniques, and the various long term disposal aspects of all radioactive wastes. Laboratory studies on the removal of volatile ruthenium from a simulated calciner off-gas showed the removal efficiency of silica gel to decrease with successive wetting and drying cycles. Electrostatic precipitators {{were found to have}} a higher removal efficiency for solid particles (alumina) when a wetted wall rather than a dry wall type was used. Tests to determine the distribution of ruthenium in a pilot plant calciner were performed. Pilot plant data on particle growth in a fluidized bed were compared with theoretical equations. Operating experience with a NaK heat transfer system, and with liquid flow controllers is reported. The results of a series of qualitative tests to determine the likelihood of an explosive reaction should NaK leak into a fluidized bed calciner indicated that such a reaction is unlikely. A NaK leak that occurred at a <b>welded</b> <b>junction</b> was attributed to thermal overstressing of the metal and not due to corrosion. Calcium fluoride-impregnated Teflon was found to be a superior gasketing material, both chemically and mechanically, to pure Teflon. A literature survey on the chemistry of zirconium in a calcination process suggested the possibility of calcination in contact with silica and a laboratory unit is being installed to study the process. The hydraulics of a pulsed plate solids-liquid contactor and its associated equipment were determined. A preliminary investigation was started of the possibility of using metallizing techniques to surface coat solid particles and thereby reduce the leaching of fission products when contacted with ground water. Construction of a demonstrational fluidized bed calciner was approximately half completed; however, the national steel strike has slowed the construction schedule and the completion date cannot be estimated until the strike is settled.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is, {{with the aid of}} a Mini-Cell-System (MCS), to {{characterize}} the corrosive behaviour of junctions between steel crown and steel wire prepared by different ways, soldered and welded. For this purpose different types of placeholders have been produced, using a Nd-YAG welding laser or three different silver containing solders. To consider the possible influence of present  day eating habits of children on the corrosive process, a 1 %tive NaCl-Solution, diet Coke and Ice tea were used as electrolyte. In a second test series some samples were stored in a cupboard for 487 days at 37 °C, standing in a 1 %tive NaCl-Solution or diet Coke periodically photographed for documentation. In addition to the natural corrosive process it should be seized the influence on corrosive stability, by destroying the oxidation layer through chewing and grinding ones teeth, adjusted in the laboratory through daily brushing of the samples. Electrochemical analysis, represented by Current (I) -Voltage (E) -Curves, has shown, that the corrosive susceptibility depends on the kind of electrolyte being used. As was to be expected, the 1 %tive NaCl-Solution was the most aggressive electrolyte, followed by diet Coke. It is clear to see that in all electrolytic solutions the corrosive activity of solder connections is significant higher in comparison to crown, wire and laser <b>welded</b> <b>junction.</b> This applies to the delivering condition as it does to the material condition after manufacturing. If we compare the single alloys with their brand new products, we can see that the corrosion rate of all crowns and wires is reduced after manufacturing, soldering or welding, the samples. One reason for the improvement of electrochemical stability is probably the heat treatment during soldering or welding. In the second test series the samples were stored in 1 %tive NaCl-Solution, and the samples which oxidation layer has been removed daily showed as expected the highest corrosion. After all the resulting highly detailed pictures of the samples` surface structure are only possible because of the very small measuring area (only 0. 008 cm 2) of the Mini-Cell-System. To sum up, it can be said that the use of silver solder is no longer state of the art. Instead, it is recommended that the Nd-YAG laser technique should be used for connecting similar alloys to manufacture orthodontic appliances. It is also recommended that only biocompatible materials, which meet all the requirements during the manufacturing process should be used. Although these metals do not release toxic quantities during the corrosive process in the patients mouth, the long-term consequences for a childs body, for example allergic reactions, are impossible to predict...|$|R

The sliding of aluminum pin on diamond polished surface showed interesting results. Hence, another series of experiments using only diamond polished surface are conducted. The surface roughness of the steel surface achieved is 0. 05 micro-meters. The load is 47 N and speed is 0. 043 ms- 1. The morphology of transfer layer and pin surface is studied using a Scanning Electron Microscope. Results of compression and tensile test: The flow stress is found to decrease with increase in compression test temperature. The SEM micrograph indicates large amount of fragmentation of harder phase with increase in strain rate at all temperature except for 423 K. The fractured surface under tensile loading shows both intergranular and transgranular failure. Results of adhesion test: The area covered by the material transfer is found to increase with increase in temperature. The test can be used, to study the adhesive tendency between two pair of contacting surfaces. The area covered by the material transfer {{is found to be}} maximum at 723 K. Results of sliding of die-steel pin on aluminum disc in vacuum: 1. The ANOVA (analysis of variance) results indicate the existence of transition speed of about 0. 5 ms- 1, more than which the friction coefficient was found constant. The extrusion speeds employed in industries are in the range of 0. 1 ms- 1 to 1. 7 ms- 1 and the transition speed found in the present study is within this range. 2. The magnitude of friction, with a few exceptions, is found to be independent of temperature and sliding speed when the sliding speed is 0. 5 ms- 1 and above. The invariance of friction coefficient with temperature and sliding speed beyond 0. 5 ms- 1 is beneficial in that it will not lead to any instability like stick-slip or squeal. 3. Though both ambient temperature and speed influence the morphology of transfer layer and friction coefficient, speed is found to be dominant according to statistical analysis. 4. The observed dependency of friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer on test temperature and normal load is attributed to decrease in flow stress and increase in friction factor ‘m’, a ratio of interfacial shear stress to shear yield stress of the softer material. Though ANOVA shows the significance of speed and not that of temperature, the observed dependence of friction coefficient on temperature is attributed to the enhanced effect of adhesion at elevated temperature observed in the adhesion test. 5. The state of stress at the contacting surface is found to control the morphology of transfer layer. When the normal load exceeded 40 N, it gave rise to higher magnitude of stress state at the contacting surface, resulting in formation of continuous transfer layer and hence the higher magnitude of friction coefficient. 6. Plastic deformation model based on Rigney’s approach for estimating friction coefficient can be used. The estimated friction coefficient is on the higher side. Hence, any design of equipments based on the Rigney’s plastic deformation model is a conservative design. 7. There appears to be a close relation between the morphology of wear track and quantity of wear-loss. The formation of debris and rough track, primarily for low temperature sliding indicate larger magnitude of wear-loss. The parameters, which bring about increased ductility of aluminum as observed in the case of higher temperature of sliding, results in reduced wear-loss due to large scale smearing and back transfer of material. The results of sliding of aluminum pin on die-steel ring in vacuum: 1. The mode of sliding changes from adhesive to abrasive mode depending on depth of penetration, tan(θ) where θ is the base angle of the conical asperity and average roughness parameter Sa,all of them in turn depend on morphology of die steel surface and test temperature. 2. The friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer are found to depend on the mode of sliding. The sub-surface plastic deformation, which characterizes the friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer, is dependent on temperature of sliding. 3. The sliding experiment is capable of simulating the stress state on the bearing channel of the die; elucidating evolution of transfer layer, with change in operating parameters. 4. The ANOVA has clearly indicated the significance in friction coefficient at different temperatures and surface textures. In addition, the complex comparison below and above homogenization temperature (573 K) has indicated significance in friction coefficient and thereby recognizing the importance of extrusion of aluminum at a temperature where it is in a single phase. Also, ANOVA indicates the dependency of both friction coefficient and transfer layer on the texture, i. e. either a lay or random. The results of sliding aluminum pin on diamond polished die steel ring: 1. Shearing of the cold <b>welded</b> <b>junction</b> is a probable mechanism involved in the formation of transfer layer up to 423 K. 2. The transgranular and intergranular mode of fracture are identified to be the two possible modes of fracture of the asperity at temperatures greater than 573 K. The large ductility of the aluminum alloy facilitated smearing resulting in a continuous transfer layer at temperatures greater than 573 K. 3. The formation of a continuous transfer layer at temperatures greater than 573 K is responsible for the observed high friction coefficient at these temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy observations of the fracture surfaces of the tensile test specimen revealed fracture to be a combination of both transgranular and intergranular modes...|$|R
