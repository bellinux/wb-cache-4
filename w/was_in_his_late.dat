5|$|Sarah (Hana Hayes) is Joel's twelve-year-old daughter, whom he {{had when}} he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> teens, and the game's first playable character. The posters and photos on her wall suggest {{that she was a}} keen soccer player. At the start of the game, she gives her father a new watch for his birthday. In {{the early hours of the}} next day, she is awoken by a commotion and the sound of Tommy phoning Joel. Later, Joel bursts into his office, pulls a {{revolver}} out of his desk drawer and shoots their neighbor. Sarah leaves with Tommy and Joel, but her leg is hurt in a crash, forcing Joel to carry her. On the outskirts of their hometown, they come across a soldier, who follows his orders and shoots at them. Sarah is fatally wounded by bullets and dies in Joel's arms.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce {{showed little}} {{interest}} in women, but when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> thirties his friend Thomas Babington recommended twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed {{little interest in}} his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807).

25|$|Emerson {{is often}} {{known as one}} of the most liberal {{democratic}} thinkers of his time who believed that through the democratic process, slavery should be abolished. While being an avid abolitionist who was known for his criticism of the legality of slavery, Emerson struggled with the implications of race. His usual liberal leanings did not clearly translate when it came to believing that all races had equal capability or function, which was a common conception for the period in which he lived. Many critics believe that it was his views on race that inhibited him from becoming an abolitionist earlier in his life and also inhibited him from being more active in the antislavery movement. Much of his early life, he was silent on the topic of race and slavery. Not until he was well into his 30s did Emerson begin to publish writings on race and slavery, and not until he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> 40s and 50s did he became known as an antislavery activist.|$|E
25|$|Marsh {{was educated}} at Amersham Hall school, Reading, and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where, unusually, he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> 20s {{by the time}} of his {{matriculation}} in 1900. As a cricketer, he was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper, and he had already played a single Minor Counties game for Oxfordshire County Cricket Club before he arrived in Cambridge. He was not able to secure a regular place in the Cambridge University first team in any of his three years at Cambridge, and did not play in the University Match against Oxford University. His younger brother Frederick, who was contemporary with him at Jesus College but then remained for a fourth year in 1904, was even less favoured by the cricket selectors in the years that James was at the university, appearing only in trial matches from 1901 to 1903, but finally achieved selection in 1904 and then proceeded to break the record for an individual score in the University Match. James Marsh played regularly for Oxfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship from 1901 through to 1906, but after leaving university appeared in only one further first-class game, an end-of-season game against the 1907 South Africans.|$|E

500|$|Berry was {{religious}} {{as well as}} worldly, {{and collected}} relics as keenly as other types of objects. [...] By 1397 both of his sons had died, he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> fifties, and {{he had begun to}} think of his tomb, finally deciding to build a new [...] "Sainte Chapelle" [...] in his capital of Bourges to house it. [...] His collection of relics included objects claimed to be the wedding ring of the Virgin Mary, a cup used at the Wedding at Cana, a piece of the Burning Bush and many others. [...] However the provenance of the Holy Thorn, as well as its centrality to the Passion of Christ must have given it a special status. [...] The crown from which the thorn came had been bought in 1239 by Louis IX, both a saint and King of France, from the Latin Emperor in Constantinople, Baldwin II, along with a portion of the True Cross. [...] Both had been in Constantinople since the Muslim Conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century, and may very well be the same relics that Bishop Paulinus of Nola saw in Jerusalem in 409. [...] There {{are a number of other}} thorn relics said to have come from the relic in the Paris Sainte Chapelle, including the far smaller Salting Reliquary in the British Museum, a French pendant of about 1340.|$|E
