25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>so</b> far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{returns to}} the monsters, and regrets <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> little about pre-Christian English mythology; he resorts instead to Icelandic myth, which he argues {{must have had a}} similar {{attitude}} to monsters, men and gods. The Northern gods, like men, are doomed to die. The Southern (Roman and Greek) pagan gods were immortal, so to Tolkien (a Christian), the Southern religion [...] "must go forward to philosophy or relapse into anarchy": death and the monsters are peripheral. But the Northern myths, and Beowulf, put the monsters, mortality and death in the centre. Tolkien is therefore very interested in the contact of Northern and Christian thought in the poem, where the scriptural Cain is linked to eotenas (giants) and ylfe (elves), not through confusion but [...] "an indication of the precise point at which an imagination, pondering old and new, was kindled". The poem is, Tolkien states, [...] "an historical poem about the pagan past, or an attempt at one", obviously not with modern ideas of [...] "literal historical fidelity". The poet takes an old plot (a marauding monster troubling the Scylding court) paints a vivid picture of the old days, for instance using the Old Testament image of the shepherd patriarchs of Israel in the folces hyrde (people's shepherd) of the Danes.|$|E

2500|$|If {{water is}} poured on level ground it will avoid the parts which are dry and move towards {{those that are}} wet. If (two) {{identical}} pieces of firewood are exposed to fire, the latter will avoid the damp and ignite the dry one. All things reject what is different (to themselves) and follow what is akin. Thus it is that if (two) [...] are similar, they will coalesce; if notes correspond, they resonate [...] The experimental proof [...] of this is extraordinarily clear. Try tuning musical instruments. The kung [...] note or the shang [...] note struck upon one lute will be answered by [...] the kung or the shang notes from other stringed instruments. They sound by themselves. This is nothing miraculous , but the Five Notes being in relation; they are what they are according to the numbers [...] (whereby the world is constructed). (Similarly) lovely things summon others among the class of lovely things; repulsive things summon others among the class of repulsive things. This arises from the complementary {{way in which a}} thing of the same class responds [...] as for instance if a horse whinnies another horse whinnies in answer , and if a cow lows, another cow lows in response [...] When a great ruler is about to arise auspicious omens first appear; when a ruler is about to be destroyed, there are baleful ones beforehand. Things indeed summon each other, like to like, a dragon bringing rain, a fan driving away heat, the place where an army has been being thick with thorns. Things, whether lovely or repulsive, all have an origin. (If) they are taken to constitute destiny (it is because) no man knows where that origin is[...] [...] It is not only the two [...] of the Yin and the Yang which advance and retreat [...] according to their categories. Even the origins of the varied fortunes, good and bad, of men, behave in the same way. There is no happening that does not depend for its beginning upon something prior, to which it responds because (it belongs to the same) category, and so moves ... (As I said) when the note kung is struck forth from a lute, other kung strings (nearby) reverberate of themselves in complementary (resonance) a case of comparable things being affected according to the classes to which they belong [...] They are moved by a sound which has no visible form, and when men can see no form accompanying motion and action, they describe the phenomenon as a 'spontaneous sounding' [...] And wherever there is a mutual reaction [...] without anything visible (to account for it) they describe the phenomenon as 'spontaneously so' [...] But in truth there is no (such thing as) 'spontaneously so' (in this sense). (I.e. everything in the universe is attuned to certain other things, and changes as they change.) That there are (circumstances which) cause a man to become what in fact he is, <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> <b>So</b> also things do have a real causative (power), invisible though this may be. (1, tr.
