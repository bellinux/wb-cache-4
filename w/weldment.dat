The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing <b>weldment</b> positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E

40|$|Instrumented {{impact testing}} {{was used to}} {{investigate}} the effects of aging on the impact deformation and fracture of different <b>weldments</b> of an AISI type 316 L stainless steel plate and a superduplex stainless steel plate. Aging at 800 degreesC of metal inert gas (MIG) and laser beam (LB) <b>weldments</b> of the 316 L stainless steel plate produced a precipitation of sigma phase, which was more intense in the MIG <b>weldments.</b> Correspondingly, the MIG <b>weldments</b> showed a noticeable decrease in impact energy and in impact yield and maximum loads as the aging time was increased. The LB <b>weldments,</b> on the other hand, showed an initial decrease in absorbed energy followed by a noticeable increase, because of the appearance of delaminations during the fracture event. Aging at 900 degreesC of the parent metal and of LB and plasma arc (PA) <b>weldments</b> of the superduplex stainless steel plate produced a precipitation of sigma phase which was much more intense in the parent metal. Both the parent metal and the <b>weldments</b> showed a noticeable decrease in impact energy and in impact yield and maximum loads as the aging time was increased.

40|$|The {{fatigue life}} of full-penetration and partial-penetration 5 and 25 mm {{thickness}} AlMg 4. 5 Mn (AA 5083) aluminium alloy butt <b>weldments</b> was investigated under (R = 0 and R= - 1) constant amplitude loading. The fatigue {{lives of the}} tested specimens were predicted using an analytical model which estimated both the crack initiation and crack growth portions of the total fatigue life. The fatigue life of partial-penetration <b>weldments</b> {{was found to be}} substantially less than that of full-penetration <b>weldments</b> because of the greater stress concentrations of the incomplete joint: penetration and the consequent absence of a substantial crack-initiation life period. Tensile mean stresses (R = 0 versus R = - 1 -test conditions) markedly reduced the fatigue life of the <b>weldments</b> studied and greatly diminished the duration of the fatigue crack growth period. The extra material provided by the weld reinforcement noticeably increased the fatigue life of the partial-penetration <b>weldments.</b> Weld angular distortion-induced bending stresses greatly affected the smaller thickness (5 mm) full-penetration <b>weldments</b> offsetting the Fatigue strength bonus anticipated for small-size <b>weldments.</b> Except for the predictions for R = - 1 full-penetration <b>weldments</b> at long life, which the analytical model underestimated, the agreement between experiment and analytical prediction was within a factor of 2, that is, as good as can be generally expected...|$|R

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of 5 mm and 25 mm aluminium-alloy butt <b>weldments</b> {{with full}} and incomplete penetration was investigated. Strain controlled fatigue {{tests of the}} 5083 aluminiu malloy base and 5183 weld metal were carried out to determine their cyclic material properties. Crack growth rate measurements were performed using center crack tension (CCT) specimens. The <b>weldments</b> with and without incomplete joint penetration (UP) were fatigue tested under constant amplitude axial loading for stress ratios of R = 0 and - 1. For the same applied stress amplitude, {{it was found that}} the fatigue life of <b>weldments</b> under R = - 1 is significant longer than under R = 0 due crack closure effects. The fatigue life of the <b>weldments</b> containing IJP was almost entirely devoted to crack gowth, while crack nucleation (and early growth) was found to be much more important for the butt <b>weldments</b> without IJP. It was found that the fatigue strength of the 5 mm <b>weldments</b> without IJP was not greater than that of t he 25 mm <b>weldments</b> without IJP as would have been expected for smaller size <b>weldments.</b> Estimates of angular distortions and calculations of induced bending stresses suggest that the performance of the 5 mm <b>weldments</b> is more affected by the bending stresses induced by weld distortions. The fatigue life of the tested specimens was predicted using an analytical model. A good agreement between the experimental and predicted fatigue lives was observed; and thus the analytical model was used to rationalize several experimental observations such as differing S-N diagram slopes for R = 0 and R = - 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} tritium on the {{fracture}} toughness properties of Type 304 L and Type 21 - 6 - 9 stainless steel <b>weldments</b> were measured. <b>Weldments</b> were tritium-charged-and-aged and then tested {{in order to}} measure the effect of the increasing decay helium content on toughness. The results were compared to uncharged and hydrogen-charged samples. For unexposed <b>weldments</b> having 8 - 12 volume percent retained delta ferrite, fracture toughness was higher than base metal toughness. At higher levels of weld ferrite, the fracture toughness decreased to values below that of the base metal. Hydrogen-charged and tritium-charged <b>weldments</b> had lower toughness values than similarly charged base metals and toughness decreased further with increasing weld ferrite content. The effect of decay helium content was inconclusive because of tritium off-gassing losses during handling, storage and testing. Fracture modes were dominated by the dimpled rupture process in unexposed <b>weldments.</b> In hydrogen and tritium-exposed <b>weldments,</b> the fracture modes depended on the weld ferrite content. At high ferrite contents, hydrogen-induced transgranular fracture of the weld ferrite phase was observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of the {{presents}} report {{is to determine the}} mechanical properties of AA 6082 -T 6 subsequent to gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and friction stir welding (FSW). Hardness testing have been carried out for the <b>weldments.</b> In addition, tensile and Charpy V-notch testing has been carried out for the unaffected base metal, the fusion/stir zone and the HAZ and HAZ/TMAZ zones, both transverse and longitudinal to the weld- ing/extrusion direction. It is concluded that HAZ softening is a major problem both in the GMA and the FS weld- ments. Still, the total width of the HAZ in the FS <b>weldments</b> is smaller compared to the GMA <b>weldments.</b> The total strength reduction for the GMA and the FS welds was 43 and 34 %, respectively. The general observations is that the FS <b>weldments</b> show slightly better mechanical properties compared to the GMA <b>weldments.</b> This is further reflected in the calculations of load-bearing capacity of the joints, showing that the FS <b>weldments</b> exhibit the highest capacity under otherwise identical conditions due to the combined effect of a lower HAZ strength reduction and a smaller HAZ width. </p...|$|R

50|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{can occur}} {{through a variety}} of mechanisms including inelastic (plastic) deformations, temperature gradients (during thermal cycle) or structural changes (phase transformation). Heat from welding may cause localized expansion, which is taken up during welding by either the molten metal or the placement of parts being welded. When the finished <b>weldment</b> cools, some areas cool and contract more than others, leaving residual stresses. Another example occurs during semiconductor fabrication and microsystem fabrication when thin film materials with different thermal and crystalline properties are deposited sequentially under different process conditions. The stress variation through a stack of thin film materials can be very complex and can vary between compressive and tensile stresses from layer to layer.|$|E
