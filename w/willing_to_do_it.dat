Hitler {{needed someone to}} keep up the pressure on Britain, and Göring was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E
25|$|Contraception can be effective, but {{may also}} have health repercussions and can be {{difficult}} (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals. Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject. Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common {{and in some cases}} animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined. A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial. A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that its genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded. Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed. This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births. Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with larger high-profile species.|$|E

The producers used trained rangers to play the soldiers in the teaser, part {{of an attempt to}} keep the show grounded in reality at all times. An 11-year-old boy was used to play the dead alien on the autopsy table. The boy's twin sister was used to play the alien on the train car. Both underwent extensive makeup including oversized dark contact lenses to create the effect of the alien eyes.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} the stages of change behavior in the regular physical activity of residents of Bogota D. C., Colombia, in 2003. Methods: The prevalence of intention or regular practice of physical activity in urban residents from I to IV socio-economical status were studied. The participants were older than 18 years old and younger than 65 years. The participants were selected through a probabilistic, three stage, stratified cluster sampling. They were interviewed with consent in their address using structured questionnaires. Results: The percentage of answer was of 78 % and 3, 000 records were considered valid; 13 % were considered precontemplates because they didnt practice regular physical activity and didnt have the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in the next six months; 24 % had the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a within a semester; 18 % were prepared to initiate it in the next month; 7 % are in the action stage because of they have been practicing during the last month; 34 % were classified as maintainers and the last 4 % quit the activity recently. Conclusions: The distribution of the stages of change in the adult population from I to IV socioeconomical status of the Capital District of Colombia are unfavorable for cardiovascular risk and for other negative comportamental factors associated with the urban life style...|$|R
