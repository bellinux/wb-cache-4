500|$|Griesemer {{said that}} a {{recurring}} theme throughout Infamous games {{that they wanted to}} continue with Second Son was the idea of [...] "modern elemental powers", variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world. Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. [...] "This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells you a lot about how you're playing the game", he explained. Fox considered that the game world's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic. [...] "Because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> sweet foundation of plausibility, you buy into the super-powered element", he explained.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the broad}} nature of the law, {{as it would have}} allowed the firing of public school {{employees}} for the way they voted or spoke their opinions in favor of gay rights, conservative Republican politicians spoke out against it. Primarily, former governor Ronald Reagan voiced his opinion, saying [...] "Prop. 6 is not needed to protect our children. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> legal protection now. It could be very costly to implement and has the potential for causing undue harm to people." [...] Reagan's statement turned public opinion against the proposition almost overnight. Gay activists were not optimistic in light of the record of voter turnout against them in the previous year, but they were overwhelmed to learn that on election day more than a million voters turned out to strike down the proposition.|$|E

They began preparations {{for their first}} post-season game on Tuesday, December 30 through Thursday, January 1, before three days of weekend rest. Roethlisberger did not practice until Monday, January 5—Tomlin stated of the injury, [...] "We will proceed slowly with him because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> luxury. But we feel comfortable with where he is relative to Sunday and where he’s capable of being next week." [...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through. Multiple Steelers stated that they would watch the games of the Wild Card round. Some including James Farrior and Ryan Clark watched as fans; however, Chris Hoke said, [...] "I will be watching the guys I am going against... That is how I watch it." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|Rousseau's unknown fate in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{was heavily}} {{discussed}} among critics. [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{felt that the}} relationship between Rousseau and Alex after their reunion remained unexplored, which made Rousseau's death a wasted opportunity for a powerful death scene. BuddyTV's Don Williams believed that Rousseau would survive, mainly because he had been waiting to see her flashback for four seasons, and thought her death would ensure it would not happen. Dan Compora from SyFy Portal was disappointed in her death scene, noting, [...] "I wasn't shocked to see Danielle get killed, but the scene felt like it was tossed in just in case this had to serve as the season finale." [...] Compora felt that Rousseau deserved more screen time in the episode leading up to her death. [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman described it as [...] "a rude and lazy {{way to get rid of}} Rousseau". John Kubicek, also of BuddyTV, found her death scene unsatisfactory, commenting, [...] "Then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> entirely tacked on scene at the end which felt so artificial, like I accidentally flipped over to a different show. While I agree Danielle Rousseau being shot with an arrow is shocking, is this really what the show has come to? Arbitrarily putting a recurring character's life in peril to pose as a cliffhanger?" ...|$|E

[...]. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> {{identified}} {{resource allocation}} strategies that maximize the achievable rate expressions. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> observed <b>that</b> if the source-relay channel quality is low, then cooperation is not beneficial and direct transmission should be preferred at high SNRs when amplify-and-forward or decode-and-forward with repetition coding is employed as the cooperation strategy. On the other hand, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen <b>that</b> relaying generally improves the performance at low SNRs. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> noted <b>that</b> DF with parallel coding provides the highest rates. Additionally, under total power constraints, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> studied power allocation between {{the source and}} relay. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> again pointed out that relaying degrades the performance at high SNRs unless DF with parallel channel coding is used and the source-relay channel quality is high. The benefits of relaying is again demonstrated at low SNRs. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> noted <b>that</b> nonoverlapped transmission is superior compared to overlapped one in this regime. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> considered the energy efficiency in the low-power regime and proved that the bit energy increases without bound as SNR diminishes. Hence, operation at very low SNR levels should be avoided. From the energy efficiency perspective, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> again observed <b>that</b> nonoverlapped transmission provides better performance. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> also noted <b>that</b> DF is more energy efficient than AF.|$|R
