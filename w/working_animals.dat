5|$|Individuals of the Asian {{species have}} been often trained as <b>working</b> <b>animals.</b> In the forests of Myanmar, for example, {{elephants}} have {{played a critical role}} in sustainable logging. Under the guidance of their handlers, elephants are used to manipulate and drag heavy teak logs from road-less areas to rivers and roads. From there, the valuable logs are shipped to commercial mills.|$|E
5|$|Wild wolves are {{sometimes}} kept as exotic pets and, in some rarer occasions, as <b>working</b> <b>animals.</b> Although {{closely related to}} domesticated dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, and generally, much more work is {{required in order to}} obtain the same amount of reliability. Wolves also need much more space than dogs, about , so they can exercise.|$|E
5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E
50|$|A pet or {{companion}} animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, and/or entertainment {{rather than as}} a <b>working</b> <b>animal,</b> sport animal, livestock, or laboratory animal. Popular pets are often noted for their attractive appearances, and their loyal or playful personalities.|$|R
50|$|A working rat is any rat {{which is}} trained for {{specific}} tasks as a <b>working</b> <b>animal.</b> In many cases, working rats are domesticated brown rats. However, other species, notably the Gambian pouched rat, {{have also been}} trained to assist humans.|$|R

5|$|Elephants {{have been}} <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> {{since at least}} the Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E
5|$|The Marsh Tacky {{is known}} by owners for its stamina {{and ability to}} work in water and swamps without panicking. They tend to be sure-footed, sturdy, smart, and able to survive in {{challenging}} coastal environments, {{as well as being}} easy keepers. Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women, but they were also used as <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> due to their abilities in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E
5|$|African {{elephants}} {{are listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.|$|E
50|$|A {{pack saddle}} is any device {{designed}} to be secured {{on the back of}} a horse, mule, or other <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> so it can carry heavy loads such as luggage, firewood, small cannons or other weapons too heavy to be carried by humans.|$|R
5|$|Some foods {{were also}} off-limits, as the Tang court {{encouraged}} {{people not to}} eat beef (since the bull was a valuable <b>working</b> <b>animal),</b> and from 831 to 833 Emperor Wenzong of Tang even banned the slaughter of cattle {{on the grounds of}} his religious convictions to Buddhism.|$|R
50|$|A {{pack animal}} or beast of burden is an {{individual}} or type of <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> used by humans as means of transporting materials by attaching them so their weight bears on the animal's back, in contrast to draft animals which pull loads but do not carry them.|$|R
5|$|The Limousin breed {{was also}} not immune to the wave of Anglomania {{affecting}} France {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. Some wealthy farmers maintained Durham cattle, which were prized by the elite of the time. However, this practice was criticised by the agricultural society of Limoges. The society encouraged farmers to continue selecting animals that were most consistent with the characteristics of the Limousin breed, which was perfectly adapted to the region's environment, rather than trying to adapt other breeds. Furthermore, the vast majority of Limousin breeders could not afford to raise livestock in addition to their <b>working</b> <b>animals,</b> as was the case on larger properties that practiced crossing with Durham cattle.|$|E
25|$|Rats {{have been}} used as <b>working</b> <b>animals.</b> Tasks for working rats include the {{sniffing}} of gunpowder residue, demining, acting and animal-assisted therapy.|$|E
25|$|Diapers and diaperlike {{products}} are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or <b>working</b> <b>animals.</b> This is often {{due to the}} animal not being housebroken, or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.|$|E

25|$|Domesticated ponies of all breeds {{originally}} developed {{mainly from the}} need for a <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> that could fulfill specific local draft and transportation needs while surviving in harsh environments. The usefulness of the pony was noted by farmers who observed that a pony could outperform a draft horse on small farms.|$|R

25|$|Duck Tollers are <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> and are happiest {{when they}} have a job to do. Tollers are {{excellent}} hunting companions. They excel at many types of sporting competitions, such as agility, dock diving and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, drive to work, and small size, make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance and a love for water.|$|E
25|$|Archaeology {{shows that}} the Visigoths, unlike the Ostrogoths, were {{predominantly}} farmers. They sowed wheat, barley, rye, flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as <b>working</b> <b>animals,</b> and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine, and cooking-oil.|$|E
25|$|Military {{animals are}} creatures {{that have been}} {{employed}} by humankind for use in warfare. They are a specific application of <b>working</b> <b>animals.</b> Examples include horses, dogs and dolphins. Only recently has the involvement of animals in war been questioned, and practices such as using animals for fighting, as living bombs (as {{in the use of}} exploding donkeys) or for military testing purposes (such as during the Bikini atomic experiments) may now be criticised for being cruel.|$|E
50|$|A working dog is a canine <b>working</b> <b>animal,</b> i.e., {{a type of}} {{dog that}} {{is not merely a}} pet but learns and {{performs}} tasks to assist and/or entertain its human companions, or a breed of such origin. In Australia and New Zealand, a working dog is one which has been trained to work livestock, irrespective of its breeding.|$|R
40|$|Animal {{energy is}} a {{renewable}} and sustainable source of energy. It is renewable because the animals can be reproduced by breeding and rearing the required number of animals. It is sustainable because the animals derive their energy for work largely from agricultural by-products. In addition, {{there are other}} environmental contributions of the <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> stock â€” consider replacing it by agricultural machinery run on fossil-fuel. Animal energy saves natural resources, fossil fuel and prevents green house gases emission. The fossil-fuel equivalent of the animal energy used in the Indian agriculture has been found pretty large, as much as 19 million tonnes of diesel in 2003. If this much amount of fuel were to be burnt through combustion to run tractors {{in the absence of}} the <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> stock of over 60 million, it would have released about 6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.

25|$|Pony breeds have {{developed}} {{all over the}} world, particularly in cold and harsh climates where hardy, sturdy <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> were needed. They are remarkably strong for their size. Breeds such as the Connemara pony, are recognized {{for their ability to}} carry a full-sized adult rider. Pound for pound ponies can pull and carry more weight than a horse. Draft-type ponies are able to pull loads significantly greater than their own weight, with larger ponies capable of pulling loads comparable to those pulled by full-sized draft horses, and even very small ponies able to pull as much as 450 percent of their own weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{depopulated}} {{and apparently}} primevally wild Africa seen in wildlife documentary films {{was formed in}} the 19th century by disease, a combination of rinderpest and the tsetse fly. In 1887, the rinderpest virus was accidentally imported in livestock brought by an Italian expeditionary force to Eritrea. It spread rapidly, reaching Ethiopia by 1888, the Atlantic coast by 1892, and South Africa by 1897. Rinderpest, a cattle plague from central Asia, killed over 90% of the cattle of the pastoral peoples such as the Masai of east Africa. With no native immunity, most of the population – some 5.5 million cattle – died in southern Africa. Pastoralists were left with no animals, their source of income; farmers were deprived of their <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> for ploughing and irrigation. The pandemic coincided with a period of drought, causing widespread famine. The starving human populations died of smallpox, cholera, typhoid and diseases imported from Europe. It is estimated that {{two thirds of the}} Masai died in 1891.|$|E
25|$|A paddy {{field is}} a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing semiaquatic rice. Paddy {{cultivation}} {{should not be}} confused with cultivation of deep water rice, which is grown in flooded conditions with water more than 50cm (20in) deep for at least a month. Genetic evidence shows that all forms of paddy rice, both indica and japonica, spring from a domestication of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon that first occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago South of the Yangtze River in present-day China. However, the domesticated indica subspecies currently appears to be a product of the introgression of favorable alleles from japonica at a later date, so that there are possibly several events of cultivation and domestication. Paddy fields are the typical feature of rice farming in east, south and southeast Asia. Fields can be built into steep hillsides as terraces and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes. They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for irrigation. Oxen and water buffalo, adapted for life in wetlands, are important <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> used extensively in paddy field farming.|$|E

50|$|A mill is {{a device}} that breaks solid {{materials}} into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes. There are {{many different types of}} mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g., via a hand crank), <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> (e.g., horse mill), wind (windmill) or water (watermill). Today they are usually powered by electricity.|$|R
50|$|The Dartmoor pony is a horse breed {{that has}} lived in south western England for centuries and is used {{for a variety of}} disciplines. Because of the extreme weather {{conditions}} experienced on the moors, the Dartmoor is a particularly hardy breed with excellent stamina. Over the centuries it {{has been used as a}} <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> by local tin miners and quarry workers. It is kept in a semi-feral state on Dartmoor.|$|R
25|$|Though {{there is}} {{controversy}} over the exact date horses were domesticated {{and when they were}} first ridden, the best estimate is that horses first were ridden approximately 3500 BC. Indirect evidence suggests that horses were ridden long before they were driven. There is some evidence that about 3,000 BC, near the Dnieper River and the Don River, people were using bits on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit. However, the most unequivocal early archaeological evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. Chariot burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as <b>working</b> <b>animals.</b> In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of war horses as light and heavy cavalry. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as transportation, trade and agriculture. Horses lived in North America, but died {{out at the end of}} the Ice Age. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of Columbus in 1493.|$|E
500|$|An {{interesting}} area {{of research}} in this context concerns the similarities between our relationships and those of animals, whether animals in human society (pets, <b>working</b> <b>animals,</b> even animals grown for food) or in the wild. One idea is that as people or animals perceive a social relationship as important to preserve, their conscience begins to respect that former [...] "other", and urge actions that protect it. Similarly, in complex territorial and cooperative breeding bird communities (such as the Australian magpie) that have {{a high degree of}} etiquettes, rules, hierarchies, play, songs and negotiations, rule-breaking seems tolerated on occasions not obviously related to survival of the individual or group; behaviour often appearing to exhibit a touching gentleness and tenderness.|$|E
500|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Sentient animals, Cochrane argues, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed. Whether these prima facie rights translate into concrete rights depends on the situation in question. Cochrane explores the consequences of the account in his Animal Rights Without Liberation, arguing that, with very few exceptions, nonhuman animals have a concrete rights not to be killed or made to suffer in animal testing, animal agriculture, in entertainment, for environmental purposes and in cultural practices. Despite this, because Cochrane does not posit a right against use for nonhuman animals, his account is highly permissive when contrasted with other animal rights accounts. In a 2016 article, Cochrane extended his interest-based rights approach to include labour rights for nonhuman animals, on the basis that <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> are members of our society and workers. These rights include a right to representation in a union, a right to [...] "just and favourable remuneration", a right to safe and healthy conditions of work, and a right to time off from work.|$|E
50|$|The term {{pack animal}} is {{traditionally}} used {{in contrast to}} draft animal, which is a <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> that typically pulls a load behind itself (such as a plow, a cart, a sled or a heavy log) rather than carrying cargo directly on its back. For instance, sled dogs pull loads but do not normally carry them, while working elephants {{have been used for}} centuries to haul logs out of forests.|$|R
2500|$|A gelding is a {{castrated}} horse {{or other}} equine, {{such as a}} donkey or a mule. Castration, {{as well as the}} elimination of hormonally-driven behavior associated with a stallion, allows a male horse to be calmer and better-behaved, making the animal quieter, gentler and potentially more suitable as an everyday <b>working</b> <b>animal.</b> [...] The gerund and participle [...] "gelding" [...] and the infinitive [...] "to geld" [...] refer to the castration procedure itself.|$|R
