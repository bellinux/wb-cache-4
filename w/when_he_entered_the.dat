5|$|John Henry Eaton (June 18, 1790November 17, 1856) was an American {{politician}} and diplomat from Tennessee {{who served as}} U.S. Senator and as Secretary of War {{in the administration of}} Andrew Jackson. He was 28 years old <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Senate, making him the youngest U.S. Senator in history.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm {{was nearly}} 30 years old <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> major leagues, and pitched {{until he was}} nearly 50. He retired {{with one of the}} lowest career earned run averages, 2.52, in {{baseball}} history. After retiring as a player in 1972 Wilhelm held longtime coaching jobs with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He lived in Sarasota, Florida for many years, and died there in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's {{five years}} in Ottawa were tumultuous ones. He oversaw a massive {{increase}} in Canada's naval forces and {{played a key role}} in a political crisis that threatened to tear the Liberal government and the country apart. He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King, a political leader whom Macdonald grew to loathe. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> federal cabinet in 1940, Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself. By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald's federal political career was in tatters.|$|E

Hornswoggle, who wasn't booked {{to be in the}} match, became a part of the match <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> ring as the bell rang. All the cruiserweights were out of the ring except Noble. Hornswoggle, who was under the ring for the match, entered and {{surprisingly}} and performed a Tadpole Splash on Noble. Hornswoggle went on to pin Noble to get the victory and win the Cruiserweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|At Shakur's {{sentencing}} {{hearing on}} April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33years in state prison (10 to 12 {{for the four}} counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed {{the application of the}} law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.|$|E
5|$|Born in Victoria, Wells {{began his}} career in the Australian Army in 1916 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Royal Military College, Duntroon. Graduating as a {{lieutenant}} three years later, he served in a variety of staff and instructional positions before the outbreak of the Second World War. Initially posted to the 7th Division as a staff officer in 1940, Wells was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made senior liaison officer to I Corps. Serving in Greece and North Africa, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership at El Alamein. Transferred to the South West Pacific theatre in 1943 as a brigadier, he served in the New Guinea Campaign with the headquarters of II Corps and later in the Borneo campaign with I Corps.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{was present}} in January 1164 when the king summoned a council of the barons and the bishops to Clarendon, where the king demanded that both groups swear to uphold the royal rights of Henry's grandfather, King Henry I, without any {{reservations}} or conditions. Although Becket at first attempted to resist, he eventually submitted, and then forced the other bishops to swear also. In October 1164, Becket was accused of denying justice to a royal vassal, tried at a council held at Northampton, and was found guilty {{although he did not}} accept the sentence. During the trial, Robert attempted to moderate Becket's behaviour, by persuading him from having his archiepiscopal cross, a symbol of spiritual authority, carried in front of him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> court, which would have been an insult to the king. Shortly after the trial, Robert interceded with the king to order that no injury be done to Becket, who went into voluntary exile.|$|E
5|$|Sultan did not {{initially}} have any male heirs {{and it is}} possible that Usama expected to succeed him. He certainly singled him out among his brothers by teaching him, tutoring him in the ways of war and hunting. He even favoured him for personal missions and as a representative. However, after Sultan had his own son, he no longer appreciated the presence of Usama and Murshid's other sons. According to Usama, Sultan was jealous after a particularly successful lion-hunt in 1131 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> town with a large lion head in his arms as a hunting trophy. When his grandmother saw this she warned him about the effect this could have on his uncle. However, despite this he still spoke well of his uncle on a few occasions in his autobiography and highlighted his noble actions. Usama ultimately left Shaizar temporarily in 1129 and after his father died in 1137 his exile became permanent.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, almost as good as <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E

He assumed command of the 7th Air Division (formally the Seventh Air Force) there in May 1948. In September 1948, he was appointed Commanding General of the Pacific Air Command at Hickam. On 17 June 1949, he became the Commanding General of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, California. He assumed command of the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing on 8 November 1949, commanding both wings at the base.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{received}} little playing {{time during the}} season with two dominant ball-handling guards, Curry and Monta Ellis, starring for the Warriors. He initially competed with Charlie Bell and Reggie Williams, and later Acie Law, for playing time at backup point guard. Lin started the regular season on the Warriors' inactive list, but made his NBA debut the next game during the Warriors' Asian Heritage Night. He received a standing ovation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> game in the final minutes. In the next game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Lin scored his first NBA basket, had three assists, and recorded four steals. He played 11 of his 16 minutes {{in the third quarter}} and committed five fouls but played a role in a 12–1 run by the Warriors in a 107–83 loss to the defending NBA champions. Lakers' guard Derek Fisher praised Lin for his energy and aggressiveness. At Toronto on November 8, the Raptors held Asian Heritage Night to coincide with Lin's visit with the Warriors. Over 20 members of Toronto's Chinese media covered the game. In an 89–117 road loss to the Lakers, Lin scored a (then) career-high 13 points in 18 minutes after scoring only seven total points in his first six games.|$|E

5|$|Vergne was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of one minute and 34.984 seconds was two seconds off Rosberg's pace in the second session. He {{received}} a ten-place grid penalty, his sixth of the season, because his team had changed his engine. As a result, Perez inherited eleventh position. He encountered slower cars entering the final chicane, which forced him to reduce his speed and lose brake and tyre temperature. Kvyat's final timed lap was disrupted by slower cars; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> first corner his tyres had not reached their optimum temperature, compromising his run and giving him twelfth position. Nico Hülkenberg qualified 13th after he locked his tyres at the final chicane. Adrian Sutil progressed to the second qualifying session after making balance set-up changes, and took 14th in its closing seconds. His Sauber teammate, Gutiérrez, struggled with tyre temperature and was caught in traffic on his out-lap; he took 15th. Pastor Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, but Lotus installed a new engine (his sixth of the year) in his E22 chassis on Friday morning. Like Vergne, he incurred a ten-place grid penalty (carried over to the next race because he qualified within the top-ten bottom positions). His teammate, Romain Grosjean, took over 16th position and aimed to qualify higher; however, a change in wind direction prevented him from recording a faster lap time. Ericsson and Jules Bianchi started from 17th and 18th, with Kobayashi beginning the race in 19th position. Chilton lost control of his Marussia's rear end, which caused him to start 21st.|$|E
25|$|Sutter {{qualified}} for the save in this game (even though the Cards had a 5–0 lead <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> game), since he entered with the bases loaded, meaning the potential tying run was on deck.|$|E
