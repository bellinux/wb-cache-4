5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that <b>would</b> <b>really</b> happen.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kecal is {{attempting}} to buy Jeník off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he <b>would</b> <b>really</b> do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair <b>would</b> <b>really</b> set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

25|$|Though Saddam Hussein had renounced {{the use of}} {{chemical}} weapons in 1989, many did not believe he <b>would</b> <b>really</b> honor that during a conflict with the United States and the broader coalition forces. As American troops headed to the desert, analysts speculated about their vulnerability to CB attack. Although the location of Hussein's chemical munitions was unknown, their existence was never doubted.|$|E
25|$|The {{first draft}} of the bill was printed on 6 December 1989, and {{consisted}} of 87 sections and 13 schedules spread over 115 pages. By the time the bill passed this had been extended to 125 sections and 20 schedules spread over 201 pages, mostly due {{to the discovery of}} how complex the required reforms <b>would</b> <b>really</b> be. The bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 6 December 1989 by Lord Strathmore.|$|E

25|$|Byron would pleasantly {{pretend that}} Braham called 'enthusiasm' entoozy-moozy; {{and in the}} {{extraordinary}} combination of lightness, haste, indifference and fervour with which he would pitch out that single word from his lips, accompanied with a gesture to correspond, he <b>would</b> <b>really</b> set before you the admirable singer {{in one of his}} (then) characteristic passages of stage dialogue. He did not live to see Braham become an exception in his dialogue as in his singing.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{reluctance}} initially amongst foreign governments to relocate their embassies to Belmopan {{as there was}} some doubt as to whether this inland area <b>would</b> <b>really</b> become the functioning capital. The British High Commission opened in 1981 when Belize achieved independence, moving to its current location in 1984. In February 2005, the United States government broke ground and started building a new embassy in Belmopan, 43 {{years after it was}} chosen as the new capital city. The U.S. embassy was officially opened on 11 December 2006. Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Venezuela also have embassies in Belmopan, while Ecuador, Chile, and the Dominican Republic are represented by consulates. However, with four embassies and 29 consulates the former capital of Belize City still has most of the country's foreign diplomatic community.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked with}} great rapidity and long hours, but {{he used his}} colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours {{increased}} in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on {{from day to day}} and week to week, and often from month to month.... And so the portrait <b>would</b> <b>really</b> grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually—light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. It was as if the portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.|$|E

25|$|Humphrey Lyttelton, {{primarily}} {{known as}} a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, was invited to be chairman because of {{the role played by}} improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in an utterly deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why it was funny. He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who <b>would</b> <b>really</b> rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing the house down with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show's longevity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{evidence}} of historical and recent protests {{suggests that the}} backbone of the protests are of peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanians disfranchised by liberal economic policies instituted in the country during the last decades. Specifically, previous mass protests include protests in 1989 in the city of Karak and other southern towns in the country known as April 1989 uprising (هبة نيسان) that led to reintroduction of democratic life. In 1996, bread riots erupted in Ma'an and other southern cities in Jordan as well. Both are predominantly of peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanian origins. More recently, the 2011–2012 uprising started with movements all over the country specially in towns with a predominantly east-Jordanian population known locally as Al-Hirak. Therefore, according to many analysts while protests in Amman might generates a media buzz about a revolution in Jordan, but discontent in rural Jordan among peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanians is what <b>would</b> <b>really</b> tip the scales. Regardless of identity and demographic sensitivities both groups tend to agree on the need for a more robust economy and a cure for Jordan’s crippling unemployment. However, many argue that the sensitive demographic balance in the country will ultimately decide how wide and deep political reforms will go.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} World Twenty20, Tanvir {{was on a}} one-year break because of injuries. He missed the tour of New Zealand in November 2009, the {{controversial}} tour against Australia in January 2010. He also missed the chance to participate for Pakistan in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2010 Asia Cup, and he missed the tour of England in August 2010. He recovered from injury in October 2010 and was selected {{to participate in the}} test series against South Africa under new captain Misbah-ul-Haq. The doctors however advised rest for Sohail Tanvir to help him recuperate fully from the new injury. He completely recovered from his knee injury by December and was selected for all three formats against New Zealand. He gave insights into his injury and stated at one point he couldn't even walk and that doctors thought he <b>would</b> <b>really</b> struggle to walk. However, he recovered really quickly after that and the surgery he had in Australia in January was paid off. At the last minute of the team departing for the New Zealand tour, Tanvir was replaced because the selectors thought he was not fully fit. After missing the Twenty20 Internationals the selectors recalled Tanvir after he had proved his performance in domestic games coupled with poor performances from a depleted Pakistan bowling attack.|$|E

500|$|Artist Brian Bolland's {{version of}} the Joker stemmed in part from his having {{recently}} seen the film The Man Who Laughs. Giordano's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker.

500|$|Angelina desperately embraces Edwin, {{demonstrating the}} depth of her love, and bemoans her loss – all in {{evidence}} of {{the large amount of}} damages that the jury should force Edwin to pay.

500|$|It {{was also}} Roberts' idea {{to bring back}} the Cybermen, because there were no other {{returning}} monsters in the series and he thought [...] "there should be a sense of history about the Doctor's final battle to save Earth before he heads off to meet his death".

Roberts wanted the audience to think that maybe Craig <b>would</b> <b>really</b> be converted. Moffat felt the [...] "blowing the Cybermen up with love" [...] conclusion was the Doctor Who version of a father bonding with his son. Roberts felt that the episode's depiction of the Cybermen put it on the [...] "silly/terrifying axis" [...] that was common in Doctor Who.|$|E
