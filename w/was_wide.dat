5|$|The {{neighbouring}} Russell {{family of}} Aden were concerned their land would be flooded when {{the lake was}} built, and their animosity was fully demonstrated when a bridge had to be jointly constructed by the two landowners over the River Ugie.

5000|$|Collector roads {{can vary}} widely in appearance. Some urban {{collectors}} <b>are</b> <b>wide</b> boulevards entering communities or connecting sections. Others are residential streets, which <b>are</b> typically <b>wider</b> than local roads, although few <b>are</b> <b>wider</b> than four lanes. Small-scale commercial areas {{can be found}} on collector roads in residential areas. Key community functions such as schools, churches, and recreational facilities can often be found on collector roads.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To compare spatial inequalities in life {{expectancy}} (LE) in West Central Scotland (WCS) with nine other postindustrial European regions. Design A cross-sectional observational study. Setting WCS and nine other postindustrial regions across Europe. Participants Data for WCS and nine other comparably deindustrialised European regions were analysed. Male and female LEs at birth were obtained or {{calculated for the}} mid- 2000 s for 160 districts within selected regions. Districts were stratified into two groups: small (populations of between 141   000 and 185   000 people) and large (populations between 224   000 and 352   000). The range and IQR in LE were used to describe within-region disparities. Results In small districts, the male LE range <b>was</b> <b>widest</b> in WCS and Merseyside, while the IQR <b>was</b> <b>widest</b> in WCS and Northern Ireland. For women, the LE range <b>was</b> <b>widest</b> in WCS, though the IQR <b>was</b> <b>widest</b> in Northern Ireland and Merseyside. In large districts, the range and IQR in LE <b>was</b> <b>widest</b> in WCS and Wallonia for both sexes. Conclusions Subregional spatial inequalities in LE in WCS <b>are</b> <b>wide</b> compared with other postindustrial mainland European regions, especially for men. Future research could explore the contribution of economic, social and political factors in reducing these inequalities. </p...|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Danny Coale's 143receiving yards were a career-high {{and set a}} championship-game record. Many of those receiving yards came on third down and were a reason why Tech converted 13 of its 17third-down opportunities, setting another championship-game record. Florida State's leading receiver <b>was</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Taiwan Easterling, who had sixcatches for 79yards. Close behind <b>was</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Willie Haulstead, who had three receptions for 73yards. All of Haulstead's receptions came in the first half, setting a record for receiving yards in an ACC Championship Game half.|$|E

5|$|One of Vick's {{favorite}} {{targets in}} the limited Tech passing attack <b>was</b> <b>wide</b> receiver André Davis, who caught 24 passes for 318 yards and two touchdowns.

A 27-yard pass from Brumbaugh to Van Sickel got the Gators out of bounds at the 1-yard line. Crabtree ran it in for the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point <b>was</b> <b>wide</b> and short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, claim it was blocked.|$|E

5|$|The Giants' 12–4 {{record in}} 1989 was the NFC's second-best (only to San Francisco's 14–2 record) They lost their divisional playoff game in {{overtime}} to the Rams, 19–13. The {{highlight of the}} game <b>was</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass. After catching the ball, Anderson made a long run to the end zone, silencing the crowd in attendance. In 1989, free-agent acquisition Ottis Anderson ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes.

5|$|Weinke's {{favorite}} target <b>was</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Peter Warrick, who led all Seminole receivers with 71receptions and 931yards in {{just nine}} games {{during the regular}} season. Five times, Warrick earned more than 100receiving yards in a game.

5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 1988, the Giants started the 1989 season 8–1 and did not allow more than 24 points in any game.

The division clinching season finale was highlighted by kick returner Dave Meggett's first career punt return for a touchdown. Though many people predicted an NFC Championship showdown between the Giants and the 49ers, the Giants lost their divisional playoff game to the Rams 19–13 in overtime. The highlight of the game <b>was</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass over cornerback Mark Collins.
