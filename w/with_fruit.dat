5|$|Radishes {{are mostly}} used in salads, but also appear in many European dishes. Radish leaves are {{sometimes}} used in recipes, like potato soup or as a sauteed side dish. They {{are also found}} blended <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> juices in some recipes.|$|E
5|$|Based on its size, the {{morphology}} of its molars, and microwear {{analysis on}} its teeth, Babakotia radofilai was likely a folivore, while supplementing its diet <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> and hard seeds. In all sloth lemurs, including Babakotia radofilai, the permanent teeth erupted early, a trait seen in indriids that improves survivability of juveniles {{during the first}} dry season following weaning.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 {{the town}} was {{described}} as having an antique appearance, with its principal trade being salt, along <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetables, and small silk and heavy cotton works. The town had one bank and one newspaper. By 1911 the Encyclopædia Britannica mentions the existence of chemical works and the manufacture of condensed milk.|$|E
5|$|Soft white cheese, gvina levana, {{is often}} {{referred}} to by its fat content, such as 5% or 9%. It is eaten plain, or mixed <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> or vegetables, spread on bread or crackers and used in a variety of pies and pastries.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetable matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields {{during the summer}} months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E

5|$|Being saprobic, P. flammans {{is found}} {{exclusively}} on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of coniferous trees, <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies appearing in tufts or singly, from summer to autumn. It is a fungus {{with a wide}} geographical distribution in boreal and temperate regions, and may be considered common to rare depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.|$|E
5|$|During data {{collection}} for The Banksia Atlas project, a single presumed natural hybrid between B.prionotes and B.lindleyana (porcupine banksia), <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> like B.lindleyana but leaves intermediate {{between the two}} parents, was found north of Kalbarri National Park. At the time this was considered an important discovery, as the parent species were thought not to be closely related. Mast's analyses, however, place them both in a clade of eight species, though B.lindleyana remains less closely related to B.prionotes than B.hookeriana. Hybrids of B.prionotes with B.menziesii (firewood banksia) have also been produced by artificial means, and presumed natural hybrids have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|From Beckford's {{house in}} Lansdown Crescent {{to the tower}} a series of {{interlinked}} gardens were laid out which became known as Beckford's Ride. Nearest the crescent was a terraced Italianate garden and then a plantation of conifers. Above the plantation was a quarry garden and dyke garden before entering a grotto tunnel under a track. The tunnel lead into the tower garden. Specialist planting included: Pinus arborea, Royal Fern (Osmunda regalis) and Cistus alpina. These were to encourage bird species including nightingales, linnets and thrushes. The old quarry {{was made into a}} walled garden <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> and vegetables.|$|E

5|$|In September 1998, Odwalla {{began to}} sell energy bars made <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> and grains, named food bars, as an {{alternative}} to its drinks in an attempt to raise revenue following the 1996 E.coli outbreak. The first three flavors released were Cranberry Citrus, Organic Carrot & Raisin, and Peach Crunch, all three of which are now discontinued. Within eight weeks of their release, the Odwalla Bar was one of the top-selling energy bar brands in the market. The bars {{come in a variety of}} flavors, and weigh 2 ounces (56grams) per bar. As of 2001, before Odwalla was acquired by Coca-Cola, food bars accounted for less than five percent of Odwalla's revenue.|$|E
5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, <b>with</b> <b>fruit,</b> hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E

5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants <b>with</b> <b>fruit</b> greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E
5|$|The east range, of c.1635, {{comprises}} a long, narrow building, {{with a short}} {{projecting wing}} to the south-east. It is {{the only part of}} the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among other furniture. In the south-east wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated <b>with</b> <b>fruit,</b> foliage, and heraldic emblems. The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on one corner. The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.|$|E
