2500|$|Because of the {{geographic}} situation of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean, the island has {{an abundance of}} fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are espada (black scabbardfish), blue fin tuna, <b>white</b> <b>marlin,</b> blue marlin, albacore, bigeye tuna, wahoo, spearfish, skipjack tuna and many others {{are found in the}} local dishes as they are found up and down the coast of Madeira. [...] Espada is often served with banana. Bacalhau is also popular, as it is in Portugal.|$|E
50|$|Compared to striped or <b>white</b> <b>marlins</b> and sailfish, black marlins {{are more}} solid than their blue counterparts. They have a shorter bill and a rounder and lower dorsal fin. Black marlin may be {{distinguished}} from all other marlin species by their rigid pectoral fins, which, especially from a weight of around 150 lb (75 kg) or so, are unable to be pressed flat against their sides.|$|R

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> {{are near}} the top of the food chain and will consume {{anything}} they can find that is manageable for their size. Schooling flyingfish, small tuna, dolphinfish (mahi-mahi, dorado), and squid are the preferred prey of <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b> <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> have two ways of foraging for food. One way <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> obtain food is by help of other predators. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> usually keep to themselves but will socialize with other apex predators in order to increase the efficiency of foraging. Another way <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> obtain food is by diving down in a V- or U- shaped parabola to about 200 m in search for food that is not at the surface. In order to survive in these lower temperatures and darker environments, <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> have evolved to have larger eyes and a way to selectively warm their eye and brain tissue.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> are ram {{ventilators}} {{which means}} {{they have to be}} constantly moving in order to breathe. Since <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> have to constantly move to stay alive, many have made long transatlantic journeys. Ortiz and his colleagues tracked one <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> for 474 days and reported that the fish resurfaced 6,517 km (4,083 miles) from where it was tagged.|$|E
50|$|From around mid-July onwards, <b>white</b> <b>marlin,</b> {{as well as}} {{the other}} species of Gulf Stream gamefish such as dolphinfish, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna, start showing up in the {{continental}} shelf canyons offshore of Maryland, Virginia and Delaware. The Jack Spot, an area of bottom structure 22 mi south of Ocean City, Maryland, was for many years the most famed <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> location in the United States. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> were first caught here as early as 1934, and in 1939, 171 whites were boated in a single day (July 29) here.

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of K. albida begins with a large {{spawning}} in warm tropical waters near the equator. Researchers have assessed that each female can lay 190,000 to 586,000 eggs. The Gulf of Mexico, Mona Passage, Southwest Bermuda, and Northwest Grand Bahama Island are few location have been located as prime spawning ground for <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b> <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> return to the warm shallow equatorial waters each year to spawn for the new generation. Growth of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> is very rapid, with males reaching sexual maturity at only 153.2 cm LJFL and females becoming sexually mature at 189.9 cm LJFL. The lifespan of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> {{has been identified as}} 15 or more years.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> are mid-sized {{billfish}} with a {{bill that}} is round in cross section, and distinctly forked caudal fin. Their body structure is designed for fast swimming with a long streamline appearance. The length of K. albida is measured from the lower jaw to the fork of the tail (lower-jaw fork length; LJFL). The largest <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> reported was 2.8 m (9.2 ft) LJFL and weighed over 82 kg (180.8 lb). The coloring of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> is used as countershading, with a dark blue dorsal side and a dirty white ventral side. Even though all <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> have the same coloring pattern, they are sexually dimorphic with the females usually larger. One of the most noticeable features of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> is the dorsal fin, which extends along {{the majority of the}} dorsal portion of its body. The dorsal fin consists of an average of 28 to 46 rays. These rays make up a fin that is tall and rounded in the anterior but quickly levels off and then decrease as it extends to the posterior. Behind the large primary dorsal fin is the secondary dorsal fin which is made up of five to six rays. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> have a set of similar pectoral fins and pelvic fins. These two sets of fin are rounded and wide at the tip. They also contain two anal fins which can be used for identification between species (more in Identification). The lateral line on this species is prominent, with a hump above the pectoral fin and extends the length of the fish toward the caudal fin.Internally, <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> do not have a swim bladder, but instead have small bubble shaped chambers that act as a swim bladder. Similarly to most vertebrates, they have symmetrical gonads. Unlike other marine fish, <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> do not have gill rakers which are involved in suspension feeding. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> do have small but sharp teeth that are used when eating fish and Cephalopods.|$|E

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> are {{commonly}} misidentified as roundscale spearfish (Tetrapturus georgii). This likely caused a miscount {{of the population}} size of <b>white</b> <b>marlin</b> and roundscale spearfish before they were determined genetically different in 2001. Differentiation between the two species {{can be done with}} close external examination. As described in the name, roundscale spearfish have a broadband, round anterior end of their scales. <b>White</b> <b>marlin</b> scales are more rigid and rounded on the posterior region of the scale. Another way to identify between the two species without doing a genetic test is by looking at the distance between the anal opening and the anal fin. In roundscale spearfish, the anal opening is further way from the anal fin (greater than half the length of the anal fin) {{than it is in the}} <b>white</b> <b>marlin.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Life with Luigi premiered on CBS in 1948 and {{centered}} around Luigi Basco, an Italian immigrant living in Chicago. Many of the plots were either about Luigi attending “citizenship classes” and the wacky immigrants he meets there or about his cranky landlord {{trying to convince}} Luigi to marry his overweight daughter. The TV version premiered in 1952 and was cancelled shortly after. It was cancelled due to the bumbling helpless portrayal of a character {{often referred to as}} “the little immigrant” who didn’t understand how banks work even though there are probably banks in Italy.Mama (alternately “I Remember Mama”) was a series about a Norwegian family living in San Francisco, CA starring Peggy Wood, Judson Laire and Rosemary Rice.Beulah was a radio series on CBS from 1945-1954 and a TV show on ABC from 1950-1952. It was the first series to feature an African American woman in the main role. Beulah drew much of the same criticism from the black community as Amos N Andy. The show was criticized for its portrayal of the “Mammy” or the happy go lucky black servant who wanted nothing more from life than to serve white folks. When it first hit the radio waves, the character of Beulah was voiced by the <b>white</b> voice actor, <b>Marlin</b> Hurt. After his death in 1946, the character of Beulah was played by Bob Corley, another white man. In 1947, African American actress Hattie McDaniel took over, followed by two beautiful African American sisters Lillian Randolph and later Amanda Randolph.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, catch and effort data from 40, 332 sets {{done by the}} Brazilian tuna {{longline}} fleet (national and chartered vessels), from 1986 to 2007, in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean, were used to generate standardized CPUE series, by GLM, assuming 3 different error distributions: Negative Binomial, Poisson and Delta-lognormal. Four explanatory factors were considered in all three approaches: Year, Distance from coast, area, month and also the interactions between Year and Month and Year and Area. The sailfish catch, from 1986 to 2006, accounted for only 1. 7 % of the total catch, varying between 0. 4 %, in 1990, and 4. 7 %, in 2005. The mean percentage of fishing sets with no sailfish catch was very high (78 %) ranging from 56 %, in 2004, to 93 %, in 1994. The Poisson model explained 18. 6 % of the total deviance, while the Negative Binomial model accounted for 16. 9 %. The Delta-lognormal model, in turn, explained 16. 8 % of the total deviance, for the positive sets, and 58. 5 % for the proportion of positives. The sailfish CPUE seemed to fluctuate around 0. 4 fish per thousand hooks, until 2001 (mean of 0. 39, ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 72). During 2004 and 2005, however, an abrupt increase in CPUE was observed, with values more than doubling. In 2006, the CPUE again dropped to 0. 55, {{going back to the}} range of the previous period. Although the reasons for the sudden increase of sailfish CPUE in 2004 / 2005 are not clear, {{it is possible that the}} introduction of new fishing logsheets, in October 2003, as well as the prohibition of sales of <b>white</b> and blue <b>marlin,</b> from July 2002 on, may have contributed to introduce an unquantifiable bias in CPUE values during these years.
