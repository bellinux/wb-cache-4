5|$|France {{was willing}} to commit to a launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious. The UK {{government}} was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by British Aerospace (BAe) and estimated at ₤250million, it was postponed for three years. On 1 March 1984 {{the government and the}} manufacturer agreed that ₤50million <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> whether the A320 would fly or not, while the rest <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> as a levy on each aircraft sold.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, 2007, GO Transit {{announced}} {{a plan to}} put dedicated bus lanes on the centre median of the parkway, to allow its buses to bypass traffic congestion and promote buses {{as an alternative to}} automobiles. The $12 million plan <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for by GO. The plan would require testing of soil conditions and an environmental assessment.|$|E
50|$|Karimi joined newly {{promoted}} Steel Azin on 29 July 2009 on {{a one-year}} deal. He <b>would</b> reportedly <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> US$400,000 for the season.|$|R
50|$|Embree {{signed a}} five-year {{contract}} in 2011 starting at $725,000 annually plus incentives. The guaranteed portion was $250,000 base, $200,000 media, $200,000 sponsorship, and $75,000 for football camps. Bonuses were for team development (on and off-field) and team performance. Had he been terminated in 2011, Embree <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> $750,000. The contract stated he <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> $500,000 for being fired in 2012. Had he been terminated in 2013, he <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> $250,000. CU <b>was</b> to give no money {{if he had been}} fired in 2014 or 2015.|$|R
50|$|Weingarten also {{sponsored}} the 1997 New Jersey welfare reform law that mandates welfare benefits <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> to recipients if they actively seek employment or attend educational training programs.|$|R
5|$|On {{taking office}} Grant's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit, which the Republican Congress had just passed. It ensured that all public debts, {{particularly}} war bonds, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> only in gold {{rather than in}} greenbacks. The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $130 per ounce – the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; {{in return for the}} safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> to the Ottomans. Unfortunately for the Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{link road}} between the M54 and the M6 Toll (M6 {{junction}} 11a) were supported in principle by the Secretary of State for Transport in 2003 and {{were put on}} display in 2006 with an expected construction date of 2012. The £102m cost for the scheme <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for by The Macquarie Infrastructure Group (the company that owns Midland Expressway Ltd and operates the M6 Toll).|$|E
5000|$|Retroactive Eligibility: Would apply retroactively to {{everyone}} who has exhausted all of their previous tiers in recent months. However, benefits <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> retroactively. (Example: a claimant who exhausted his or her benefits three months ago <b>would</b> <b>be</b> eligible to begin Tier 5 at the date of enactment. He or she <b>would</b> not, however, <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> out for the three months in which no benefits were received. If a claimant is going to exhaust benefits in two weeks, {{he or she will}} move right onto Tier 5 and receive 20 weeks of benefits.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Ironmen {{revived the}} spirits of a {{depressed}} fan base and turned Iowa's financial fortunes around. A few years later, the athletic department <b>would</b> <b>be</b> out of financial danger, and the debt on Iowa Stadium <b>would</b> finally <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> off.|$|R
50|$|Sebastian Shaw {{contacted}} Otomo in Japan {{and ordered}} that he destroy X-51 for him. Otomo agreed, but noted that afterward, his debt <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered <b>paid</b> in full.|$|R
5|$|The {{last two}} {{conditions}} {{were the most}} controversial, though after {{one and a half}} years, a compromise was reached: only buildings actually in use would be repaired, and pensions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid,</b> but only when the officers actually retired. The British authorities authorised minimal repairs, to be made as cheaply as possible. The transfer was intended to be completed by the end of 1885, but was not finalised until 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not unusual}} that Ross, an upholsterer, <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to sew flags. There was a sudden and urgent need for them, and other Philadelphia upholsterers <b>were</b> also <b>paid</b> to sew flags in 1777 and years following.|$|R
5000|$|On November 6, 2007, the Indians {{exercised}} his $4 million club option, {{opting to}} bring him back in 2008. [...] Had the team declined Borowski's option, he <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> a $250,000 buyout.|$|R
50|$|The tour {{fell apart}} {{on the road}} as headliners Carly Simon, Norah Jones, Kelly Clarkson, The Go-Go's, and Queen Latifah {{dropped out of the}} tour, fearing that they <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for their performances.|$|R
5|$|Her first {{position}} as a professor was at Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1963. The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> less than her male colleagues {{because she had a}} husband with a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Immigrant {{communities}} {{first developed}} in the riverside settlements. From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships' crews were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crew would be found wherever they were available, local sailors being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in foreign ports. Crews <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> off {{at the end of}} their voyage. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of Lascars and Africans from the Guinea Coast. Large Chinatowns at both Shadwell and Limehouse developed, associated with the crews of merchantmen in the opium and tea trades. It was only after the devastation of the Second World War that this predominantly Han Chinese community relocated to Soho.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} {{the feasibility of}} building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as {{they did not believe}} it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.|$|E

5|$|The Lowell System {{combined}} large-scale mechanization with {{an attempt}} to improve the stature of its female workforce and workers. A few girls who came with their mothers or older sisters were as young as ten years old, some were middle-aged, but the average age was about 24. Usually hired for contracts of one year (the average stay was about four years), new employees were given assorted tasks as spare hands and paid a fixed daily wage while more experienced loom operators <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> by the piece. They were paired with more experienced women, who trained them {{in the ways of}} the factory.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the burh walls is recorded in a charter witnessed by King Alfred, which lays out {{the responsibilities of the}} various churchmen and nobles involved, and notes that the upkeep of the walls <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> for out of a share of taxes on a new market and on the new streets. The local lords took responsibility for building the burh wall, which unusually for the period was not built on royal lands. During the 10th century, the documents on the burh suggest that the aristocratic thegns living around Worcester also owned and maintained buildings within the walls; Creighton and Higham suggest that these may have been linked to their responsibilities for defending the settlement.|$|E
5|$|The {{downward}} {{trend in the}} number of unskilled jobs available throughout the country is continuing. The government believes that the extension of compulsory education until the age of 18 will mean many more young people will leave education in a much better position to find skilled employment. Speaking in March 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown stated that around 50,000 teenagers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> a training allowance to sign up to college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of apprenticeships available to double to around 500,000 by 2020, with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.|$|E

5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company {{had no other}} assets and {{it was reported that}} it was seeking to speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
5|$|Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service {{announced}} on 1 October 1993 {{that the two}} companies would merge from 1 January 1994. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> with NOK225 million in Helikopter Service shares. The Norwegian Competition Authority stated {{they would have to}} look at the merger, since the new company would have an almost-monopoly on offshore flights. However, the ministry stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on 14 December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received 14% of the shares in the merged company. They were immediately sold, giving Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi a NOK170 million profit on the five-year venture.|$|E
25|$|Attendance for {{series was}} disappointing—down more than 50 percent in {{comparison}} with the previous year's series.
