These problems are generally studied in [7 – 15]. In these <b>works,</b> <b>quality</b> of service (QoS) guarantees are not considered. In [7], the authors considered relay selection and subcarrier assignment for cooperative OFDMA systems. They took the fairness constraints into their model and solve the throughput maximization problem optimally by an algorithm from graph theory. The authors in [8] considered the scheduling problem in cooperative OFDMA bidirectional cellular networks. They formulated a combinatorial optimization problem using the graph theory and proposed a heuristic algorithm to jointly optimize subcarrier assignment, transmission mode selection and relay selection for the system total throughput maximization. These two graph theory-based algorithms have the limitation that they cannot perform the optimization of power allocation. The authors in [9] incorporated power allocation into the model and studied the scheduling problem for system utility maximization; a dual decomposition algorithm was proposed to the problem. The optimality of the obtained solution is guaranteed by the time-sharing condition established in [10, 11].|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to show new {{approach}} regarding the implementation of new technological changes for the construction <b>works</b> <b>quality</b> perception. Although, the European economic environment is not yet characterized by a real free market, the actions of the contemporary market determine specific behaviour of the organisations with the prevalence of competition for resources and customers where quality plays an important part. The interest for these systems is transferred from the production sector to services and educational system. Still, the design and organization of quality management systems first imply the definition of quality. Quality, as well as freedom or justice, is a rather difficult concept to define since it has a high degree of relativity. The evolution of society determined the personalization of the way the concept of quality is perceived. Every individual has an instinctive understanding of what quality means, whereas the perceptions are definitely different. The researchers show these fundamental perceptions of quality and tried to decrease the subjective idea that quality is associated with the idea of good and is therefore used to justify or validate an activity or object without paying much attention to the exact meaning of the word...|$|E

To accomplish this purpose, two different survey methods were used. A convenience sample of 125 sports officials participated in a qualitative questionnaire.

Utilizing both the qualitative research and information gathered from relevant literature, a web-based survey was constructed and used to contact selected members of the Texas Association of Sports Officials. A total of 1075 responses were received. The web-based instrument integrated items related to basic demographic information, as outlined by Quinn and Staines, (1979). These items included, but were not limited to the following: gender, age, economic information, marital status, educational background, ethnic background and primary occupation. The instrument also investigated the following indicators of work quality: Vocational and avocational information, work environment, personal health and wellbeing, organizational and administrative support, and organizational commitment and officiating career outcomes. These indicators were further explored through the development of <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> constructs, which related to each indicator.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{large body}} of {{international}} research reveals that single mothers experience poorer mental health than their partnered counterparts, with socioeconomic disadvantage identified as an important contributory factor in understanding this health disparity. Much less research, however, has focused specifically on the psychological well-being of single mothers who are employed, despite their growing presence in the labor force. Of the research which has considered employment, the {{focus has been on}} employment status per se rather than on other important work-related factors which may impact psychological health, such as psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> and work-family conflict. The aim of this study was to: (1) compare employed single mothers and employed partnered mothers on measures of psychological distress, psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> and work-family conflict; and (2) explore the potential role of work-family conflict and psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> as explanations for any observed differences in psychological distress based on partner status. Method Analysis of data obtained from a cross-sectional telephone survey of employed parents in a mid-sized Western Canadian city. Analyses were based on 674 employed mothers (438 partnered and 236 single), who were 25 - 50 years old, with at least one child in the household. Results Compared to employed single mothers, employed partnered mothers were older, had more education and reported fewer hours of paid work. Single mothers reported higher levels of psychological distress, financial hardship, work-family conflict and poor psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>quality.</b> Statistical adjustment for income adequacy, psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> and work-family conflict each independently resulted in single motherhood no longer being associated with psychological distress. Conclusions While single employed mothers did experience higher levels of psychological distress than their partnered counterparts, differences between these groups of women in income adequacy, psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>quality,</b> and work-family conflict were found to explain this relationship. Future research employing a longitudinal design and subject to lower selection biases is required to tease out the interrelationship of these three life strains and to point to the most appropriate economic and social policies to support single mothers in the workforce. </p...|$|R

This paper offers {{new insights into the}} relationship between the performance of chain flail delimbing and debarking and such factors as tree volume, load volume, tree form and bark-wood bond strength (BWBS). The study was conducted in Chile, during the commercial harvesting of a Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantation.

The analysis of these data shows that productivity is affected primarily by load volume. <b>Work</b> <b>quality</b> is affected by BWBS and by the number of trees in a load. <b>Work</b> <b>quality</b> degrades with increasing BWBS and tree number, since more trees tend to shield each other.

40|$|We examine work flows, task complexity, and <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> {{associated}} with a crucial innovation-related activity—the filing of patent applications. For innovating firms, patent filings involve an interesting tradeoff between <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> and speed, as delays could lead to loss of priority, while errors due to speeding up could lead to rejections or longer reviews. Using data on almost 3 million utility patents granted between 1976 and 2009 and about 1. 9 million applications applied between 2001 and 2010, we document three novel empirical regularities. First, we find striking deviations from uniform filing volumes, with significant month-end, quarter-end, and year-end clustering of patent applications. A number of empirical tests, as well as interviews with patent attorneys, strongly suggest that these clustering patterns are induced by reporting and planning deadlines at corporates and patent law firms. Second, we find evidence for higher complexity of close-to-deadline applications. Third, we find that measures of <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> are systematically lower for filings close to deadlines. We conclude by presenting and calibrating a model that reconciles the observed patterns as arising from agents responding to discontinuous incentives around deadlines. Our calibration exercise suggests that earlier priority-date benefits due to task acceleration around month-ends {{are unlikely to be}} very significant relative to the extent of decline in <b>work</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|R

Therefore, the novel aspects of this paper are the following: (i) The integration between the NPCA-RSM and SEM-GME, which allows reduction of the variables analysed and evaluation of the measurement errors; (ii) The formalization of a Job Satisfaction Model for the study of the relationships between the subjective <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> latent factors in the Italian social services sector...|$|R
