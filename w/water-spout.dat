6000|$|... "Well, let's get {{as high as}} {{possible}} anyhow!" [...] said Mr. Polly, urging her gently upward. [...] "Shinning up a <b>water-spout</b> in your line? Near as you'll get to Heaven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} thing that {{troubles}} me," [...] said I: [...] "how are we to gauge or estimate the force of our <b>water-spout</b> so as to regulate our mill when made? Do you understand such matters--the measurement of force-- Coppet?" ...|$|E
60|$|In far-off, endless vistas, colonnades of <b>water-spouts</b> were seen: all heaven's dome {{upholding}} {{on their}} shafts: and bright forms gliding {{up and down}} within. So at Luz, in his strange vision, Jacob saw the angels.|$|R
60|$|The fork-lightning flashed and scintillated {{from every}} {{quarter of the}} horizon: the thunder broke over the Castle, as if the keep were rocking with artillery: amid the {{momentary}} pauses of the explosion, the rain was heard descending like dissolving <b>water-spouts.</b>|$|R
60|$|It glistened darkly in the wet, the dim lamps flickered {{with each}} gust, the rain splashed {{steadily}} into the puddles and trickled down the <b>water-spouts</b> into the running gutters. A few soaked wayfarers hurried past, crouching beneath their dripping umbrellas, the women holding up their skirts.|$|R
6000|$|KING. [...] "'Oh, {{you could}} not miss us even by grope. That big hollow that goes from Burg, and even from Potschappel,--it would have poured like a <b>water-spout</b> [or fire-spout] over us. You see, I am not so brave as you think.' ...|$|E
60|$|As in Sooloo's seas, one vast <b>water-spout</b> will, sudden, form: and whirling, {{chase the}} flying Malay keels; so, before a swift-winged cloud, a {{thousand}} prows sped by, leaving braided, foaming wakes; their crowded inmates' arms, in frenzied supplications wreathed; like tangled forest-boughs.|$|E
6000|$|On the 17th one {{of those}} majestic spectres of the deep, a <b>water-spout,</b> stalked by them, and they trembled for their lives. Young Henry set it down in his scanty journal with the judicious comment that 'it {{might have been a}} fine sight from a ship.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Chris Van Dusen's Down to the Sea: An Outdoor Adventure: Based on {{characters}} {{created by}} beloved Maine author, Chris Van Dusen, this new outdoor exhibit is an interactive adventure {{for children of}} all ages. Hop in Mr. Magee’s boat, climb on a shipwreck, and splash with <b>water-spouting</b> whales - all {{right there in the}} backyard.|$|R
50|$|At the {{marketplace}} stands the Statue of the Town’s Founder, Elector Johann Georg I of Saxony (1585-1656). It was {{carved out of}} Postelwitz sandstone in 1863 by sculptor Wilhelm Schwenk from Dresden and restored in 1984. Before it are some granite steps and a <b>water-spouting</b> bear’s head referring to the Electoral hunts in the town’s environs.|$|R
50|$|The Swann Memorial Fountain (1924), a {{fountain}} sculpture by Alexander Stirling Calder that {{is located in}} the center of Logan Circle, also known by its historic name Logan Square, in Philadelphia, contains three large Native American figures that symbolize the area’s major streams: the Delaware, the Schuylkill, and the Wissahickon. The young girl leaning on her side against an agitated, <b>water-spouting</b> swan represents the Wissahickon Creek.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's another!" [...] cried Ajo, as {{a second}} {{whistling}} shriek sounded above them. This time the bomb fell into the sea and raised a small <b>water-spout,</b> some half mile distant. They could now see plainly a second huge aircraft circling above them; but this also took flight toward the north and presently disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Maisie stared {{directly}} {{in front of her and}} did not reply. The wind of a keen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks. Overhead, the creamy- yellow smoke-clouds were thinning away one by one against a pale-blue sky, and the improvident sparrows broke off from <b>water-spout</b> committees and cab-rank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring.|$|E
6000|$|... "I used {{to sneak}} out of my window when I was a boy, so I need not disturb the aunts, and now I rather like it, for it's the {{shortest}} road, and it keeps me limber when I have no rigging to climb. Good-bye till breakfast." [...] And away he went down the <b>water-spout,</b> over the roof, and vanished among the budding honey-suckles below.|$|E
6000|$|... 9 The rain {{is taken}} from the sea by <b>water-spouts</b> or in vapour; it is wonderfully distilled, and descends upon the earth in {{fertilizing}} showers which supply the rivers. In proportion to the rain or melting of the snow, is the quantity {{of water in the}} rivers. Bunyan was taught all this phenomena of nature, by a single verse in the inspired volume which he quotes. How wonderful is that Book!--Ed.|$|R
6000|$|I now {{observed}} that the other boats had separated, and each had gone after a different whale. In {{a few minutes the}} fish we were in chase of rose a short distance off, and sent up two splendid <b>water-spouts</b> high into the air, thus showing that he was what the whalers call a [...] "right" [...] whale. It is different from the sperm whale, which has only one blow-hole, and that a little one.|$|R
5000|$|The {{horizontal}} geison {{runs around}} the full perimeter of a Greek temple, projecting {{from the top}} of the entablature to protect it from the elements and as a decorative feature. [...] Horizontal geisa may be found in other ancient structures that are built according to one of the architectural orders. The horizontal sima (with its antefixes and <b>water-spouts)</b> ran above the horizontal geison along the sides of a building, acting as a rain gutter and final decoration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Duc de Bouillon {{has lost}} his equipage; our Hussars took it at Landau [other side the Rhine, a while ago]. Here we stand in mud to the ears; fifteen of the Regiment Alt-Baden have sunk {{altogether}} in the mud. Mud comes of a <b>water-spout,</b> or sudden cataract of rain, there was in these Heidelberg Countries; two villages, Fuhrenheim and Sandhausen, it swam away, every stick of them (GANZ UND GAR).|$|E
60|$|I now {{planned a}} sort of movable buffer by which {{the force of the}} <b>water-spout</b> could be diminished or even turned aside altogether. It acted very well, and, under its protection, we set up the saw and started it. We were all {{assembled}} again, of course, at the first starting of the saw, along with a good many of our red friends, whose curiosity in our various proceedings knew no bounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} a cracksman, and a first-rate one, too; he brought me up to the business, {{beginning}} when I was very small. I don't remember havin' any mother, so I'll leave her out. My old man was very particular; he liked to see things done right. One day I was with him, and we saw a tinner nailing a new leader or tin <b>water-spout</b> {{to the side of}} a house.|$|E
6000|$|... "During these bursts {{the most}} vivid flashes of {{lightning}} continually issued from the densest part of the volcano; and the cloud of smoke now ascending to an altitude much above the highest point to which the ashes were projected, rolled off in large masses of fleecy clouds, gradually expanding themselves before the wind, in a direction nearly horizontal, and drawing up to them a quantity of <b>water-spouts,</b> which formed a most beautiful and striking addition to the general appearance of the scene." ...|$|R
60|$|The hum of {{the great}} sawmill drew me like a magnet. I {{went out to the}} lumber-yard {{at the back of the}} mill, where a trestle slanted down to a pond full of logs. A train loaded with pines had just pulled in, and dozens of men were rolling logs off the flat-cars into a canal. At {{stations}} along the canal stood others pike-poling the logs toward the trestle, where an endless chain caught them with sharp claws and hauled them up. Half-way from, the ground they were washed clean by a circle of <b>water-spouts.</b>|$|R
60|$|Alone at some {{distance}} from the wasting walls of a disused abbey I found half sunken in the grass the grey and goggle-eyed visage of one of those graven monsters that made the ornamental <b>water-spouts</b> in the cathedrals of the Middle Ages. It lay there, scoured by ancient rains or striped by recent fungus, but still looking like the head of some huge dragon slain by a primeval hero. And as I looked at it, I thought of the meaning of the grotesque, and passed into some symbolic reverie of the three great stages of art.|$|R
60|$|Not {{a latent}} echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed <b>water-spout</b> in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the {{leafless}} boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging {{of an empty}} storehouse door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] I continued, [...] "you {{see that}} we shall have no {{difficulty}} as to the dam. Then, as to the wheel, {{it will be a}} simple one of not more than four feet diameter, presented vertically to what I may term the <b>water-spout,</b> so that its axle, which will have a crank in it, will work the saw direct; thus, avoiding toothed wheels and cogs, we shall avoid friction, and, if need be, increase the speed easily, d'you see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{one of the}} {{principal}} streets was a ponderous stone tank, and a <b>water-spout</b> that supplied it, and where the tired, heated toilers from the Campagna used to rest their right hands when they bent over to put their lips to the spout, the thick stone was worn down to a broad groove an inch or two deep. Think of the countless thousands of hands that had pressed that spot in the ages that are gone, to so reduce a stone that is as hard as iron! ...|$|E
6000|$|Wept the Alruna-wife; Kissed her fair Freya-- 'Far off in {{the morning}} land High in Valhalla, A window stands open, Its sill is the snow-peaks, Its posts are the <b>water-spouts</b> Storm rack its lintel, Gold cloud-flakes above it Are piled for the roofing. Far up to the Elfin-home, High in the wide-blue. Smiles out each morning thence Odin Allfather; From under the cloud-eaves, Smiles out on the heroes, Smiles out on chaste housewives all, Smiles on the brood-mares, Smiles on the smith's work: And theirs is the sword-luck, With them is the glory-- So Odin hath sworn it-- ...|$|R
5000|$|In 186, Emperor Ling tasked the eunuchs Song Dian (宋典) and Bi Lan (畢嵐) with {{overseeing}} {{new construction}} projects, {{including a new}} palace hall, four large bronze statues, four giant bronze bells and <b>water-spouting</b> animal sculptures, among others. He also ordered coins to be minted and widely circulated. Many people perceived {{this to be a}} display of the emperor's extravagance, and pointed to signs showing that the coins will eventually scatter everywhere. This turned out to be true when chaos broke out in Luoyang after Emperor Ling's death. Emperor Ling appointed Zhao Zhong as [...] "General of Chariots of Cavalry" [...] (車騎將軍) but removed him from office after some 100 days.|$|R
60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that waterspouts are to a great extent, if not altogether, due to the {{presence}} of electricity in the air. When the clouds have been raging for some time in the skies of tropical regions, rendering the darkness bright, and the air tremulous with their dread artillery, they seem to grow unusually thirsty; the ordinary means of water-supply through the atmosphere {{do not appear to be}} sufficient for the demand, or war-tax in the shape of <b>water-spouts,</b> that is levied on nature. The clouds therefore descend to the sea, and, putting down their dark tongues, lick up the water thirstily in the form of waterspouts.|$|R
6000|$|So saying, I {{advanced}} to the window. The view was not interesting. It consisted {{of the side of}} a house; about three feet distant, down which ran a <b>water-spout,</b> or drain-pipe, which slightly relieved the dead look of the bricks. From one pane of the window it was possible, by squeezing your cheek against it, to obtain a perspective view of chimney-pots. By a stretch of the neck upwards you could see more chimney pots. By a stretch of imagination you could see cats quarrelling around them,--or anything else you pleased! ...|$|E
60|$|So {{things went}} on at Plumstead, {{and on the}} whole not unpleasantly, till a huge storm darkened the horizon and came down upon the {{inhabitants}} of the rectory with all the fury of a <b>water-spout.</b> It was astonishing how in a few minutes the whole face of the heavens was changed. The party broke up from breakfast in perfect harmony, but fierce passions had arisen before the evening which did not admit of their sitting at the same board for dinner. To explain this {{it will be necessary to}} go back a little.|$|E
60|$|Mr Carker {{bowed his}} head, and {{rising from the}} table, and {{standing}} thoughtfully before the fire, with {{his hand to his}} smooth chin, looked down at Mr Dombey with the evil slyness of some monkish carving, half human and half brute; or like a leering face on an old <b>water-spout.</b> Mr Dombey, recovering his composure by degrees, or cooling his emotion in his sense of having taken a high position, sat gradually stiffening again, and looking at the parrot as she swung to and fro, in her great wedding ring.|$|E
5000|$|Xie and Wei {{created a}} similar device {{operated}} by wheel motion called the field mill, although it served {{a more practical}} purpose than the theatrical display of moving statues and <b>water-spouting</b> dragons. The Yezhongji states that the two devised a [...] "pounding cart" [...] or [...] "pounding wagon" [...] which had figurine statues armed with real tilt hammers who pounded and hulled rice only when the cart moved. In addition to this they had a [...] "mill cart" [...] (field mill or camp mill) which had rotating millstones mounted on their frames, which would rotate and grind wheat as the cart moved forward. Just like the carriage with mechanical figures mentioned above, when the carriage stopped, the devices associated with them halted.|$|R
50|$|Adapting the {{tradition}} of “river god” sculpture, Calder created large Native American figures to symbolize the area's major streams, the Delaware, the Schuylkill, and the Wissahickon. The young girl leaning on her side against an agitated, <b>water-spouting</b> swan represents the Wissahickon Creek; the mature woman holding the neck of a swan stands for the Schuylkill River; and the male figure, reaching above his head to grasp his bow as a large pike sprays water over him, symbolizes the Delaware River. Sculpted frogs and turtles spout water toward the 50-foot (15 m) geyser in the center, though typically the geyser only spouts 25 ft (8 m). The use of swans is a pun on Dr. Swann's name. Eyre designed the basin and the interlacing water jets, including the central geyser.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} few minutes, the tables turned in favour of the British when the battlecruiser [...] closed the {{distance}} on the Italian cruisers, and straddled Trieste with two salvoes. The Italian cruiser was hit by splinters. [...] This advantage was soon negated, however, when at 13:00, Vittorio Veneto opened fire from 27000 m. Vittorio Veneto fired 19 rounds in seven salvoes from long range {{and that was enough}} for the now outgunned British cruisers, which turned back at the fourth salvo. In fact, as giant <b>water-spouts</b> erupted around Berwick and Manchester, Holland ordered smoke, and his ships fled southeast to close with Renown. Manchester was holed by splinters from Vittorio Venetos rounds. Both forces withdrew, the battle lasting a total of 54 minutes and causing little damage to either side.|$|R
