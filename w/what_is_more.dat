5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} of partial {{differential}} equations. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential equations.|$|E

The {{powerhouse}} of Swedish football in recent years, Malmö FF also saw glory in the 1970s, winning five Swedish championships and four Svenska Cupen titles. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> MFF {{is the only}} Northern European club to have reached {{the final of the}} European Cup, the predecessor of the UEFA Champions League. They were runners-up in the 1979 European Champions Cup final, which they lost 1–0 to English club Nottingham Forest. For this feat, Malmö FF were awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal. Malmö FF are the leaders of the overall Allsvenskan table maratontabellen. In more recent history the team qualified for two consecutive group stages of the Champions League in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{that tried to}} explain how prions replicate in a protein-only manner was the heterodimer model. This model assumed that a single PrPSc molecule binds to a single PrPC molecule and catalyzes its conversion into PrPSc. The two PrPSc molecules then come apart and can go on to convert more PrPC. However, a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate, and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare. Manfred Eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires PrPSc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing {{the rate of the}} conversion reaction by a factor of around 1015. This problem does not arise if PrPSc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrPSc has never been isolated.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E

While he does not give the Christian name of this midshipman Lockhart, James was in fact eighteen years old when this was written. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> his career at sea would help account for his presence some months later in Persia, since the trip overland from Scotland to Persia was exceedingly arduous in 1746.|$|E
25|$|Budd {{continued}} to build gallery passenger cars for Chicago-area commuter {{service on the}} Burlington Route (and Burlington Northern after the merger), Rock Island, and Milwaukee Road lines during the 1960s and 1970s; most of these cars are still in service on today's Metra routes. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> the Santa Fe Hi-level cars were {{the inspiration for the}} Amtrak Superliner and Superliner II which ply the rails of Amtrak on many different routes even today, though they were not a product of Budd.|$|E
25|$|Some {{additional}} {{support for this}} hypothesis comes from the ancient Near Eastern literary materials. For example, the Akkadian plates mention the name shuwalu or suwala in reference to a deity responsible for ruling the abode of the dead. As such {{it might have been}} borrowed by the Hebrews and incorporated into their early belief system. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> some scholars argue that Sheol understood anthropomorphically fits the semantic complex of the other ancient Near Eastern death deities such as Nergal, Ereshkigal or Mot.|$|E

25|$|As for the Chinese, I {{have the}} highest opinion {{not only of the}} Chinese character, but of the Chinese fitness for self-government. I think they are eminently fitted to make a {{republic}} successful. China, for instance, is infinitely better fitted than is Russia for development along republican lines. In fact, China has always been practically a republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, but the political unit of China has always been the village. The village people have always had their influence upon the Government. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> the average Chinaman is intelligent.|$|E

In April, when the queen {{normally}} lays her eggs, the workers actively go out and forage. However, typically around the fall season, a change is observed in the colony as the foraging workers turn into scavengers. Instead of putting forth the effort to find food sources, the workers try to take <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> easily available. For example, European hornets have been seen hovering around garbage cans and picnic areas in the fall.|$|E

25|$|For GSK3 to be {{a highly}} {{effective}} kinase on a substrate, pre-phosphorylation is not enough. There is one additional requirement: Similar to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), substrates need to associate with this enzyme through high-affinity docking motifs. Beta-catenin contains no such motifs, but a special protein does: axin. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> its GSK3 docking motif is directly adjacent to a β-catenin binding motif. This way, axin acts as a true scaffold protein, bringing an enzyme (GSK3) together with its substrate (β-catenin) into close physical proximity.|$|E
25|$|The {{recombinant}} {{building is}} a lesson in engineering and architecture. Thirty thousand square feet of studios and seminar spaces, a workshop, a thesis pit and a bridge to the library have been stacked, cantilevered and suspended to form an open-ended, permissive, flexible space. It seems that anything can happen within these walls. Enter a studio through its doorway (which has no door), and you are standing on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> like a stage, looking out through a proscenium framed by new steel posts and girders set parallel to and {{in tandem with the}} old concrete columns and beams.|$|E

25|$|Eddie Keher of the Rower-Inistioge holds {{numerous}} championship scoring records. In 50 championship appearances between 1959 and 1977 {{he scored}} 35 goals and 334 points. Not only that but Keher also set and broke {{a number of}} individual records. In the 1963 All-Ireland final he scored 14 points, a verifiable record for a final up to that point. In 1971 Keher broke his own record when he captured 2 goals and 11 points in the All-Ireland final against Tipperary. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> remarkable {{is the fact that}} he ended up on the losing side on that occasion. This record was broken by Nicky English in 1989 when he scored 2 goals and 12 points in a 70-minute All-Ireland final. Keher's tally of 6 goals and 45 points in the 1972 championship is also a record.|$|E

If Government is of people and democratic, people can be consulted, as we are doing here. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> an example of pure democracy than meetings such as this one. If they cannot call such meetings they are not democracies.” Castro continued “Those who want to see people’s democracy let them come here and see this. We can speak to America and the world because we speak in names of a whole nation.” In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American liberal democracies, describing them as a “Pretense of democracy”, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings.|$|E
