He would further manually optimize propellers for air racers in the field {{with the aid of}} a <b>wood</b> <b>rasp</b> which he used to remove material from the propeller. One of his customers was Rudy Kling, an airplane racer, whose Folkerts Special won the Thompson Trophy in Cleveland, Ohio, using one of Fahlin's propeller designs.|$|E

Similarly bagworms cut and shape thorns or twigs to form their case. Some sphecid wasps collect mud and blend them with water to construct free standing nests of mud. Paper wasp queens build with paper pulp which they prepare by <b>rasping</b> <b>wood</b> with their jaws and mixing with saliva, a case of collecting, processing and blending raw materials.|$|R
