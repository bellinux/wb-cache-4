5|$|Mitra had met Ray {{on the set}} of The River, where Mitra {{was allowed}} to observe the production, take {{photographs}} and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed his photographs. Ray was impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant's position on Pather Panchali, and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that Ray was nervous about <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> established crew.|$|E

From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{publishers}} of erotic romance are either small press publishers or electronic book publishers. Writers often have more leeway {{as to what}} types of erotic acts can be included when <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> electronic publisher {{than they would have}} when working with a print publisher. The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books. Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance.

500|$|Madhavan {{was cast}} {{alongside}} Kamal Haasan in Anbe Sivam (2003), which {{told the story}} of an unexpected journey from Bhubaneswar to Chennai of two men who are polar opposites. Madhavan revealed his elation at <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> experienced actor like Kamal Haasan, while noting that a human drama film like Anbe Sivam was important for his career as an actor as it came after a successful masala film in Run. Portraying a young frustrated filmmaker with capitalist beliefs who travels with a handicapped communist played by Kamal Haasan, Madhavan's performance was described as a [...] "milestone in his career" [...] and that [...] "his portrayal will remain with the viewer for long" [...] by a critic from The Hindu. The film opened in January 2003 to positive reviews, but became a surprise box-office failure. Post-release, the film has garnered belated critical acclaim from critics and television audiences and is considered as one of the [...] "cult classics" [...] of Tamil cinema. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote that the film [...] "was leagues ahead of the average Tamil and Indian film", though felt that [...] "the masses were unwilling to accept the experimental nature of the film", while talking about the film's box office failure. Post-filming, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was impressed with Madhavan's enthusiasm and concentration during the making of the film and thus subsequently signed him on to appear in his production venture, Nala Damayanthi (2003), where he played a Brahmin cook lost in Australia. In 2003, the actor also appeared in Vikraman's family drama Priyamana Thozhi as a budding cricketer, Saran's romantic comedy Jay Jay and made a guest appearance in Priyadarshan's Lesa Lesa as a jailed teacher. The three films made average returns at the box office, though Madhavan's performances were appreciated by critics.|$|E
