5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E

5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} {{to be associated with the}} Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Around 1450 the Chajoma, led {{by their}} king Lajuj No'j, moved to Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) from Ochal {{to make their}} capital more {{inaccessible}} to their hostile neighbours. In spite of this, Iximche defeated the Chajoma and Jilotepeque Viejo became subject to the Kaqchikel kingdom. Groups C and E show Kaqchikel influence in their architectural styles, while groups A and B have a purer Chajoma architectural style. Both ballcourts {{appear to have been}} remodelled after the Kaqchikel fashion, <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> coatings of stucco.|$|E

5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or almond milk (for a kosher version) and cornstarch. It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E
5|$|Residential {{buildings}} {{are limited to}} four stories above street level and if possible another four stories below, according to the Greater Amman Municipality regulations. The {{buildings are}} covered <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> white limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each floor, {{with the exception of}} the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or on the roof of covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, plastic or glass.|$|E
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E

5|$|Shakshouka, {{originally}} a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically {{served in the}} same frying pan {{in which it is}} cooked, <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> slices of white bread to mop up the sauce, and a side of salad. Modern variations include a milder version made with spinach and feta without tomato sauce, and hot chili shakshouka, a version that includes both sweet and hot peppers and coriander.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age in Scotland {{lasted from}} {{approximately}} 2000 BC to 800 BC. The oldest known {{remains on the}} Jarlshof site date from this period, although {{there is evidence of}} inhabitation as far back as 2500 BC. The remains of several small oval houses <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> stone walls date to the late Bronze Age and the structures show some similarity to Skara Brae on Mainland, Orkney, but are smaller and of a later date. These buildings may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.|$|E
5|$|The Presidio {{was built}} to {{standard}} plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed <b>with</b> <b>thick,</b> solid adobe outer walls. The main gate opened into an open parade ground/plaza {{in the center of}} the square. The chapel stood at the center of the back of the square, facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.|$|E

5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although not so much as in heavy draft breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} {{has occurred in}} parts of Iran since the Cretaceous period. During the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, volcanic activity reached its maximum, <b>with</b> <b>thick</b> pyroclastic layers being deposited in central Iran and the Alborz mountains. The area around Taftan volcano belongs to a tectonic zone which is variously {{referred to as the}} Sistan suture or the Zabul-Baloch zone. There, after a previous episode of rifting and subsequent formation of an ocean, the Neh and Lut tectonic blocks collided during the Eocene epoch after a subduction episode that commenced in the Maastrichtian age.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated <b>with</b> <b>thick,</b> steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
