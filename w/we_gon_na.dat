There were also some lyrics alluding to former N.W.A rapper Ice Cube, who departed acrimoniously from the group in 1989 and ridiculed Dre on the track [...] "No Vaseline", off his 1991 Death Certificate album. The lyrics: [...] "Then <b>we</b> <b>gon</b> creep to South Central, On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple, Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap, Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat, You tryin to check my homey, you best check yo self, Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself" [...] had references to Cube's production operation Street Knowledge Productions (now Lench Mob Records), the lyrics [...] "steps in the temple" [...] referring to Ice Cube's affiliation with the Nation of Islam and his hit single [...] "Check Yo Self" [...] from third album The Predator. However, by the album's release, Ice Cube was on friendlier terms with Dr. Dre, even having a cameo appearance in [...] "Let Me Ride", so unlike Eazy-E and Luke, he was not parodied in the music video.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe yeast KEOPS protein complex {{comprising}} Kae 1, Bud 32, Cgi 121, Pcc 1 and Gon 7 {{is responsible}} for the essential tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t(6) A) modification. Deletion of genes coding for the KEOPS subunits also affects telomere elongation and transcriptional regulation. In the present work, the crystal structure of Bud 32 /Cgi 121 in complex with ADP revealed that ADP is bound in the catalytic site of Bud 32 in a canonical manner characteristic of Protein Kinase A (PKA) family proteins. <b>We</b> found that <b>Gon</b> 7 forms a stable heterodimer with Pcc 1 and report the crystal structure of the Pcc 1 -Gon 7 heterodimer. Gon 7 interacts with the same Pcc 1 region engaged in the archaeal Pcc 1 homodimer. We further show that yeast KEOPS, unlike its archaeal counterpart, exists as a heteropentamer in which Gon 7, Pcc 1, Kae 1, Bud 32 and Cgi 121 also adopt a linear arrangement. We constructed a model of yeast KEOPS that provides structural insight into the role of Gon 7. The model also revealed the presence of a highly positively charged crater surrounding the entrance of Kae 1 that likely binds tRNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{recommendation}} by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that erythromycin and tetra-cycline ointments, {{as well as}} topical {{silver nitrate}} solution, are acceptable regimens for prophylaxis of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum (GON) has resulted in widespread local review of policies for ocular prophylaxis. The data concerning the efficacy and side effects of these agents are somewhat confusing or nonexistent. We discuss the etiologies of neonatal conjunctivitis and the topical and systemic agents used for prophylaxis of <b>GON.</b> <b>We</b> also review all studies that have compared the efficacy of one prophylactic agent with that of another agent or with no prophylaxis. It is found that all three agents have similar efficacy in preventing GON, although silver nitrate has been used more extensively in populations {{at high risk for}} GON. However, since Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common infectious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis in the United States at this time, and erythromycin appears to be very effective in prevention of neonatal conjunctivitis due to C. trachomatis, it may have an advantage over the other two agents. In addition, eryth-romycin use is associated with fewer ocular reactions than is silver nitrate. IN MOST of the United States, prophylaxis of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum (GON) is re...|$|R
40|$|B {{lymphopoiesis}} {{requires a}} network of transcription factors that orchestrate changes in gene expression amidst immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and periods of cell proliferation. Although proteins required for the function of this network have been identified, the precise mechanisms that coordinate these processes as hematopoietic progenitors differentiate into lineage-committed B cells remain unclear. Justy mice display a profound arrest of B cell development {{at the time of}} lineage commitment due to a point mutation that decreases expression of the protein Gon 4 -like. Previous studies suggested that Gon 4 -like functions to coordinate gene expression and cell division to determine cell fate, but the role of Gon 4 -like in B lymphopoiesis is largely unknown. Here <b>we</b> demonstrate that <b>Gon</b> 4 -like is required to regulate gene expression and cell cycle progression in B cell progenitors. Expression of genes required for B cell development is intact in Justy B cell progenitors, yet these cells fail to repress genes that promote the development of alternative lineages. In addition, Justy B cell progenitors are unable to upregulate genes that instruct cell cycle progression. Consistent with this, B cell progenitors from Justy mice show signs of impaired proliferation and undergo apoptosis despite containing elevated levels of activated STAT 5, a transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation and survival. Genetic ablation of p 53 or retroviral-mediated overexpression of pro-survival factors failed to rescue these defects. In contrast, overexpression of proteins that promote the G 1 /S transition of the cell cycle, including D-type cyclins, E 2 F 2 and cyclin E, rescued pro-B cell development from Justy progenitors, an effect that was not observed upon overexpression of proteins that function during the S and G 2 M phases of the cell cycle. Further, overexpression of cyclin D 3 led to partial restoration of gene repression in Justy pro-B cells. Notably, Gon 4 -like interacted with STAT 5 when overexpressed in transformed cells, suggesting Gon 4 -like and STAT 5 function together to activate expression of STAT 5 target genes. Collectively, our data indicate that Gon 4 -like is required to coordinate gene repression and cell cycle progression during B lymphopoiesis...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{entities}} to which differential diagnosis {{need to be}} considered. EF, a recently described novel headache syndrome, is characterized by brief pain paroxysms starting {{in a particular area}} of the posterior scalp, and rapidly radiating forwards along a linear trajectory to reach the ipsilateral forehead, eye, or nose in a few seconds (Pareja et al. 2008; Guerrero et al. 2010; Cuadrado et al. 2013). The linear pain trajectory in EF is similar to that in LH, but LH is dramatically different from the ultrashort duration (less than 10  s) of moving stabbing or electric pain in EF patient. On the other hand, LH may be associated with EF. Pareja and Bandrés recently reported a patient with long-lasting linear interictal pain between the attacks of EF, and this interictal pain is similar to the LH pain (Pareja and Bandres, 2015). Wang et al. have proposed that this linear interictal pain may be LH triggered by EF (Wang et al. 2015), as EF can trigger the attacks of migraine and cluster headache (Jin and Wang, 2013), and LH has many clinical features similar to that of migraine (Wang et al. 2014 b). Moreover, the LH pain area is correspondent to the scalp area innervated by the supraorbital nerve (SON) and the greater occipital nerve (<b>GON),</b> <b>we</b> need to differentiate LH from trigeminal (TN) and occipital neuralgia (ON) and some trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) such as paroxysmal hemicrania (PH). But the much loner pain duration, the accompaniments of dizziness, and nausea, the triggering factors of noise, bright night, resting after physical activity and menstruation in LH makes it obviously different from TN and ON. PH is typically characterized by repeated attacks of severe, strictly unilateral pain lasting 2 – 30  min, localized to orbital, supraorbital, and temporal areas accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic features of conjunctival, nasal, facial and eyelid symptoms or signs. But some atypical PH patients do not have accompaniment of autonomic symptoms and the pain duration may extend to hours (Boes and Dodick 2002; Maggioni 2010; Prakash et al. 2013). This atypical episodic or chronic PH may have some LH-like features, but the LH pain striding the trigeminal and occopital nerve innervating areas is obviously different from the PH pain localized to orbital, supraorbital, and temporal areas or in any combination of these sites. These PH pain sites are innervated by trigeminal nerve only, as PH is a type of trigeminal cephalalgia. Thus, LH is different from PH in headache classification.|$|R
