5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost {{a decade and a half}} after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution).

5|$|On November 18, 2010, Dunderdale and Premier Williams {{were joined}} by Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter in announcing a $6.2billion {{agreement}} to develop {{the first phase of}} the Lower Churchill Project. Nalcor Energy, a Newfoundland and Labrador Crown corporation, signed a partnership agreement with Emera Inc. of Nova Scotia to develop the 824megawatts Muskrat Falls. The hydro development would see power from the falls transferred from Labrador to the island of Newfoundland via an underwater transmission link through the Strait of Belle Isle. Another underwater transmission link across the Gulf of St. Lawrence would bring power to Nova Scotia. Newfoundland and Labrador will use 40 percent of the hydro power itself and will be able to shut down the oil-burning Holyrood Thermal Generating Station. Emera Inc. will get 20% of the power for $1.2billion to sell to customers in Nova Scotia. The remaining 40 percent <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> by Nalcor Energy to markets in Atlantic Canada and the Northeastern United States.|$|E
