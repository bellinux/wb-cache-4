5|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), create and produce versions of Sesame Street in those countries. Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers were available to protect the barrage, the drifters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be withdrawn at night. The drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{hotly contested}} status of O'Shaughnessy Dam in the {{environmental}} field, and occasional federal money set aside for studying alternatives to Hetch Hetchy – such as $7 million provided by President George W. Bush in 2007 in the National Park Service budget – local support for its removal is relatively low. In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace Hetch Hetchy water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new water delivery and filtration systems <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be in place by 2025 and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be drained by 2035.|$|E

5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British {{during the early years}} of the conflict; thus Window <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E
25|$|According to Deutsche Bahn, {{the already}} built {{structures}} {{have already been}} included in the regular maintenance program in order to ensure their functionality {{at the opening of the}} line. Early operations on the section between Erfurt and Ilmenau and further modifications of the project were proposed. Deutsche Bahn rejected early operations on the line. On the one hand, such regional services had not been ordered by the State of Thuringia; on the other hand, the safety and control technology that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be installed <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become obsolete when the entire line was opened and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be replaced.

5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E

5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed-fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated.

For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended {{on the type of}} crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E

5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E
