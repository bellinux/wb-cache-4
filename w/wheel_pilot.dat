50|$|A similar carnival-style wheel {{was used}} in the {{original}} 1973 <b>Wheel</b> <b>pilot</b> (Shopper's Bazaar), although that wheel was operated by a motor. A further (and far more explicit) connection arrived in 1981, when Grundy debuted his adaptation of Griffin's Wheel which (like its American counterpart) also had a very long and successful run on the Seven Network until 2006.|$|E
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{supplied by}} Timken or SKF were {{used on the}} four <b>wheel</b> <b>pilot</b> and trailing trucks {{as well as the}} six wheel tender trucks. The first 20 examples, (2100-2119) used friction bearings on the eight driving wheels, while the final 10 (2120-2129), intended for both freight and passenger service, had roller bearings throughout. The driving wheels themselves used the Boxpok design with a diameter of 70 in.|$|E
50|$|Terranova {{retired from}} his first two {{attempts}} at the Dakar Rally in 2005 and 2007, both times aboard a KTM, and when the event resumed in 2009 in South America following the cancellation of the 2008 event, he opted to switch to four <b>wheels.</b> <b>Piloting</b> a X-Raid prepared BMW X3 alongside co-driver Alain Guehennec, Terranova once again failed to finish, although he did win that year's Tunisian Rally. He completed the Dakar {{for the first time}} the following year, this time alongside Pascal Maimon, finishing ninth overall in a Mitsubishi Racing Lancer.|$|R

2500|$|Sensing {{the time}} was right to escape, Cunningham did not reply to Parker's request. To keep the mutineers from suspecting his plan, Cunningham kept the sails of the Clyde down and did not man the ship's <b>wheel</b> with a <b>pilot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Mississippi River style {{steamboat}} Belle of Louisville, (originally Idlewild and oldest in her class), is {{fitted with}} a steering engine. Original equipment when the boat was launched at Pittsburgh in 1915, the engine consists of a single double-acting steam cylinder mounted aft of and above the engines, coupled to the rudders, with the motion of travel abeam. The steam valves of the engine are controlled by mechanical linkages which extend up to levers mounted {{either side of the}} engine order telegraph, just aft of the <b>pilot</b> <b>wheel</b> in the <b>pilot</b> house above. The steering engine is open to public view. A functional description is given in the 1965 book Str. Belle of Louisville, by Alan L. Bates, the marine architect who supervised the restoration of the boat, who comments that when in use, the steering engine causes the <b>pilot</b> <b>wheel</b> to whirl [...] "as fast as an electric fan." [...] The same source also describes the functional need for steering hard-to in vessels of its type, whose combination of shallow draft and high above-water profile require rapid changes in rudder under shifting wind conditions, a need which is addressed by the steering engine.|$|R
50|$|The glider was {{designated}} the D.1-A. Its undercarriage {{consisted of a}} pair of skids underneath the lower wing. Takeoff was achieved by launching the glider from a <b>wheeled</b> platform. The <b>pilot's</b> seat was placed centrally at the front, between the upper and lower planes.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the fair}} (also called The Chicago World's Fair), he became acquainted with No. 638, a big new freight engine IC had on display {{as the latest}} and {{greatest}} technological advancement in trains. It had eight drive <b>wheels</b> and two <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels,</b> a 2-8-0 [...] "Consolidation" [...] type. At {{the closing of the}} fair, No. 638 was due to be sent to Water Valley for service in the Jackson District. Jones asked for permission to drive the engine back to Water Valley. His request was approved, and No. 638 ran its first [...] with Jones at the throttle to Water Valley. Jones liked No. 638 and liked working in the Jackson District because his family was there. They had once moved to Water Valley, but returned to Jackson, which they felt was home.|$|R

5000|$|Freiberger, {{a design}} {{engineer}} at General Motors and Rose-Hulman graduate flew Ron's 1 in November 1971, {{it was a}} braced low-wing monoplane with a welded steel-tube fuselage covered with Ceconite. The two-spar wing had vee-bracing struts and was made of wood with a Ceconite covering. Ron's 1 had a fixed tailwheel type landing gear with fairings over the main <b>wheels,</b> the <b>pilot</b> and passenger sat in tandem open cockpits. Powered by a [...] Lycoming O-320-B1B flat-four air-cooled engine driving a two-bladed metal fixed pitch propeller, Freiberger enclosed the engine in a radial-style cowling to give the aircraft a look of the early 1930s racing aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|After being retired, the {{locomotive}} {{was sold to}} the Edaville Railroad in September 1961, and then became part of Steamtown in 1969. [...] It has been cannibalized for parts for Steamtown's operating Canadian National 2-8-2, the 3254. Even the <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels</b> and trailing truck were removed, making it an oversized 0-8-0. [...] The locomotive sits on display south of the Steamtown shops.|$|R
5000|$|The {{leading wheel}} or leading axle or <b>pilot</b> <b>wheel</b> of a steam {{locomotive}} is an unpowered wheel or axle located {{in front of}} the driving wheels. The axle or axles of the leading wheels are normally located on a leading truck. Leading wheels are used to help the locomotive negotiate curves and to support the front portion of the boiler.|$|R

2500|$|The Axio GT is {{a version}} based on Corolla Axio {{based on the}} Axio N2 race car. It {{includes}} turbocharged 1NZ-FE engine rated [...] and , intercooler, 5-speed manual transmission, TRD Sportivo suspension, 'GT' emblem, leather shift knob, 'TRD Turbo' aero grill, front spoiler, side mud guard, TF4 17-inch <b>wheels</b> with Michelin <b>Pilot</b> Preceda PP2 215/45R17 tires, rear spoiler, drive monitor, grey interior, enhanced clutch cover. The vehicle went on sale in February 2009 in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The car's {{appearance}} is also changed, using a bodykit {{that includes a}} polyurethane front air dam and carbon fibre doors, mirrors, engine lid, and spoiler, all of which reduce the car's weight to 2932 lb. The car is fitted with 19 inch Ruf-designed Superleggera <b>wheels</b> and Michelin <b>Pilot</b> Sport Cup tires. Finally, the RGT is customized with interior trim of the customer's choice, including Recaro seats and the deletion of unnecessary parts to save weight.|$|R
50|$|With the Federal Highway Act of 1954, Congress {{responded to}} the {{recommendations}} of BPR by appropriating planning funds. BPR was authorized to work {{with each of the}} states to develop specific criteria for the parkway and to determine one specific route within each state for the Mississippi River Parkway. By the late 1950s, the familiar green-and-white <b>pilot's</b> <b>wheel</b> marker began to spring up on various sections of the designated route. Planning continued through the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|After the Olympic {{games in}} Berlin in 1936 {{introduced}} gliding as an Olympic sport, plans {{were made to}} fly the 1940 Olympic championships with a standard design of sailplane to give each pilot the same chances. As a result of this, the Meise was redesigned {{to fit into the}} new Olympic class specifications. The new 'Olympia' Meise had the prescribed wingspan of 15 m (49 ft 2 in), spoilers, but no flaps, and an undercarriage consisting of a skid and a non-retractable <b>wheel.</b> The <b>pilot</b> sat all-enclosed in an aerodynamically clean fuselage made of laminated wood and topped by an acrylic glass hood. The plane could be launched by winch as well by airplane. Its wood-and-fabric construction made it easy for flying clubs to maintain, to repair and even to build the gliders from kits.|$|R

At center, Glenn Curtis is seen gripping a round steering <b>wheel</b> and <b>piloting</b> {{a simple}} biplane. To the right, Jerome Fancuilli {{sits on the}} frame of the plane as it moves through the air. The plane is composed of two parallel, flat wings. Additionally, two sets of flaps can be seen on the edge of each wing. Below {{the frame of the}} plane, two wheels are visible and one wheel extends far from the structure. Several rods and other support can be seen holding the wings and frame in place. Below the plane in the foreground, several lightly-colored tents and a banner are visible. In the background, trees and houses dot the horizon...|$|R
5000|$|The pilot {{house was}} a cupola like box, with glass-paned windows on all four sides, that perched on the {{hurricane}} deck. From this vantage point the river pilot (who has often the captain, in a smaller steamship like the [...] "Far West") guided the boat, while also regulating the power applied to the paddle <b>wheel.</b> The <b>pilot</b> guided the boat using a large spoked wheel, which was connected {{by a series of}} ropes or chains to the rudders {{at the rear of the}} boat. The pilot also regulated the power applied to the stern paddle wheel, using a voice tube to talk to the engineer, telling him when and in what amount to provide steam to power the stern wheel, and when to stop or reverse the paddle wheel.|$|R
50|$|Railroad maintenance. Railroad {{equipment}} is very heavy, {{and the track}} needs maintenance it's whole length, no matter how remote. The WorkStar's chassis can be ordered to mount road-rail <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels,</b> which let the truck run directly on the tracks. Racks can be mounted outside and above the cab so the truck can self-load and unload sections of rail onto them. The crew-cab is often used, and the truck also carries {{a large amount of}} tools and equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} likely used for both freight and {{passenger}} service for the Western and Atlantic. The Yonah {{was an example of}} an early 4-4-0 design, featuring a Haycock firebox design and having its <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels</b> closely spaced with the cylinder placed above at an angle. Thus, the engine was likely relegated to yard service as early as the late 1850s, as the railroad had acquired larger, more powerful locomotives such as the General and the Texas.|$|R
50|$|The {{sailplane}} is {{trimmed in}} pitch via an innovative variable-position horizontal stabilizer. The stabilizer position {{is governed by}} the flaperon setting. The five settings of the flaperons control produce corresponding changes to the stabilizer incidence, thus defining the trim airspeed {{in relation to the}} flaperons requirements. The conventional elevator remains in trail, minimizing trim drag. There is a fixed or retractable main <b>wheel</b> behind the <b>pilot,</b> with shock absorber and drum brake activated via spoiler control lever aft travel.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the analysis}} of separate surface automatic flight control systems. The feasibility of such systems is demonstrated by the analysis of an example system, a separate surface wing-leveler for a Cessna 172. This example system employs a separate surface aileron with 15 % of the basic airplane roll control power. A 90 % reduction in bank-angle gust response can be obtained when compared with the basic airplane. The system does not feed back to the <b>pilot's</b> <b>wheel.</b> When failed (even hardover) the pilot retains more than adequate control of the airplane...|$|R

The standard engine provided was the Kawasaki TA 440A snowmobile powerplant of [...]|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was damaged}} in landing on 10 July 1947. The aircraft was undergoing maximum landing weight tests. During one particularly hard landing, the right main gear was severed at the engine nacelle. The aircraft bounced hard, and staggered {{back into the}} air. The test pilot was able to maintain control, and climb to a safe altitude. He continued to fly the aircraft to burn off excess fuel, to both make the aircraft lighter and lessen the chance of fire. Once excess fuel was burned off, the pilot landed on the left main gear and the nose <b>wheel.</b> The <b>pilot</b> touched down, and while keeping the right wing up, scrubbed off as much speed as possible before it touched down. During the incident the aircraft suffered significant damage. The right wing spar was cracked, and the #3 and #4 engines and props needed to be replaced due to the ground contact. The aircraft was repaired by Republic, and later returned to service.|$|R
