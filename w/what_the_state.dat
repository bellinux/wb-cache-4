25|$|The Copenhagen {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying determinism and realism. According to the Copenhagen {{interpretation of}} quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the quantum state describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There {{is no way to}} say <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.|$|E
25|$|Equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} is {{the systematic}} study of transformations of matter and energy in systems as they approach equilibrium. The word equilibrium implies a state of balance. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces, within the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial state, subject to accurately specified constraints, to calculate <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the system will be once it has reached equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|Until the 11th century, the {{majority}} of the conscripts were from rural areas, while the conscription of craftsmen and merchants is still an open question. From then on, professional recruiting replaced conscription, and the increasing use of mercenaries in the army was ruinous for the treasury. From the 10th century onwards, there were laws connecting land ownership and military service. While the state never allotted land for obligatory service, soldiers could and did use their pay to buy landed estates, and taxes would be decreased or waived in some cases. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> did allocate to soldiers, however, from the 12th century onwards, were the tax revenues from some estates called pronoiai (...)

500|$|The eponymous {{group which}} [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] centers around was written {{as a general}} parody of boy bands, and not with any {{particular}} group in mind. Bouchard explained that the choice of using a non-specific type of parody was not brought about by fears that the episode would become dated, but rather because the staff all had different boy bands that [...] "made them chuckle." [...] He did, however, specifically research the English-Irish boy band One Direction for the episode because he [...] "wanted to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the art was" [...] and [...] "hadn't been that interested in Boyz II Men or Backstreet Boys or 'N Sync."

500|$|The {{passing of}} the law was met with major {{international}} backlash, especially from the Western world, as critics considered it an attempt to effectively ban the promotion of LGBT rights and culture in the country. Article 19 disputed the claimed intent of the law, and felt {{that many of the}} terms used within were too ambiguous, such as the aforementioned [...] "non-traditional sexual relationships", and [...] "raises interest in". The organization argued that it [...] "feasibly could apply to any information regarding sexual orientation or gender identity that does not fit with <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> considers as in-line with 'tradition'." [...] The use of the term [...] "among minors" [...] was also criticized, as it was unclear whether it refers to being in the presence of minors, or any place where minors could be present, arguing that [...] "predicting the presence of children in any space, on-line or off-line, is quite impossible and is a variable that the proponent of any expression will rarely be in absolute control of." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1944, the Soviets also {{invited a}} group {{of more than a}} dozen mostly American and British journalists, {{accompanied}} by Kathleen Harriman, the daughter of the new American ambassador W. Averell Harriman, and John F. Melby, third secretary at the American embassy in Moscow, to Katyn. The inclusion of Melby and Harriman was regarded by some at the time as a Soviet attempt to lend official weight to their propaganda. Melby's report noted the deficiencies in the Soviet case: problematic witnesses; attempts to discourage questioning of the witnesses; statements of the witnesses obviously being given as a result of rote memorization; and that [...] "the show was put on for the benefit of the correspondents". Nevertheless, Melby, at the time, felt that on balance the Russian case was convincing. Harriman's report reached the same conclusion and after the war both were asked to explain why their conclusions seemed to be at odds with their findings, with the suspicion that the conclusions were <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Department wanted to hear. The journalists were less impressed and not totally convinced by the staged Soviet demonstration.|$|E

He failed to get voter support for the $50million in necessary highway improvements. Although the Socialist Party was no longer a political threat, it advocated strikes. In 1919, telephone workers struck in Drumright, Oklahoma, and a massive strike of coal miners took place in eastern Oklahoma. Governor Robertson, in his position as Commander-in-Chief, declared martial law in these regions. The Bank Guaranty Program, which Governor Haskell had instituted, collapsed following Oklahoma’s recession in 1920, resulting in the closure of many state banks.|$|E
