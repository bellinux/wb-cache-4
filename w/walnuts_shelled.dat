This paper evaluates the aqueous NOMs adsorption efficiency on <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> modified with Zinc Oxide (ZnO). Materials &amp; Methods: This study examined the feasibility of removing NOMs from aqueous solutions using <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> modified with ZnO. The effects of NOMs concentration, modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO dosage, and pH on adsorption of NOMs by modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO were evaluated. Results: The adsorption capacities of modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO in the best conditions were 37. 93 mg/g. The results also demonstrated that adsorption capacity of NOMs on modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO was higher in lower pHs due to significantly high electrostatic attraction exists between the positively charged surface of the adsorbent and negatively charged NOMs. And finally adsorption capacity decreases as adsorbent dose increase.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study promise a {{sustainable}} process for making an alternative fuel from <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> which is an agricultural waste. Gasification of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> in SCW media was performed under 13 different conditions to observe the effect of parameters including temperature, feed content and reaction time on the yields of main gaseous products considering the main reactions of the process. Promising results were obtained using holistic and comprehensive analysis of gaseous products and affecting parameters, for waste management sector and energy industry of Iran which has not been studied before. Ranges of variation of parameters were determined, considering the capacity of the reactor system and the obtained results from the literature. The temperature had a significant effect on the total gas and hydrogen yield so that as temperature increased, hydrogen yield increased while increasing the temperature may cause intensive energy consumption. So, the appropriate range of temperature was considered between 400 and 440  °C and the maximum hydrogen yield occurred in 440  °C. The effects of reaction time and <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> loading were investigated at this temperature. The maximum hydrogen yield of 4.63 (mmol gas/g of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell)</b> was observed at the reaction time of 20  min, <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> loading of 0.06  g and temperature of 440  °C.|$|R

Notwithstanding, they can also act as a sink for airborne pollutants and excess moisture through adsorption. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) modified with <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> to regulate RH, toluene, limonene, dodecane and formaldehyde. The physicochemical properties, including molecular size/shape, vapour pressure, polarity and boiling point of VOCs allowed them to represent a range of pollutants. Adsorption and desorption behaviour of MDF containing up to 15 % <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> was evaluated in 2 -L environmental chambers under dynamic conditions at 23 °C and 50 % RH. The porous microstructure of the MDF and <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> and their chemical composition were analysed using SEM, XRD and FTIR. Compared to a control panel, <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> additions showed an improved ability to remove VOCs and formaldehyde from the indoor air and buffer humidity. Of particular significance was the irreversible sink effect of formaldehyde and dodecane. This was attributed to the porous surface of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> increasing the specific surface area of the panel and thus its adsorption capacity. The improved capacity of buffer humidity also increased the ability to adsorb water soluble VOCs such as formaldehyde.

40|$|Packed-bed digesters are an {{alternative}} to covered lagoon digesters for methane production and anaerobic treatment of dilute wastewaters such as dairy barn flush water. The physical media of packed-beds retain biofilms, often allowing increased treatment rates. Previous studies have evaluated several types of media for digestion of dilute wastewaters, but cost and media fouling have setback commercial development. A major operational cost has been effluent recirculation pumping. In the present effort, a novel approach to anaerobic digestion of flush dairy water was developed at pilot-scale: broken <b>walnut</b> <b>shells</b> were used as a low-cost packed-bed medium and effluent recirculation was replaced by reciprocation mixing to decrease pumping costs {{and the risk of}} media clogging. Three packed-bed digesters containing <b>walnut</b> <b>shells</b> as media were constructed at the on-campus dairy and studied for about six months. Over that time, several organic loading rates (OLRs), measured as both chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile solids (VS) were applied to the new packed-bed digesters to allow modeling of methane production. The influence of temperature on methane production was also investigated. Additionally, the study measured solids accumulation in the <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> packed-bed as well as the effectiveness and durability of <b>walnut</b> <b>shells</b> as packing media. Finally, a simple economic analysis was developed from the methane model to predict the financial feasibility of packed-bed digesters at flush water dairies under similar OLR conditions. Three methane production models were developed from organic loading: saturation-type (following the form of the Monod equation), power and linear. The models were evaluated in terms of regression analysis and the linearity of experimental to predicted methane production. The best model was then chosen to develop the economic predictions. Economic predictions for packed-bed digesters were calculated as internal rate of return (IRR) using the methane models along with additional input variables. Comparisons of IRRs were made using electric retail rates of $ 0. 10 to $ 0. 20 per kilowatt-hour and capital cost subsidies from zero to 50 %. Sludge accumulation in the packed-bed was measured via change in porosity, and <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> durability was measured as the change in mass of representative <b>walnut</b> <b>shells</b> {{over the course of the}} study. The linear-type model of methane production from volatile solids OLR best represented this data set. Digester temperature was not found to influence methane production in this study, likely due to the small daily average ambient temperature range experienced (14 °C to 24 °C) and the greater influence of organic loading. Porosity of the <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> packed-bed decreased from 0. 70 at startup to 0. 34 ± 0. 06 at the end of the six-month study, indicating considerable media fouling. Sludge accumulated in each digester from zero at startup to 281 ± 46 liters at termination. <b>Walnut</b> <b>shells</b> in the packed-bed lost on average 31. 4 ± 6. 3 % mass during the study period which may be attributed to degradation of more readily bio-degradable cellulose and hemi-cellulose within the <b>walnut</b> <b>shells.</b> Given the predicted methane production and media life, at present, the economic outlook for packed-bed digesters at commercial dairies is quite dependent on utility electrical rates, available subsidies and future improvements to packed-bed digester technology. The predicted IRRs ranged from below 0 % (at 0 % capital subsidy and $ 0. 10 /kWh) up to 25 % (at 50 % capital subsidy and $ 0. 20 /kWh) at large dairies (3000 milking cows). Increases in organic loading were not shown to necessarily increase IRR, particularly at OLRs above 10 g/Lliquid-d (as COD or VS). Ultimately, to better assess the value of packed-bed digesters for flush dairies, additional study is needed on topics such as sludge accumulation prevention, long-term <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> degradation, dairy barn flush water mixing, and more detailed economic analysis...|$|R
