25|$|When the {{conventions}} of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views {{in a speech to}} the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.|$|E

For {{a time he}} was a trustee of Princeton University, {{and was one of the}} majority of trustees who preferred Dean West's plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of Woodrow Wilson, then president of the university. Cleveland consulted occasionally with President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the Coal Strike of 1902. Cleveland still made his views known in political matters. In a 1905 article in The Ladies Home Journal, Cleveland weighed in on the women's suffrage movement, writing that [...] "sensible and responsible women do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence." ...|$|E

Schools found to be in violation could be expelled from the NCAA.

Time magazine asserted violators were far more widespread than those seven that had confessed. Maryland was the only Sinful Seven school that was also a major football power with eighty scholarship players, and Byrd led them in their stand against the Sanity Code. University of Virginia president Colgate Darden called the code hypocritical, and The Citadel's leadership refused to [...] "lie to stay in the association" [...] and requested termination of its NCAA membership. At the convention to decide Virginia's fate, Byrd said, [...] "Does Ohio State <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for expulsion of Virginia, when Ohio State has facilities to take care of four or five as many athletes as Virginia?" [...] The ensuing vote fell 25 short of the needed two-thirds majority to expel the Sinful Seven.|$|E

She was interested in social reform, and she was distressed at being paid much less than men with similar jobs, but she was amused at her father's enthusiasm over the Rochester women's rights convention.

The Muslim League was highly benefited with its activists who played crucial role in gathering support for the Pakistan Movement, specifically Jalal-u-din Baba, an ethinc Hazarewal. His strong activism with the Muslim League captured a strong mandate of Hazara District and Attock District.

6000|$|... ... There is {{a natural}} disgust {{in the minds of}} nearly all white people at the idea of an {{indiscriminate}} amalgamation of the white and black races; and Judge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself. If he can, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of that idea upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the storm. He therefore clings to this hope as a drowning man to the last plank. He makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the Dred Scott decision. He finds the Republicans insisting that the Declaration of Independence includes all men, black as well as white; and forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and proceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does, do so only because they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> and eat, and sleep, and marry with negroes! He will have it that they cannot be consistent else. Now I protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that because I do not want a black woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a wife. I need not have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some respects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one else, she is my equal, and the equal of all others.|$|E
60|$|If {{you wish}} a full {{understanding}} of the war, I repeat what I believe I said to you in a letter once before, that the whole, or nearly so, {{is to be found in}} the speech of Dixon of Connecticut. This I sent you in pamphlet as well as in the Globe. Examine and study every sentence of that speech thoroughly, and you will understand the whole subject. You ask how Congress came to declare that war had existed by the act of Mexico. Is it possible you don't understand that yet? You have at least twenty speeches in your possession that fully explain it. I will, however, try it once more. The news reached Washington of the commencement of hostilities on the Rio Grande, and of the great peril of General Taylor's army. Everybody, Whigs and Democrats, was for sending them aid, in men and money. It was necessary to pass a bill for this. The Locos had a majority in both houses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble saying: Whereas, War exists by the act of Mexico, therefore we send General Taylor money. The Whigs moved to strike out the preamble, so that they could vote to send the men and money, without saying anything about how the war commenced; but being in the minority, they were voted down, and the preamble was retained. Then, on the passage of the bill, the question came upon them, Shall we vote for preamble and bill together, or against both together? They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against sending help to General Taylor, and therefore they voted for both together. Is there any difficulty in understanding this? Even my little speech shows how this was; and if you will go to the library, you may get the Journal of 1845-46, in which you will find the whole for yourself.|$|E
