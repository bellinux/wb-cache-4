25|$|As the Watergate scandal {{heated up}} in mid-1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew became a target in an {{unrelated}} investigation {{of corruption in}} Baltimore County, Maryland of public officials and architects, engineering, and paving contractors. He was accused of accepting kickbacks in exchange for contracts while serving as Baltimore county executive, then <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>Governor</b> of Maryland and Vice President. On October 10, 1973, Agnew became the second Vice President to resign the office (after John C. Calhoun in 1832). That same day, he pleaded no contest to tax evasion in the sum of $13,551.47 for 1967. He was fined $10,000 and avoided prison time.

500|$|In December of {{the same}} year, {{allegations}} by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as [...] "Troopergate", the officers alleged that they arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated [...] "bad journalism", and that [...] "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives".|$|E
500|$|Conan brought Schwarzenegger {{worldwide}} {{recognition as}} an action star and established {{the model for}} most of his film roles: [...] "icy, brawny, and inexpressiveyet somehow endearing." [...] The image of him as the barbarian was an enduring one; when he campaigned for George H. W. Bush to be president, he was introduced as [...] "Conan the Republican"a moniker that stuck with him throughout his political career and was often repeated by the media during his term as Governor of California. [...] Schwarzenegger was aware of the benefits the film had brought to him, acknowledging the role of Conan as [...] "God's gift to [...] career." [...] He embraced the image: <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>Governor</b> of California, he displayed his copy of the Atlantean sword in his office, occasionally flourishing the weapon at visitors and letting them play with it. [...] More than once, he spiced up his speeches with Conan's [...] "crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women".|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Paula Jones {{initiated}} {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit against Clinton, claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright {{on the grounds that}} it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>Governor</b> of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing [...] "a pack of lies" [...] and [...] "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" [...] funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. Bennett said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.|$|E

500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>governor,</b> Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.'

He promptly publicly apologized after he was criticized by bloggers Gawker and Josh Marshall who called the remarks racist.
