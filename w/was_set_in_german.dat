5000|$|Timm started {{publishing}} {{in the early}} 1970s and became known to a larger audience in Germany after one of his children's books, Rennschwein Rudi Rüssel, {{was turned into a}} movie. Today {{he is one of the}} most successful contemporary authors in Germany. His books Die Entdeckung der Currywurst (The Discovery of Curried Sausage) and Am Beispiels meines Bruders (In my brother's shadow, or literally: [...] "By my Brother's Example") can both be found on the syllabi of German schools. His readers usually appreciate Timm's writing style, which he himself calls [...] "die Ästhetik des Alltags" [...] ("the aesthetics of everyday life"). Timm imitates everyday storytelling by using everyday vocabulary and simple sentences and generally tries to imitate the way stories are orally told. His works often indirectly link with each other by taking up minor characters from one story and making this character the main character of another work. For example, a minor character like Frau Brücker from Johannisnacht is taken up as a main character in his book Die Entdeckung der Currywurst. Timm's works also tend to have autobiographical features and often deal with the <b>German</b> past or <b>are</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> the <b>German</b> past.|$|R
5000|$|In the '90s, the Adventure Series {{was adapted}} for television. The main {{characters}} {{were all the}} same as in the books, but the stories <b>were</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> modern times.

[...] "The Mountain of Adventure" [...] <b>was</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> the <b>German</b> Alps, rather than the Welsh mountains as in the books. Also, many of the TV adaptations featured bumbling henchmen for comic relief. Probably the most notable henchman was Ray Uma's henchman, Taj, in [...] "The River of Adventure", who appeared to be more intelligent than his master, and had a major role in the episode's plot. The TV series also introduced a character who was not in the books- Sir George Houghton, Cunningham's rich, underworked boss, who appeared in every episode except [...] "The Valley of Adventure". A running gag was that he always phoned Cunningham with an urgent assignment just as the family were planning a holiday- in [...] "The Ship of Adventure", Bill had to postpone his wedding for this reason- yet Sir George appeared to be a gentleman of leisure. He was only seen doing real work a couple of times in the entire series- he was shown playing pool and golf, and on one occasion, he was seen fishing, though he lied that he was in the office.|$|R
5000|$|Keyserling's early novels Fräulein Rosa Herz. Eine Kleinstadtliebe (1887) and Die dritte Stiege (1892) were {{influenced}} by Naturalism. The later novels are more finely nuanced and less interested in assembling details. He is always interested in the interplay of light and natural objects. His novels and novellas <b>are</b> usually <b>set</b> <b>in</b> the <b>German</b> Baltic provinces, both in the noble houses and gardens {{and also in the}} fir forests and the outdoors generally. Most of his novels are suffused with a certain melancholy. They are peopled by minor aristocrats. Sometimes there are contrasting figures from a less exalted class; often this is a [...] "child of nature," [...] a person uncorrupted by civilization. Frequently there is a clash of generations. His novellas and novels, after 1902, place Keyserling at the forefront of German literary Impressionism. His essays on general and cultural questions, like his theater plays, are forgotten.|$|R
40|$|This volume {{contains}} fifteen {{sacred and}} secular songs {{for one to}} four voices with piano accompaniment. Contrary to the title page, the titles of each song are given either <b>in</b> <b>German</b> or German and Italian. When both languages {{are present in the}} text underlay, the Italian text sits directly below the staves with German below the Italian. Most songs either give "Singstimme" or a voice part for the vocal staves; some give names of characters, possibly indicating a theatrical or semi-dramatic performance context. Songs for one voice tend to be strophic while part songs are through-composed. Authors such as Gellert, Metastasio, and Shakespeare figure among the authors (most anonymous) of the texts. As with the other binlingual pieces in this volume, the scene "Arianna a Naxos" <b>is</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> Italian and <b>German.</b> The interaction of the soprano voice and piano accompaniment as well as the structural alternation between arioso/aria and recitative reveals this piece to be a solo cantata. The volume concludes with a four-page catalog of all of Breitkopf und Härtel's publications in Leipzig complete with price in thalers for each piece and a table of contents.

40|$|<b>German</b> Democratic Republic <b>in</b> 1984, {{five years}} before {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall, has been called the first {{accurate}} depiction of the psycho-logical terror wielded by the Stasi, the East German secret police, who safeguarded the dictatorship of the proletariat. The film is about the psy-chological and political transformation of a Stasi officer, Wiesler, who undertakes the surveillance of a prominent playwright and his actress lover. The mechanisms through which Wiesler comes to empathize and identify with the subjects of his investigation, as he observes and listens in on the rich blend of passion, poetry, and politics that characterizes their lives, are explored in depth. Wiesler’s transformation is based in part on the capacity to form implicit models of the behavior and experi-ences of others, based on the mirror neuron system, that Gallese and his colleagues call “embodied simulation. ” Underpinning the processes of empathy and identification so central to this film, embodied simulation is an unconscious and prereflexive mechanism through which the actions, emotions, and sensations we observe activate internal representations of the bodily and mental states of the other. Embodied simulation also expands our understanding {{of the power of the}} primal scene, which has long been identified as a major organizer of unconscious fantasies and conflicts throughout life, and which forms the central metaphor of the film. Embodied simulation scaffolds our aesthetic response to art, music, and literature, underlies the dynamics of spectatorship, and potentially catalyzes resistance to totalitarian mass movements. T he Lives of Others, a film written and directed by Florian Henckelvon Donnersmarck, <b>is</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> the <b>German</b> Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1984, a year with Orwellian overtones of faceless systems of oppression.
