5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been excluded, and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish to be the ones to do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E
5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts {{that she is a}} realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E
25|$|Schätzl {{could not}} remove her still intact PIP breast {{implants}} {{as a precaution}} (as recommended by Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) because she announced in January 2012 that she was five months pregnant and therefore did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> risk of a general anaesthetic in fear of harming her unborn child. Schätzl raised awareness about the problems women with the toxic implants faced; however, she never sold her interviews about this issue or her pregnancy for money to the press but helped with her media partners several women, who couldn't afford the operation, to have their implants replaced for free.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} reuniting the District of Columbia {{with the state}} of Maryland is {{referred}} to as retrocession. The District was originally formed out of parts of both Maryland and Virginia which they had ceded to the Congress. However, Virginia's portion was returned to that state in 1846; all the land in present-day D.C. was once part of Maryland. If both the Congress and the Maryland state legislature agreed, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland, possibly excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the United States Capitol, the White House and the Supreme Court building. If the District were returned to Maryland, citizens in D.C. would gain voting representation in the Congress as residents of Maryland. One problem with any of these proposals, according to one Virginia Republican in a 1999 interview, is that the state of Maryland does not currently <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> District back. Further, although the U.S. Constitution does not specify a minimum size for the District, retrocession may require a constitutional amendment, as the District's role as the seat of government is mandated by the Constitution's District Clause. Retrocession could also alter the idea of a separate national capital as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. It may also violate the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution's granting of votes in the electoral college, as they would still be constitutionally granted to the district.|$|E

In April 2007, The Newcastle Herald announced that Lasance would return to filming with Home and Away. He was signed another guest contract.

500|$|... "Wake Me Up" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by English-Irish girl group Girls Aloud from their second studio album, What Will the Neighbours Say? (2004). It was released by Polydor Records on 21 February 2005, as the fourth single from the album. The song had been initially considered as the lead single, however, it was deemed as sounding too harsh and the record company did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> risk. The track was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Shawn Lee, Lisa Cowling, Paul Woods and Yusra Maru'e. [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] is a pop rock song composed of a [...] "garage rock guitar riff". It received mixed reviews from music critics. While some described it as predictable, others wrote that {{it appeared to be}} an attempt to recapture the sound of some of their previous release. Alex Kapranos, the lead singer of indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, said [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] inspired the band to work with producer Brian Higgins.|$|E
500|$|Matheos and Portnoy {{initially}} considered {{having a}} different vocalist perform on each track; this idea was scrapped as they decided the constant change in vocalist would disrupt {{the flow of}} the album. Vocalists considered included Steve Walsh, Steve Hogarth, Steven Wilson and John Arch. Portnoy particularly pushed for Daniel Gildenlöw to sing on the album. Early on in the album's production, Gildenlöw wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics for two songs and completely wrote another song. Matheos liked Gildenlöw's ideas, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> music in the same direction Gildenlöw did. Moore ended up performing most of the vocals on the album. In order to keep the album from becoming too similar to Chroma Key, Matheos and Portnoy decided to feature a guest vocalist on one track. Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) wrote lyrics and performed vocals on the track [...] "ShutDOWN". He was chosen because his music in Porcupine Tree was similar in style to the music on the album. Portnoy also credited Wilson as [...] "a pioneer of his genre".|$|E
500|$|With the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) not {{performing}} well, Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston sought to replace [...] "Wild" [...] Bill Donovan as manager. Ban Johnson, [...] AL president, suggested Huggins to Ruppert {{as a replacement}} for Donovan. Huston, who had been in Europe at the time that Ruppert had made the appointment, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire Wilbert Robinson, his drinking buddy. Ruppert himself had been put off by Huggins' wool cap and practice of smoking pipes in public, which he felt was the mark of the working class. However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins upon Johnson's recommendation, and agreed that Huggins knew much about baseball. Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, who initially did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> position, as the Yankees were in no better a position than the Cardinals. J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News eventually convinced Huggins to accept the offer, and he signed a two-year contract. The hiring of Huggins drove a wedge between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling his shares of the team to Ruppert in 1922.|$|E

Peter is at first excited {{at the thought of}} his restaurant becoming the hangout for police officers, but eventually finds that Joe is actually bringing in fellow paraplegics. The restaurant becomes a huge success among handicapped customers, but Peter is disappointed that {{what was supposed to be}} a cool restaurant has become a [...] "cafeteria at the veterans hospital," [...] and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> profits for granted. Angered, Peter bans them from entering with a [...] "no shirt, no shoes, no legs, no service" [...] policy. Joe is perplexed why Peter would turn away loyal paying customers, much less a good friend like Joe, but Peter stubbornly refuses to allow handicapped customers. In response, the handicapped unite into a giant robot known as [...] "CrippleTron", which begins attacking the restaurant while Peter, Chris and Stewie are on the roof. Stewie eventually takes matters into his own hands and defeats CrippleTron, which falls on Peter, breaking one of his legs. After being taken to the hospital, Peter needs to use a wheelchair for two weeks while his broken leg heals. Peter apologizes to Joe, who accepts his apology on the basis that he is glad to see Peter understand the difficulties of being disabled and that he does not want to continue holding a grudge against Peter. The two make amends, and things go back to the way they were and Peter closes down the restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania {{to produce}} Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, {{following}} {{the success of}} their debut album. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album.
