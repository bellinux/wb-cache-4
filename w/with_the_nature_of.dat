5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E
25|$|Psycholinguistics is {{concerned}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the computations and processes {{that the brain}} undergoes to comprehend and produce language.

40|$|Cyclometalated Ir(III) {{complexes}} are {{of particular}} interest due to the wide tunability of their electronic structure via variation of their ligands. Here, a series of heteroleptic Ir-based photosensitizers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general formula [Ir(C^N) 2 (N^N) ]+ has been studied theoretically {{by means of an}} optimally-tuned long-range separated density functional. Focusing on the steady-state absorption spectra, correlations between the chemical modification of both ligand types <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant dark and bright electronic states are revealed. Understanding such correlations builds up a basis for the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems...|$|R
25|$|Monster is {{the ninth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band R.E.M., released in September 1994 on Warner Bros. Records. Co-produced by {{the band and}} Scott Litt and recorded in four different recording studios, Monster was an intentional stylistic shift from the group's preceding albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), consisting of loud, distorted guitar tones and simple song arrangements.

25|$|Historians {{sometimes}} {{consider this}} social factor {{to be extremely}} important, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the national economies involved.

Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created {{in the wake of the}} scientific revolution of the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Revolution {{prompted}} thinkers, such as Karl Marx {{with his}} theory of alienation, to concern themselves <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> work {{and its impact on}} workers. Taylor's (1911) Principles of Scientific Management as well as Mayo’s research in the late 1920s and early 1930s on workers at the Hawthorne Western Electric plant helped to inject the impact of work on workers into the subject matter psychology addresses. The creation in 1948 of the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan was important because of its research on occupational stress and employee health.|$|E
