5|$|The club's record home {{attendance}} is 23,002, for an FA Cup match against QPR on 10 January 1948, a record which <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> certainly never be broken unless the club relocates {{to a larger}} ground, given that Priestfield Stadium's current capacity is approximately half that figure.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> certainly be detected.|$|E
50|$|There <b>will</b> be <b>almost</b> 30 new superyachts {{displayed}} at the 2016 Monaco Yacht Show.|$|R
50|$|Choofers <b>will</b> burn <b>almost</b> any {{flammable}} liquid fuel, including kerosene, diesel fuel, or used sump oil.|$|R
50|$|Turtle Throws a Tantrum: Temper Tantrum Turtle <b>will</b> do <b>almost</b> {{anything}} to get her own way.|$|R
25|$|Cumbre Vieja is {{currently}} dormant, but <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> certainly erupt again. Day and Ward hypothesize that if such an eruption causes the western flank to fail, a mega-tsunami could be generated.|$|E
25|$|A Light Force is {{composed}} of a Pump Engine (200 Series, for example Engine 201 or Engine 301 for 100 stations)and a Ladder Truck. Light forces <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> always respond together as one unit or resource.|$|E
25|$|A {{square matrix}} {{that is not}} {{invertible}} is called singular or degenerate. A square matrix is singular {{if and only if}} its determinant is 0. Singular matrices are rare in the sense that a square matrix randomly selected from a continuous uniform distribution on its entries <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> never be singular.|$|E
50|$|They mostly eat toads, frogs, slugs, and worms, {{but they}} <b>will</b> eat <b>almost</b> {{anything}} that they can overpower.|$|R
50|$|If Purwokerto {{will become}} a {{autonomy}} city, now it has 292.782 people, <b>will</b> covering <b>almost</b> 98 km2 with 11 municipalities/kecamatan.|$|R
50|$|The {{dragonfly}} <b>will</b> eat <b>almost</b> any soft-bodied flying insect including mosquitoes, flies, small moths, mayflies, {{and flying}} ants or termites.|$|R
25|$|Then the {{simplest}} substantial mathematical {{conclusion is that}} if the average number of a man's sons is 1 or less, then their surname <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> surely die out, and if it is more than1, then there is more than zero probability that it will survive for any given number of generations.|$|E
25|$|Legacy - a rushee who {{is related}} {{to a member of}} the same {{fraternity}} or sorority they are rushing and <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> assuredly be offered a bid. Traditionally a legacy has a parent or sibling that is a member, some organizations have expanded on their definition of a legacy's relation to members.|$|E
25|$|Corruption {{is common}} among Sudanese {{government}} officials, who routinely act with total impunity, {{knowing that they}} <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> certainly not be investigated for any transgression. Sources have stated that the opportunities for corruption are created by an inefficient administration and bureaucracy, along with poor record-keeping {{and a lack of}} transparency. Bribes are commonly demanded by government employees.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{one part}} ice at 0 °C <b>will</b> cool <b>almost</b> exactly 4 parts water from 20 °C to 0 °C.|$|R
2500|$|So [...] is {{unbounded}} {{near the}} root, and Newton's method <b>will</b> diverge <b>almost</b> everywhere in any neighborhood of it, even though: ...|$|R
50|$|Red-veined meadowhawks <b>will</b> eat <b>almost</b> any soft-bodied flying insect such as mosquitoes, flies, small moths, mayflies, {{and flying}} ants or termites.|$|R
25|$|Since Albert's job is {{to visit}} the lower realm, Chris asks to be taken there to help Ann. Albert {{initially}} refuses, warning Chris that he might find himself stuck in the lower realm, thus delaying his eventual, inevitable reunion with Ann. Chris eventually convinces Albert to attempt the rescue, though Albert insists that they <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> certainly fail.|$|E
25|$|Decay {{from the}} 2p state by {{emitting}} a Lyman-α photon. This photon <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> always be reabsorbed by another hydrogen atom in its ground state. However, cosmological redshifting systematically decreases the photon frequency, {{and there is}} a small chance that it escapes reabsorption if it gets redshifted far enough from the Lyman-α line resonant frequency before encountering another hydrogen atom.|$|E
25|$|The surface mud of a pond, ditch, or lagoon <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> always yield some diatoms. They {{can be made}} {{to emerge}} by filling a jar with water and mud, {{wrapping}} it in black paper and letting direct sunlight fall {{on the surface of the}} water. Within a day, the diatoms will come to the top in a scum and can be isolated.|$|E
50|$|This {{dragonfly}} species <b>will</b> eat <b>almost</b> any soft-bodied flying insect including mosquitoes, flies, butterflies, moths, mayflies, {{and flying}} ants or termites.|$|R

50|$|The desert whitetail <b>will</b> eat <b>almost</b> any soft-bodied flying insect such as mosquitoes, flies, butterflies, moths, mayflies, {{and flying}} ants or termites.|$|R
25|$|There <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> {{always be}} a variety other participants, which can include {{friendly}} neighbor states, states sharing a coalition, and nongovernmental organizations. At the intergovernmental level, the highest decisions will be reached between diplomats at the HN foreign ministry or department of state, with the ambassadors of the nations providing FID being key players. The diplomatic level sets the highest policies.|$|E
25|$|As stated above, wavelength-converting transponders served {{originally}} {{to translate}} the transmit wavelength of a client-layer signal {{into one of the}} DWDM system's internal wavelengths in the 1,550nm band (note that even external wavelengths in the 1,550nm will most likely need to be translated, as they <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> certainly not have the required frequency stability tolerances nor will it have the optical power necessary for the system's EDFA).|$|E
25|$|Ideally, the {{advancing}} rear hoof oversteps {{the spot where}} the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.|$|E
3000|$|..., therefore, {{with the}} {{proposed}} SS strategy, sensing period Ts {{for each channel}} <b>will</b> be <b>almost</b> the same and more larger than PS strategy.|$|R
30|$|The new Burr {{distribution}} has modified unimodal (unimodal {{followed by}} increasing) hazard function, and when p increases, hazard function <b>will</b> be <b>almost</b> increasing.|$|R

25|$|Fucidin tablets and suspension, whose active {{ingredient}} is sodium fusidate, occasionally cause liver upsets, which can produce jaundice (yellowing {{of the skin}} and the whites of the eyes). This condition <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> always get better after the patient finishes taking Fucidin tablets or suspension. Other related side-effects include dark urine and lighter-than-usual feces. These, too, should normalize when the course of treatment is completed.|$|E
25|$|Close Order Drill {{is heavily}} {{emphasized}} {{early on in}} a Marine's training. Formal ceremonies, such as the Marine Corps Birthday Ball, a change of command, or a retirement, <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> always incorporate some form of close order drill. The Marine Corps uses close order drill to teach discipline by instilling habits of precision and automatic response to orders, increase the confidence of junior officers and noncommissioned officers through the exercise of command and give Marines an opportunity to handle individual weapons.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the general}} term 'liberalism' <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> always refer to modern liberalism, a more social variant of {{classical}} liberalism. In Europe, this social liberalism {{is closer to}} European Social democracy although the original form is advocated by some liberal parties in Europe as well, as with the Beveridge Group faction within the Liberal Democrats (United Kingdom), Liberals (Sweden), Danish Social Liberal Party, the Democratic Movement (France), the Italian Republican Party or the Free Democratic Party of Germany, for example.|$|E
