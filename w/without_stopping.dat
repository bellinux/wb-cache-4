5|$|A park pass is {{required}} for stopping {{in the park and}} permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park <b>without</b> <b>stopping.</b> Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway <b>without</b> <b>stopping.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tender {{included}} a corridor connection and tunnel {{through the water}} tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so that the driver and fireman could be changed <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> the train. The following year the locomotive appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman.|$|E

Sixteen people {{were waiting for the}} car near a building set up to debrief al-Balawi. Al-Balawi got out of the vehicle and detonated the explosives hidden in his suicide vest.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} {{opened to}} Jay Street on February 1, 1933, but the High Street station remained closed {{for an additional}} five months. The trains ran through the station <b>without</b> <b>stopping,</b> because the escalators to the street had not been completed {{due to lack of}} funding. That month, the contract for four escalators in the station was awarded to Otis Elevator Company. The station opened on June 24, 1933.|$|E
5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop time, is {{the interval}} that a diver may theoretically spend {{at a given}} depth without having to perform decompression stops. The NDL helps divers plan dives {{so that they can}} stay at a given depth and ascend <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> while avoiding unacceptable risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

5|$|Following {{training}} exercises {{with the}} 4th U-boat Flotilla from 9 September 1941 to 31 January 1942, U-162 began her first war patrol {{as the lead}} boat of the 2nd U-boat Flotilla on 1 February 1942. She left her home port of Kiel on 7 February and ventured into the North Sea <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> in occupied Norway. During 40 days at sea, U-162 sailed north of the British Isles and entered the North Atlantic, where she sank her first vessel, White Crest, on 24 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} little used and trains often passed through it <b>without</b> <b>stopping.</b> Its lack of {{patronage}} coupled with {{its proximity to}} other stations resulted in its closure in 1932. During the Second World War it {{was used as a}} bunker by prime minister Winston Churchill and his War Cabinet. The station building survives today and is close to Down Street's junction with Piccadilly. Part of it is now converted to a retail outlet.|$|E

5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with toll collection {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage <b>without</b> <b>stopping,</b> in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its {{clientele}} diminished, {{and for the first}} time in its existence it began to lose money. It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former chef of the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> its operation; this was achieved by annexing two town houses, joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten-year renovation cost a total of $250million. The restaurants were given a new look, and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, {{passenger}} services were reactivated between Wörth and Lauterbourg; for marketing reasons, this section {{has been designated}} as the Bienwaldbahn (Bienwald Railway). Since 1999, cross-country trips <b>without</b> <b>stop</b> have operated on Sundays between Wörth and Lauterbourg.|$|R
50|$|It {{lacked the}} direct route of its rival at Yarmouth Vauxhall, taking a winding path across Norfolk <b>without</b> <b>stops</b> at major towns. Instead of {{connecting}} Great Yarmouth directly with Norwich, passengers {{would have to}} change at the rural Melton Constable.|$|R
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{planning}} {{in the late}} 1980s for High Speed 1, British Rail considered building the line to serve a low-level station at King's Cross via south London. An option for this route was via Herne Hill, which would have required quadrupling the tracks on the Chatham Main Line between Shortlands and Herne Hill and on the City Branch to Loughborough Junction; {{it was estimated that}} this would have led to the loss of 90–180 homes in Lambeth. Although both a different route and London terminus for HS1 were eventually chosen (St Pancras via East London), Eurostar services linking London Waterloo to Brussels and Paris passed through Herne Hill <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> from 1994 until the completion of HS1 in November 2007. This marked the end of rail services to the continent via Herne Hill, which had been started by the LCDR in 1863 when the line between Victoria and Dover via Herne Hill was completed.|$|E
5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E
5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at a toll plaza located on Føyno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through the plaza once. However, traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo {{does not have to}} pay. Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage <b>without</b> <b>stopping,</b> in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount.|$|E
30|$|Tweet: we {{represent}} a tweet as bag of words. We removed all the stop words (based {{on the standard}} INQUERY stop list). The final representation is a clean tweet <b>without</b> <b>stop</b> words or useless words. We used t as a symbol for tweet object.|$|R
50|$|Continuous {{production}} {{is used for}} products that are made in a similar manner. For example, a certain car model has the same body shape and therefore, {{many of the same}} model cars can be made at the same time <b>without</b> <b>stop,</b> decreasing manufacturing cost.|$|R
50|$|The {{tunnel boring}} machine Barcino passed the Sagrada Família in October 2010, and reached its final {{destination}} a few months later.

5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city <b>without</b> <b>stopping.</b> Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, HMS King George V {{deployed}} {{in support of}} Convoy JW 51A, the first Russian convoy to sail direct from the United Kingdom <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> at Iceland. The journey was completed without incident. On receiving word of the German naval attack on Convoy JW 51B in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Barents Sea, King George V was dispatched along with nine other ships from Scapa Flow on 31 December to provide cover for the returning Convoy RA 51 and to attempt to catch the German ships engaged in the previous assault. The German ships were ultimately not encountered, and RA 51 was returned safely. King George V later provided a covering force for two further convoys during early 1943, before being transferred to the Mediterranean during May in preparation for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Promoted to commander on 30 June 1943, McNicoll took part in the Sicilian invasion the following month, with King George V serving as part of the covering force. Prior to the invasion, King George V, along with , had executed a bombardment of Trapani and the islands of Favignana and Levanzo on the night of 11/12 July, as part of a deception suggesting landings on the west coast of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race <b>without</b> <b>stopping</b> again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|E
5000|$|The {{need for}} high {{pressure}} makes it suitable for playing <b>without</b> <b>stop</b> using circular breathing. A small pacifier style disk that the lips may lean on helps the lip muscles {{that hold the}} high pressure air, rest and recover during long non stop playing sessions.|$|R
