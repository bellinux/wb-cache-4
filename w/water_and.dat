5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> in making probiotic drink by using Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei R- 68 isolated from dadih. The research was carried out experimentally using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with tree treatments and six replications. The treatments were J 1 S 1 (ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> 1 : 0), J 2 S 2 (ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> 3 : 1), J 3 S 3 (ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> 2 : 1), J 4 S 4 (ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> 1 : 1), J 5 S 5, (ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> 1 : 2) and J 6 S 6 (ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> 1 : 3). The data obtained were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and DNMRT at level 5 %. The results show that the best ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> significantly influenced (P< 0, 05) the pH, total lactic acid, total lactic acid bacteria, total solid, hedonic test at taste as well as descriptive test of colour. Based on the results of this research, it is concluded that best ratio of sweet <b>water</b> guava <b>and</b> <b>water</b> to produce probiotic drink was 1 : 3 (J 6 S 6) which pH 4. 17, total lactic acid 0. 73 %, total lactic of acid bacteria 8. 77 log CFU/ml, total solid 12. 95 % and hedonic test of colour 3. 55, aroma 3. 50 and taste 3. 58 as well as rather prefered by panelists...|$|R
