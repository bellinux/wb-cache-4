Odin <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> to the well Mímisbrunnr and will consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people. Yggdrasil, the cosmological tree, will shiver and all beings will be fearful. The gods and the einherjar will don their war gear and advance to Vígríðr. Odin, wearing a golden helmet, a coat of mail, and brandishing his spear Gungnir, <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> in the front.|$|E

5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
25|$|To {{calculate}} {{the weight of}} the displaced water, it is necessary to know its density. Seawater (1025kg/m³) is more dense than fresh water (1000kg/m³); so a ship <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> higher in salt water than in fresh. The density of water also varies with temperature.|$|E

25|$|The Air Force Network (AFNET), {{a robust}} digital {{information}} grid that enabled quick and accurate threat responses, {{was launched in}} 2010, helping the IAF become a truly network-centric air force. AFNET is a secure communication network linking command and control centres with offensive aircraft, sensor platforms and ground missile batteries. Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), an automated system for Air Defence operations <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> the AFNet backbone integrating ground and airborne sensors, weapon systems and command and control nodes. Subsequent integration with civil radar and other networks shall provide an integrated Air Situation Picture, and reportedly acts as a force multiplier for intelligence analysis, mission control, and support activities like maintenance and logistics. The design features multiple layers of security measures, including encryption and intrusion prevention technologies, to hinder and deter espionage efforts.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 51, High foretells {{the events}} of Ragnarök. After the god Heimdallr awakens all the gods by blowing his horn Gjallarhorn, they will {{assemble}} at a thing, Odin <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> to the well Mímisbrunnr and consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people, the world tree Yggdrasil will shake, and then the Æsir and the einherjar will don their war gear.

500|$|In chapter 51 of Gylfaginning, High {{describes}} {{the events of}} Ragnarök. High says that [...] "amid this turmoil the sky will open and from it <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> the sons of Muspell. Surtr <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> in front, and both before and behind him there will be burning fire. His sword will be very fine. Light will shine from it more brightly than from the sun." [...] High continues that when the sons of Múspell ride over the bridge Bifröst it will break, {{and that they will}} continue to the field of Vígríðr. The wolf Fenrir and the Midgard Serpent will also arrive there. By then, Loki will have arrived with [...] "all of Hel's people", Hrym, and all of the frost jötnar; [...] "but Muspell's sons will have their own battle array; it will be very bright". Further into the chapter, High describes that a fierce battle will erupt between these forces and the Æsir, and that during this, Surtr and Freyr will engage in battle [...] "and there will be a harsh conflict before Freyr falls". High adds that the cause of Freyr's death will be that Freyr is lacking [...] "the good sword" [...] that he once gave his servant Skírnir.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 17, High tells Gangleri {{that the}} {{location}} of Himinbjörg [...] "stands {{at the edge of}} heaven where Bifrost reaches heaven." [...] While describing the god Heimdallr in chapter 27, High says that Heimdallr lives in Himinbjörg by Bifröst, and guards the bridge from mountain jotnar while sitting at the edge of heaven. In chapter 34, High quotes the first of the two Grímnismál stanzas that mention the bridge. In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök. High says that, during Ragnarök, the sky will split open, and from the split <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> forth the [...] "sons of Muspell". When the [...] "sons of Muspell" [...] ride over Bifröst it will break, [...] "as was said above." ...|$|E
500|$|During all of this, the sky splits into two. From the split, the [...] "sons of Muspell" [...] ride forth. Surtr rides first, {{surrounded}} by flames, his sword {{brighter than the}} sun. High says that [...] "Muspell's sons" [...] <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> across Bifröst, described in Gylfaginning as a rainbow bridge, and that the bridge will then break. The sons of Muspell (and their shining battle troop) advance {{to the field of}} Vígríðr, described as an expanse that reaches [...] "a hundred leagues in each direction", where Fenrir, Jörmungandr, Loki (followed by [...] "Hel's own"), and Hrym (accompanied by all frost jötnar) join them. While this occurs, Heimdallr stands and blows the Gjallarhorn with all his might. The gods awaken at the sound, and they meet. Odin rides to Mímisbrunnr in search of counsel from Mímir. Yggdrasil shakes, and everything, everywhere fears.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 38, High {{says that}} there are many men in Valhalla, and many more who will arrive, yet they will [...] "seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] In chapter 51, High foretells that as part of the events of Ragnarök, after Fenrir's son Sköll has {{swallowed}} the sun and [...] his other son Hati Hróðvitnisson has swallowed the moon, the stars will disappear from the sky. The earth will shake violently, trees will be uprooted, mountains will fall, and all binds will snap – Fenrisúlfr will be free. Fenrisúlfr will go forth with his mouth opened wide, his upper jaw touching the sky and his lower jaw the earth, and flames will burn from his eyes and nostrils. Later, Fenrisúlfr will arrive at the field Vígríðr with his sibling Jörmungandr. With the forces assembled there, an immense battle will take place. During this, Odin <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> to fight Fenrisúlfr. During the battle, Fenrisúlfr will eventually swallow Odin, killing him, and Odin's son Víðarr will move forward and kick one foot into the lower jaw of the wolf. This foot will bear a legendary shoe [...] "for which the material has been collected throughout all time." [...] With one hand, Víðarr will take hold of the wolf's upper jaw and tear apart his mouth, killing Fenrisúlfr. High follows this prose description by citing various quotes from Völuspá in support, some of which mention Fenrir.|$|E
2500|$|Currently in {{development}} by Vancouver-based Sky Turtle Technologies is a ride called the Sky Caliber. In summer 2016, the Sky Caliber, {{opened at the}} Action Park site. Unlike the original Cannonball Loop, riders <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> in bullet-shaped aluminum cages. [...] The ride also features a considerably taller and steeper approach, {{as well as a}} teardrop shaped loop. [...] Current indications are that the slide will be called [...] "Cannonball Loop." [...] The ride features a vertical drop, a teardrop-shaped loop, and a coffin-shaped cage riders <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> in. It also has an emergency hatch, like the original Cannonball Loop.|$|E
2500|$|In chapter 41, the stanza from Grímnismál {{is quoted}} that {{mentions}} that Yggdrasil is the foremost of trees. In chapter 54, {{as part of}} the events of Ragnarök, High describes that Odin <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> to the well Mímisbrunnr and consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people. After this, [...] "the ash Yggdrasil will shake and nothing will be unafraid in heaven or on earth", and then the Æsir and Einherjar will don their war gear and advance to the field of Vígríðr. Further into the chapter, the stanza in Völuspá that details this sequence is cited.|$|E

2500|$|Brand arrives, {{telling him}} that he watched Oberon fail, and that Corwin must give him the Jewel so he can create a new Pattern. [...] Corwin refuses, and forces Brand to leave. He notices an unusually large storm {{following}} him, and takes refuge in a cave. [...] The cave's other occupant, a nameless stranger who has also sought shelter from the storm, casually mentions some local legends about the Archangel Corwin, who, according to scripture <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> before a storm {{at the end of}} the world. The real Corwin dismisses this story as nonsense and commands the Jewel to quell the storm. Eventually he falls asleep.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{development}} from trainspotting (almost {{unique to the}} UK) is the [...] "haulage basher" [...] or locomotive haulage enthusiast These individuals attempt to ride behind or in the cab (some people do not count the latter as proper [...] "haulage") of as many locomotives as they can, marking them off in a book as would a regular trainspotter. Even the shortest haulage will count, such as being hauled for {{a few hundred yards}} by a shunting locomotive when one portion of a train is being hooked up to another at a junction. In some cases fans who like the sound of a particular type of locomotive working hard hauling a train <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> behind them as much as possible, even following English-built locomotives exported abroad, Portugal's 1800 Class (similar to BR Class 50) being one example. [...] "Haulage bashers" [...] sometimes use unusual words and language known as [...] "basherspeak".|$|E
2500|$|Referee Hansson told Sveriges Radio Blekinge [...] "I cannot {{comment on}} the game itself but life must go on. I <b>will</b> <b>ride</b> this storm as well". In his first {{substantial}} {{comment on the}} incident, Hansson spoke to the regional Swedish newspaper [...] on 24 November. While repeating the fact that FIFA rules prevented him commenting on the game until the investigation concluded, he said the incident was neither his or his referee team's fault. Referring to a graphic illustration printed earlier in The Times and reproduced in some Swedish newspapers, he said [...] " [...] clears the whole refereeing team in this incident". The picture, titled 'Why the referee missed it', purported to show how neither the referee or the assistant referee could have seen the handball incident, due {{to the presence of}} three Irish players blocking Hansson's view from his position {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, and Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's position obscuring the sightline of the assistant referee, Nilsson, who was standing on the right hand touchline. He also stated that the reaction to the game had made him consider quitting his job as a referee. On 21 June, during the World Cup finals, Hansson said, [...] "After the game, we were sitting in the dressing room and I cried. I realized what a mistake it was." ...|$|E
