40|$|Background: Amyloid Beta (1 - 42) {{is derived}} from amyloid {{precursor}} protein and plays {{a critical role in}} AD pathogenesis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of 6 <b>weeks</b> of voluntary <b>wheel</b> running on brain Amyloid beta (1 - 42) in the diabetic rats induced with alloxan. Materials and Methods: 28 male rats weight 185 ± 1 were assigned randomly to 4 groups (N= 7) : normal control (C), training (T), control-diabetic (CD) and diabetic-training (DT). Diabetes was induced with injecting Alloxan (120 mg/kg dissolved in saline) intraperitoneal. Results: 6 <b>weeks</b> of voluntary <b>wheel</b> running decreased the cortex Aβ 1 - 42 in T and DT groups. Aβ 1 - 42 levels significantly decreased in the T and DT in compare with C and CD (p< 0. 001), respectively. Also Aβ 1 - 42 levels significantly increased in the CD in compare with C (p< 0. 001).

Affymetrix microarray and laser capture microdissection were used to assess the effect of exercise and stress on mRNA expression in the DRN.

40|$|New Findings What is {{the central}} {{question}} of this study? We used experimental evolution to determine how selective breeding for high voluntary wheel running and exercise training (7 – 11 weeks) affect ventilatory chemoreflexes of laboratory mice at rest. What is the main finding and its importance? Selective breeding, although significantly affecting some traits, did not systematically alter ventilation across gas concentrations. As with most human studies, our findings {{support the idea that}} endurance training attenuates resting ventilation. However, little evidence was found for a correlation between ventilatory chemoreflexes and the amount of individual voluntary wheel running. We conclude that exercise ‘training’ alters respiratory behaviours, but these changes may not be necessary to achieve high levels of wheel running. Ventilatory control is affected by genetics, the environment and gene–environment and gene–gene interactions. Here, we used an experimental evolution approach to test whether 37 generations of selective breeding for high voluntary wheel running (genetic effects) and/or long-term (7 – 11 <b>weeks)</b> <b>wheel</b> access (training effects) alter acute respiratory behaviour of mice resting in normoxic, hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions. As the four replicate high-runner (HR) lines run much more than the four non-selected control (C) lines, we also examined whether the amount of exercise among individual mice was a quantitative predictor of ventilatory chemoreflexes at rest. Selective breeding and/or wheel access significantly affected several traits. In normoxia, HR mice tended to have lower mass-adjusted rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Chronic wheel access increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production in both HR and C mice during hypercapnia. Breathing frequency and minute ventilation were significantly reduced by chronic wheel access in both HR and C mice during hypoxia. Selection history, while significantly affecting some traits, did not systematically alter ventilation across all gas concentrations. As with most human studies, our findings support the idea that endurance training (access to wheel running) attenuates resting ventilation. However, little evidence was found for a correlation {{at the level of the}} individual variation between ventilatory chemoreflexes and performance (amount of individual voluntary wheel running). We tentatively conclude that exercise ‘training’ alters respiratory behaviours, but these changes may not be necessary to achieve high levels of wheel running...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{locomotor}} training after {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) has primarily focused on hind limb recovery, with evidence of functional and molecular changes in response to exercise. Since trauma at a cervical (C) level is common in human SCI, we used a unilateral C 4 contusion injury model in rats to determine whether forced exercise (Ex) would affect spinal cord biochemistry, anatomy, and recovery of fore and hind limb function. SCI was created with the Infinite Horizon spinal cord impactor device at C 4 with a force of 200 [*]Kdyne and a mean displacement of 1600 – 1800 [*]μm in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats that had been acclimated to a motorized exercise wheel apparatus. Five days post-operatively, the treated group began Ex on the wheel for 20 [*]min per day, 5 days per week for 8 <b>weeks.</b> <b>Wheel</b> speed was increased daily according to the abilities of each animal up to 14 [*]m/min. Control rats were handled daily but were not exposed to Ex. In one set of animals experiencing 5 days of Ex, there was a moderate increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and heat shock protein– 27 (HSP- 27) levels in the lesion epicenter and surrounding tissue. Long-term (8 weeks) survival groups were exposed to weekly behavioral tests to assess qualitative aspects of fore limb and hind limb locomotion (fore limb scale, FLS and BBB [Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale]), as well as sensorimotor (grid) and motor (grip) skills. Biweekly assessment of performance during wheel walking examined gross and fine motor skills. The FLS indicated a significant benefit of Ex during weeks 2 – 4. The BBB test showed no change with Ex {{at the end of}} the 8 -week period, however hind limb grid performance was improved during weeks 2 – 4. Lesion size was not affected by Ex, but the presence of phagocytic and reactive glial cells was reduced with Ex as an intervention. These results suggest that Ex alone can influence the evolution of the injury and transiently improve fore and hind limb function during weeks 2 – 4 following a cervical SCI...|$|R

40|$|Skeletal muscles contain several subtypes of myofibers {{that differ}} in {{contractile}} and metabolic properties. Transcriptional control of fiber-type specification and adaptation has been intensively investigated {{over the past}} several decades. Recently, microRNA (miRNA) -mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation has attracted increasing attention. MiR- 23 a targets key molecules regulating contractile and metabolic properties of skeletal muscle, such as myosin heavy-chains and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PGC- 1 α). In the present study, we analyzed the skeletal muscle phenotype of miR- 23 a transgenic (miR- 23 a Tg) mice to explore whether forced expression of miR- 23 a affects markers of mitochondrial content, muscle fiber composition, and muscle adaptations induced by 4 <b>weeks</b> of voluntary <b>wheel</b> running. When compared with wild-type mice, protein markers of mitochondrial content, including PGC- 1 α, and cytochrome c oxidase complex IV (COX IV), were significantly decreased in the slow soleus muscle, but not the fast plantaris muscle of miR- 23 a Tg mice. There was a decrease in type IId/x fibers only in the soleus muscle of the Tg mice.

40|$|Physical {{exercise}} improves multiple {{aspects of}} hippocampal function. In {{line with the}} notion that neuronal activity is key to promoting neuronal functions, previous literature has consistently demonstrated that acute bouts of exercise evoke neuronal activation in the hippocampus. Repeated activating stimuli lead to an accumulation of the transcription factor ΔFosB, which mediates long-term neural plasticity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that long-term voluntary wheel running induces ΔFosB expression in the hippocampus, and examined any potential region-specific effects within the hippocampal subfields along the dorso–ventral axis. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were housed with or without a running <b>wheel</b> for 4 <b>weeks.</b> Long-term <b>wheel</b> running significantly increased FosB/ΔFosB immunoreactivity in all hippocampal regions measured (i. e., in the DG, CA 1, and CA 3 subfields of both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus). Results confirmed that wheel running induced region-specific expression of FosB/ΔFosB immunoreactivity in the cortex, suggesting that the uniform increase in FosB/ΔFosB within the hippocampus is not a non-specific consequence of running. Western blot data indicated that the increased hippocampal FosB/ΔFosB immunoreactivity was primarily due to increased ΔFosB. These results suggest that long-term physical exercise is a potent trigger for ΔFosB induction throughout the entire hippocampus, which would explain why exercise can improve both dorsal and ventral hippocampus-dependent functions. Interestingly, we found that FosB/ΔFosB expression i...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Exercise is an {{effective}} intervention to treat fatty liver. However, the mechanism(s) that underlie exercise-induced reductions in fatty liver are unclear.

40|$|Rationale: Studies {{in women}} with breast cancer, and in animal models, have {{demonstrated}} that chemotherapy can {{have a negative impact}} on cognitive function. Which chemotherapy agents cause problems with cognition and the aetiology of the impairment is unknown. Furthermore, there is no proven treatment. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU) and oxaliplatin (OX) chemotherapy agents commonly used to treat colorectal cancer on cognition in laboratory rodents. Furthermore, we assessed physical activity as a potential remedy for the observed chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficits. Results: In rodents, treatment with 5 FU and OX alone impairs memory as measured by novel object recognition. But combined treatment appears to have greater detrimental effects on hippocampal-dependent tasks, contextual fear recall and spatial reference memory (water maze), yet had no effect on cued fear recall, a non-hippocampal task. These impairments were prevented by 4 <b>weeks</b> of <b>wheel</b> running overnight after 5 FU/OX treatment. We found a significant interaction between chemotherapy and exercise: rats receiving both 5 FU/OX and exercise had improved cognition relative to non-exercising 5 FU/OX rats on novel object recognition and spatial reference memory. Conclusions: The combination 5 FU/OX had a significant impact on cognition. However, rats treated with 5 FU/OX that exercised post chemotherapy had improved cognition relative to non-exercising rats. This suggests that physical activity may prove useful in ameliorating the cognitive impairments induced by 5 FU/OX. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that regular physical exercise benefits health in part by counteracting some of the negative physiological impacts of stress. While some studies identified reductions in some measures of acute stress responses with prior exercise, limited data were available concerning effects on cardiovascular function, and reported effects on HPA axis responses were largely inconsistent. Given that exposure to repeated or prolonged stress is strongly implicated in the precipitation and exacerbation of illness, we proposed the novel hypothesis that physical exercise might facilitate adaptation to repeated stress, and subsequently demonstrated significant enhancement of both HPA axis (glucocorticoid) and cardiovascular (tachycardia) response habituation to repeated noise stress in rats with long-term access to running wheels compared to sedentary controls. Stress habituation {{has been attributed to}} modifications of brain circuits, but the specific sites of adaptation and the molecular changes driving its expression remain unclear. Here, in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to examine regulation of select stress-associated signaling systems in brain regions representing likely candidates to underlie exercise-enhanced stress habituation. Analyzed brains were collected from active (6 <b>weeks</b> of <b>wheel</b> running) and sedentary rats following control, acute, or repeated noise exposures that induced a significantly faster rate of glucocorticoid response habituation in active animals but preserved acute noise responsiveness. Nearly identical experimental manipulations also induce a faster rate of cardiovascular response habituation in exercised, repeatedly stressed rats. The observed regulation of the corticotropin-releasing factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor systems across several brain regions suggests widespread effects of voluntary exercise on central functions and related adaptations to stress across multiple response modalities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{builds on}} the {{findings}} that physical activity, such as wheel running in mice, enhances cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus of the common mouse strain C 57 BL/ 6, and that the baseline level of neurogenesis varies by strain, being considerably lower in DBA/ 2. Because C 57 BL/ 6 and DBA/ 2 are important as the parental strains of the BXD recombinant inbred cross which allows the detection of genetic loci regulating phenotypes such as adult neurogenesis, we performed the current study to investigate the gene x environment interactions regulating neurogenesis. At equal distances and times run DBA/ 2 J mice lacked the acute increase in precursor cell proliferation known from C 57 BL/ 6. In DBA/ 2 J proliferation even negatively correlated with the distance run. This was neither due to a stress response (to running itself or single housing) nor differences in estrous cycle. DBA/ 2 animals exhibited a delayed and weaker pro-neurogenic response with {{a significant increase in}} numbers of proliferating cells first detectable after more than a <b>week</b> of <b>wheel</b> running. The proliferative response to running was transient in both strains, the effect being undetectable by 6 weeks. There was also a small transient increase in the production of new neurons in DBA/ 2 J, although these extra cells did not survive.

40|$|The primary {{visual cortex}} is widely used to study brain plasticity, which is not only crucial for normal brain function, such as {{learning}} and memory, but also for recovery after brain injuries such as stroke. In standard cage raised mice, experience-dependent ocular dominance plasticity in the {{primary visual cortex}} declines with age and is compromised by a lesion in adjacent and distant cortical regions. In contrast, mice raised in an enriched environment exhibit lifelong ocular dominance plasticity and are protected from losing ocular dominance plasticity after a stroke-lesion in the somatosensory cortex. Since standard cage mice with an access to a running wheel displayed preserved ocular dominance plasticity during ageing, we investigated whether physical exercise might also provide a plasticity promoting effect after a cortical stroke. To this end, we tested if adult running wheel-raised mice preserved ocular dominance plasticity after stroke and also if short-term running after stroke restored ocular dominance plasticity to standard cage mice. Indeed, unlike mice without a running wheel, adult running wheel mice continued to show ocular dominance plasticity even after stroke, and a two <b>weeks</b> running <b>wheel</b> experience after stroke already restored lost ocular dominance plasticity. Additionally, the experience-enabled increase of the spatial frequency and contrast threshold of the optomotor reflex of the open eye, normally lost after stroke, was restored in both groups of running wheel mice.

40|$|Short-term (6 <b>weeks)</b> {{voluntary}} <b>wheel</b> running {{exercise in}} young female rats {{that were in}} an active growth phase resulted in whole-heart hypertrophy and myocyte concentric hypertrophy, when compared to sedentary controls. The cross-sectional area of ventricular myocytes from trained rats was significantly greater than for those isolated from sedentary rats, with the greatest change in morphology seen in sub-endocardial cells. There was no statistically significant effect of training on cell shortening {{in the absence of}} external mechanical loading, in [Ca 2 +]i transients, or in myofilament Ca 2 + sensitivity (assessed during re-lengthening following tetanic stimulation). Under the external mechanical load of carbon fibres, absolute force developed in myocytes from trained rats was significantly greater than in those from sedentary rats. This suggests that increased myocyte cross-sectional area is a major contractile adaptation to exercise in this model. Training did not alter the passive mechanical properties of myocytes or the relative distribution of titin isomers, which was exclusively of the short, N 2 B form. However, training did increase the steepness of the active tension-sarcomere length relationship, suggesting an exercise-induced modulation of the Frank-Starling mechanism. This effect would be expected to enhance cardiac contractility. Training lengthened the action potential duration of sub-epicardial myocytes, reducing the transmural gradient in action potential duration. This observation may be important in understanding the cellular causes of T-wave abnormalities found in the electrocardiograms of some athletes. Our study shows that voluntary exercise modulates the morphological, mechanical and electrical properties of cardiac myocytes, and that this modulation is dependent upon the regional origin of the myocytes...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) is {{implicated in}} the {{development}} of stress-related mood disorders in humans. Physical activity reduces the risk of developing stress-related mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. In rats, 6 <b>weeks</b> of <b>wheel</b> running protects against stress-induced behaviors thought to resemble symptoms of human anxiety and depression. The mechanisms by which exercise confers protection against stress-induced behaviors, however, remain unknown. One way by which exercise could generate stress resistance is by producing plastic changes in gene expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The DRN has a high concentration of 5 -HT neurons and is implicated in stress-related mood disorders. The goal of the current experiment was to identify changes in the expression of genes that could be novel targets of exercise-induced stress resistance in the DRN. Adult, male F 344 rats were allowed voluntary access to running wheels for 6 weeks; exposed to inescapable stress or no stress; and sacrificed immediately and 2 hours after stressor termination. Laser capture microdissection selectively sampled the DRN. mRNA expression was measured using the whole genome Affymetrix microarray. Comprehensive data analyses of gene expression included differential gene expression, log fold change (LFC) contrast analyses with False Discovery Rate correction, KEGG and Wiki Web Gestalt pathway enrichment analyses, and Weighted Gene Correlational Network Analysis (WGCNA). Our results suggest that physically active rats exposed to stress modulate expression of twice the number of genes, and display a more rapid and strongly coordinated response, than sedentary rats.

40|$|In {{maturing}} rats, {{the growth}} of abdominal fat is attenuated by voluntary wheel running. After the cessation of running by wheel locking, a rapid increase in adipose tissue growth to a size {{that is similar to}} rats that have never run (i. e. catch-up growth) has been previously reported by our lab. In contrast, diet-induced increases in adiposity have a slower onset with relatively delayed transcriptomic responses. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify molecular pathways associated with the rapid increase in adipose tissue after ending 6 wks of voluntary running at the time of puberty. Age-matched, male Wistar rats were given access to running wheels from 4 to 10 weeks of age. From the 10 th to 11 th week of age, one group of rats had continued wheel access, while the other group had one <b>week</b> of <b>wheel</b> locking. Perirenal adipose tissue was extracted, RNA sequencing was performed, and bioinformatics analyses were executed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA was chosen to assist in the understanding of complex 'omics data by integrating data into networks and pathways.

IPA identified 646 known transcripts differentially expressed (p < 0. 05) between continued wheel access and wheel locking. In wheel locked rats, IPA revealed enrichment of transcripts for the following functions: extracellular matrix, macrophage infiltration, immunity, and pro-inflammatory. These findings suggest that increases in visceral adipose tissue that accompanies the cessation of pubertal physical activity are associated with the alteration of multiple pathways, some of which may potentiate the development of pubertal obesity and obesity-associated systemic low-grade inflammation that occurs later in life...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} demonstrated that exercise activity increases {{the expression of}} the myokine Irisin in skeletal muscle, which is able to drive the transition of white to brown adipocytes, likely following a phenomenon of transdifferentiation.

In accordance with these new findings, we hypothesized that Irisin is directly involved in bone metabolism, demonstrating its ability to increase the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into mature osteoblasts. Firstly, we confirmed that myoblasts from mice subjected to 3 <b>weeks</b> of free <b>wheel</b> running increased Irisin expression compared to nonexercised state. The conditioned media (CM) collected from myoblasts of exercised mice induced osteoblast differentiation in vitro {{to a greater extent than}} those of mice housed in resting conditions. Furthermore, the differentiated osteoblasts increased alkaline phosphatase and collagen I expression by an Irisin-dependent mechanism. Our results show, for the first time, that Irisin directly targets osteoblasts, enhancing their differentiation. This finding advances notable perspectives in future studies which could satisfy the ongoing research of exercise-mimetic therapies with anabolic action on the skeleton...|$|R
40|$|Despite the classically held {{belief of}} an “all-or-none” {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system, differential responses in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) can occur acutely at varying magnitudes and in opposing directions. Sympathetic nerves also appear to contribute differentially to various disease states including hypertension and heart failure. Previously we have reported that sedentary conditions enhanced responses of splanchnic SNA (SSNA) but not lumbar SNA (LSNA) to {{activation of the}} rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in rats. Bulbospinal RVLM neurons from sedentary rats also exhibit increased dendritic branching in rostral regions of the RVLM. We hypothesized that regionally specific structural neuroplasticity would manifest as enhanced SSNA but not LSNA following activation of the rostral RVLM. To test this hypothesis, groups of physically active (10 – 12 <b>weeks</b> on running <b>wheels)</b> or sedentary, male Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented to record mean arterial pressure, LSNA and SSNA under Inactin anesthesia and during microinjections of glutamate (30 nl, 10 mM) into multiple sites within the RVLM. Sedentary conditions enhanced SSNA but not LSNA responses and SSNA responses were enhanced at more central and rostral sites. Results suggest that enhanced SSNA responses in rostral RVLM coincide with enhanced dendritic branching in rostral RVLM observed previously. Identifying structural and functional neuroplasticity in specific populations of RVLM neurons may help identify new treatments for cardiovascular diseases, known to be more prevalent in sedentary individuals...|$|R
40|$|Exercise {{has been}} {{recommended}} to improve motor function in Parkinson patients, but its value in altering progression of disease is unknown. In this study, {{we examined the}} neuroprotective effects of running wheel exercise in mice. In adult wild-type mice, one <b>week</b> of running <b>wheel</b> activity led to significantly increased DJ- 1 protein concentrations in muscle and plasma. In DJ- 1 knockout mice, running wheel performance was much slower and Rotarod performance was reduced, suggesting that DJ- 1 protein is required for normal motor activity. To see if exercise can prevent abnormal protein deposition and behavioral decline in transgenic animals expressing a mutant human form of α-synuclein in all neurons, we set up running wheels in the cages of pre-symptomatic animals at 12 months old. Activity was monitored for a 3 -month period. After 3 months, motor and cognitive performance on the Rotarod and Morris Water Maze were significantly better in running animals compared to control transgenic animals with locked running wheels. Biochemical analysis revealed that running mice had significantly higher DJ- 1, Hsp 70 and BDNF concentrations and had significantly less α-synuclein aggregation in brain compared to control mice. By contrast, plasma concentrations of α-synuclein were significantly higher in exercising mice compared to control mice. Our results suggest that exercise may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease by preventing abnormal protein aggregation in brain...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{interact}} with their environment in a myriad of ways. One central component of this interaction is behavior. Critical for many behaviors are the neurobiological mechanisms for motivation, which depend on the neural reward pathway. If {{the outcome of a}} behavior is rewarding in some way, then the behavior will be reinforced by the reward pathway and subsequently will occur with heightened frequency or intensity or both. I characterized modifications in the reward pathway in lines of house mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running. I measured dopamine receptor densities in these high-runner (HR) mice and in non-selected control (C) lines in brain regions involved in reward and motor ability, characterized brain mass and volume, and juxtaposed competing rewards with wheel running to test incentive salience. I also assessed withdrawal symptoms in HR mice by comparing cardiovascular measures before, during, and following two <b>weeks</b> of <b>wheel</b> access. Finally, I administered an analog of erythropoietin (EPO) and measured hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, maximal aerobic capacity (V O 2 max), and wheel running to test whether further increases in running in the HR phenotype may be limited by oxygen (O 2) transport or V O 2 max. Dopamine receptor densities did not differ between HR and C lines in the brain regions tested (caudate-putamen and prefrontal cortex). However, HR mice had higher brain masses (excluding cerebellum) when corrected for body mass, and larger midbrain volumes. When HR mice were given simultaneous access to wheels and solutions of artificial sweeteners, they consumed less of the artificial sweeteners than C mice suggesting an altered incentive salience for the sweet-taste reward. Additionally, HR mice displayed a reduction in blood pressure during withdrawal from running. Following EPO administration, [Hb] and V O 2 max were elevated, but not wheel running, suggesting that HR mice are not limited by O 2 transport or V O 2 max. In conclusion, my research supports the hypothesis that the reward pathway is altered in HR mice. Also, my results provide evidence for both neurobiological and physiological changes that have evolved as components of the HR phenotype. Taken together, these findings offer new insight into the proximate control of behavior...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to examine whether routine {{physical}} activity limits stress-induced tissue remodeling processes that lead to cardiac fibrosis. A secondary aim {{was to take the}} first steps to explore a potential and novel underlying mechanism, wherein a cardiac urocortin 2 /corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2 β pathway may be activated during physical activity and involved in reducing fibrotic processes. C 67 BL/ 6 J male mice were divided into four groups (n= 8 /group); sedentary control, voluntary running control, sedentary/stress and voluntary running/stress. Mice in the voluntary running groups were given 24 -hour unlimited access to a running wheel in the home cage for 9 <b>weeks</b> with <b>wheel</b> running activity recorded continuously. During the 9 th week of running, mice in the stress groups were exposed to a 5 day resident-intruder social stress paradigm that is considered to model human post traumatic stress outcomes and has been shown to induce cardiovascular fibrosis. Ventricular cardiac tissue was collected for analysis {{at the end of the}} experiment. We found that mice in the voluntary running groups ran an average of 4. 75 ± 1 km each day with the majority of running bouts occurring within the first 6 hours of the dark cycle. Interestingly, running behavior essentially ceased in mice exposed to stress. Running distance dropped to 0. 31 km following the first day of stress. Some habituation to stress occurred, as running distance increased to 1. 12 km by the 5 th day of stress but was still significantly lower then pre-stress running distances and distances recorded in non-stressed mice. Quantitative RT-PCR showed a 2 -fold increase in ventricular urocortin 2 gene expression in the sedentary/stress group, while levels were slightly lower in the voluntary running/stress group with a 1. 78 -fold increase over controls. CRF-R 2 β expression was not significantly altered. TGF-β, a signaling molecule known to induce fibrosis, showed slight elevation in expression in the stress group. Total protein was isolated from heart ventricles and we are in the process of performing Western blots to assess levels of specific proteins that are indicative of fibrosis. Complete findings will be presented at the Linfield College Student Symposium this spring...|$|R
40|$|It was {{previously}} found that voluntary wheel running induces {{an increase in}} the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, i. e., the GLUT 4 isoform, in rat plantaris muscle (K. J. Rodnick, J. O. Holloszy, C. E. Mondon, and D. E. James. Diabetes 39 : 1425 - 1429, 1990). The present study was undertaken to determine whether 1) the increase in muscle GLUT 4 protein is associated with an increase in maximally stimulated glucose transport activity, 2) a conversion of type IIb to type IIa or type I muscle fibers plays a role in the increase in GLUT 4 protein, and 3) {{an increase in the}} GLUT 1 isoform is a component of the adaptation of muscle to endurance exercise. Five <b>weeks</b> of voluntary <b>wheel</b> running that resulted in a 33 % increase in citrate synthase activity induced a 50 % increase in GLUT 4 protein in epitrochlearis muscles of female Sprague-Dawley rats. The rate of 2 -deoxy-glucose transport maximally stimulated with insulin or insulin plus contractions was increased approximately 40 % (P less than 0. 05). There was no change in muscle fiber type composition, evaluated by myosin ATPase staining, in the epitrochlearis. There was also no change in GLUT 1 protein concentration. We conclude that an increase in GLUT 4, but not of GLUT 1 protein, is a component of the adaptive response of muscle to endurance exercise and that the increase in GLUT 4 protein is associated with an increased capacity for glucose transport...|$|R
