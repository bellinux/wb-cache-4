5|$|Lucy Stone {{was born}} on August 13, 1818, on her family's farm at Coy's Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. She was the eighth of nine {{children}} born to Hannah Matthews and Francis Stone; she grew up with three brothers and three sisters, two siblings having died before her own birth. Another member of the Stone household was Sarah Barr, “Aunt Sally” to the children– a sister of Francis Stone who had been abandoned by her husband and left dependent upon her brother. Although farm life <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> for all and Francis Stone tightly managed the family resources, Lucy remembered her childhood as one of “opulence,” the farm producing all the food the family wanted and enough extra to trade for the few store-bought goods they needed.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{in way of}} work {{opportunities}} for Heaphy in Nelson and he based himself in Motueka. Here he farmed land with a friend, Frederick Moore and this took much of what little funds he had. His farming venture <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> and not particularly successful. By late 1843, the New Zealand Company {{was in need of}} good pastoral land around Nelson. It had clashed with Māori in the Wairau Affray in the Wairau Valley, to the south-east of Nelson and several company employees, including Arthur Wakefield, were killed. The company needed to scout the area to the south-west and Heaphy finally got the chance to explore.|$|E

Taylor was caught LBW for 62 in a rare lapse of concentration in an otherwise well made innings, and Boon was dismissed 42 runs later, out for 94.

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work,</b> I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough.

A speech-language clinician using his methodology was to explain to her client the nature of the many attitudes and behaviors of stutterers. Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work.</b> As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but tough on adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering.|$|E

[...] Underneath, the ice continued to move northwards, and by April 1916, the floe they were on was nearly within sight of Elephant Island but beginning to break up. Shackleton ordered the expedition to the lifeboats, placing Worsley in charge of one of them, the Dudley Docker.

500|$|For Part 2, Steve Miner asked Carl Fullerton, the make-up effects supervisor, {{to stick}} to Savini's {{original}} design, but Fullerton only had one day to design and sculpt a new head. Fullerton drew a rough sketch of what he believed Jason should look like, and had it approved by Miner. Fullerton added long hair to the character. Gillette had to spend hours in a chair as they applied rubber forms all over his face, and had to keep one eye closed while the [...] "droopy eye" [...] application was in place. Gillette's eye was closed for twelve {{hours at a time}} while he was filming the final scenes of the film. False teeth created by a local dentist were used to distort Gillette's face. Much of the basic concept of Fullerton's design was eliminated for Part 3. Miner wanted to use a combination of the designs from Tom Savini and Carl Fullerton, but as work progressed the design began to lean more and more toward Savini's concept. Stan Winston was hired to create a design for Jason's head, but the eyes were level and Doug White, the make-up artist for Part 3, needed a droopy right eye. White did keep Winston's design for the back of the head, because the crew did not have the time to design an entirely new head for Jason. The process of creating Jason's look <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> for White, who had to constantly make alterations to Richard Brooker's face, even up to the last day of filming.|$|E
500|$|Marrara Oval {{became the}} 89th Test venueand the eighth in Australia.

Bangladesh {{collapsed}} and were bowled out for 97 within three hours, with only Mohammad Ashraful (23) and Khaled Mahmud (21) providing resistance. [...] All four Australian bowlers chimed in, as Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee took three wickets apiece. McGrath and Jason Gillespie surpassed the duo of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall as Australia's most successful opening-bowling combination. Bangladesh's shot selection did not impress coach Dav Whatmore who said, [...] "A few players presented their wickets and that's just the area we're trying to improve." [...] Australia initially struggled {{to come to terms with}} the pitch, falling to 2/43 when Ricky Ponting was dismissed for 10. Darren Lehmann started the carnage, scoring his second Test century (110). Steve Waugh then became only the second player after Gary Kirsten to score a century against all Test playing nations. Upon reaching the milestone, he promptly declared Australia's innings on 7/407. Only Bangladesh's fastest bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza proved threatening, taking three wickets for 74 runs (3/74) in 23 overs. After the days play, Lehmann said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> out there. They stuck to their guns pretty well, they put it in the right areas and made it tough to score runs."

She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work.</b> I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert.

2500|$|At most times, Rome's {{thoroughfares}} {{would have}} been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens jostling about their business, in {{a great variety of}} colourful garments, with few togas in evidence. Only a higher-caste Roman, a magistrate, would have had lictors to clear his way, and even then, wearing a toga <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work.</b> Its apparent natural simplicity and [...] "elegant, flowing lines" [...] were the result of diligent practice and cultivation; its wearer must walk with measured, stately gait, or risk an embarrassing disarrangement. In this respect, Wilson (1924), after experiment with various fabrics, found the rough texture of the woolen toga a practical necessity; smoother fabrics refused to stay in their proper place. Vout (1966) suggests that the toga's most challenging qualities as garment fitted the Romans' view of themselves and their civilization. Like the empire itself, the peace that the toga came to represent had been earned through the extraordinary and unremitting collective efforts of its citizens, who could therefore claim [...] "the time and dignity to dress in such a way".|$|E
