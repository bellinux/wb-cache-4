Reviewing their files, he decides to concentrate his efforts on Michael Scofield, mastermind of the breakout. He tracks the escapees to Oswego, Illinois, but they manage to escape. Mahone continues to pursue Michael and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to avoid him on several occasions. While investigating a car explosion Mahone is shown to have a drug problem, swallowing pills concealed in a pen.|$|E

5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is {{an extended period of}} nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|Music is {{important}} to the locals of Cortina, with a guitar found in most houses, and young musicians are often found walking the streets. Every year, from the end of July to early August, Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died when he was only 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to benefit from classes with some of the world's leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina's own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires.|$|E

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap {{can be added to}} a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{presents}} evidence that globalization is creating a new class divide: those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E

5|$|Tintin and Haddock {{meet the}} detectives Thomson and Thompson, who {{reveal that the}} wounded man at Marlinspike was Syldavian. Tintin surmises that Calculus had invented an {{ultrasonic}} device capable of {{being used as a}} weapon of mass destruction, which both Syldavian and Bordurian intelligence agents are now seeking to obtain. Discovering that Bordurian spies have kidnapped Calculus and are holding him hostage in their Rolle embassy, Tintin and Haddock seek to rescue him, but during the attempt he is captured by Syldavian agents, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to escape by plane to their home country. The next morning, Tintin and Haddock learn that Bordurian fighter aircraft forced down the Syldavian plane and captured Calculus, who is now being held in Borduria. They travel to Borduria's capital, Szohôd, intent on rescuing him.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
