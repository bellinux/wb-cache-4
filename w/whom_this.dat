5|$|According to estimates, around 77,980 Armenians {{lived in}} the US by 1919. An {{unprecedented}} number of Armenians entered the country in 1920, but the Immigration Act of 1924 that restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US. Most of the post-World War I immigrants were women and children, {{in contrast to the}} prewar immigration, which was predominantly young and male. Like Italians, for <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> practice was known as campanilismo, Armenian communities were often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. This practice almost entirely disappeared after World War II.|$|E
5|$|One of Bach's {{predecessors}} {{as director}} musices of the Neukirche in Leipzig was Melchior Hoffmann. Around 1707 he composed a German Magnificat based on Luther's German {{translation of the}} Magnificat. The portfolio of performance parts of this composition was updated until well into Bach's time in Leipzig. The work, known as Kleine Magnificat (Little Magnificat), was for some time attributed to Bach, but later listed as spurious in the BWV catalogue (BWVAnh.21 / Anh. III 168‑>). BWV189, a Visitation cantata on a libretto that paraphrases {{the text of the}} Magnificat canticle, also seems rather to have been composed by Hoffmann than by Bach, to <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> work used to be attributed.|$|E

5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The {{block of ice}} was found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, Leonard Compagno {{proposed}} a separate genus for the slender smooth-hound: Gollum, after the character in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, [...] "to <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> shark bears some resemblance {{in form and}} habits." [...] He placed Gollum with the finback catsharks (Proscylliidae), but also noted its many anatomical similarities to the false catshark (Pseudotriakis microdon). At the time, Compagno chose to maintain Pseudotriakis as the sole {{member of the family}} Pseudotriakidae because of its numerous unique traits. More recently, he and other taxonomists have increasingly tended to group Gollum and Pseudotriakis together in the family Pseudotriakidae. This arrangement was corroborated by a 2006 phylogenetic study by Juan Andrés López and colleagues, which found that the two genera have a high degree of genetic similarity across four protein-coding genes and form a natural clade apart from Proscyllium. An additional species of Gollum has now been described, and {{there is at least one}} additional species yet to be described.|$|E
500|$|The early {{reports that}} General Howe sent to his {{superiors}} in London concerning the battles at Trenton and Princeton attempted to minimize their significance, blaming Rall for Trenton, {{and trying to}} recast Princeton as a nearly successful defense. [...] Not everyone was fooled by his accounts, in particular Lord Germain. [...] In {{a letter to the}} Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister Germain wrote that [...] "the officer who commanded [...] and to <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> misfortune is to be attributed has lost his life by his rashness." [...] Heister in turn had to report the loss to his ruler, Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, with the news that not only had an entire brigade been lost, but sixteen regimental colors and six cannon as well. [...] The news reportedly enraged Frederick, who broadly suggested that Heister return home (which he did, turning over command of the Hessian forces to Wilhelm von Knyphausen). [...] Frederick also ordered extensive inquiries into the events of 1776, that took place in New York from 1778 to 1782. [...] These inquiries created a unique archive of materials about the campaign.|$|E

500|$|Dwight Taylor was the {{principal}} screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that [...] "it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee", and [...] "I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour". [...] Allan Scott, for <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> movie served as his first major project, and who {{would go on to}} serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: [...] "For the women the kiss, for the men the sword" [...] which originally ran: [...] "For the men the sword, for the women the whip." [...] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared [...] "a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture {{can be summed up in}} the word inconsequentiality. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.'" [...] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.|$|E
500|$|Working with Ashfield, Pick's {{impact on}} London's {{transport}} system was considerable. Transport historian Christian Wolmar considers it [...] "almost impossible {{to exaggerate the}} high regard in which [...] was held during its all too brief heyday, attracting official visitors {{from around the world}} eager to learn the lessons of its success and apply them in their own countries" [...] and that [...] "it represented the apogee of a type of confident public administration... with a reputation that any state organisation today would envy... only made possible by the brilliance of its two famous leaders, Ashfield and Pick." [...] In his obituary of Pick, Charles Holden described him as [...] "the Maecenas of our time." [...] Writing in 1968, Nikolaus Pevsner described Pick as [...] "the greatest patron of the arts <b>whom</b> <b>this</b> century has so far produced in England, and indeed the ideal patron of our age." [...] Considering Pick's public statements on art and life, art historian Kenneth Clark suggested that [...] "in a different age he might have become a sort of Thomas Aquinas". Historian Michael Saler compared Pick's influence on London Transport to that of Lord Reith on the BBC's development during the same inter-war period. Urban planner Sir Peter Hall suggested that Pick [...] "had as much influence on London's development in the twentieth century as Haussmann had on that of Paris in the nineteenth", and historian Anthony Sutcliffe compared him to Robert Moses, the city planner responsible for many urban infrastructure projects in New York.|$|E
