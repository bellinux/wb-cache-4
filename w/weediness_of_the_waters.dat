40|$|International audienceA Europe-wide {{survey was}} {{conducted}} by sending questionnaires to weed scientists in order to evaluate currently troublesome weeds and those which may cause problems in the future. Recipients were asked to list species that are spreading and cause problems in agroecosystems, and to rate these according to three scores (degree <b>of</b> <b>weediness,</b> degree <b>of</b> spread potential, and degree of control success), with three levels for each score (low, medium and high). In total, 281 species were reported from 26 European countries. Most of them were annuals (48 %), followed by perennials (34 %) and biennials (14 %). There were significant differences in weed scores among these life forms. Weed scores were unrelated to each other, implying that they have different meanings with respect to <b>the</b> biology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species.

40|$|Biological invasions {{have caused}} {{tremendous}} ecological and socio-economic damages worldwide. Therefore, {{it is important}} to develop methods for their effective management. Biological invasion is a process of adaptive evolution in which hybridization and introgression {{play an important role in}} promoting invasive species by changing their invasiveness. Therefore, understanding how <b>the</b> genetic mechanisms <b>of</b> hybridization and introgression influence biological invasion will facilitate effective control <b>of</b> invasive species. <b>The</b> escape <b>of</b> transgenes with special functions into populations of wild relatives through hybridization and introgressionmay change <b>the</b> invasiveness and <b>weediness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild relatives, causing undesired environmental problems. This paper introduces <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> hybridization and introgression in adaptive evolution and speciation, and discusses how an alien species can change its adaptability, competitive ability, and invasiveness in new habitats through introgressive hybridization. Hybridization and introgression can cause polyploid and homoploid evolution of plant species, thereby influencing <b>the</b> fitness <b>of</b> new species and promoting <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> an invasive species in new habitats. At the same time, with <b>the</b> rapid development <b>of</b> transgenic technologies, transgenic crops are being extensively released into the environment for commercial production. Biological invasion is a complicated evolutionary and ecological process, and future research should investigate <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> hybridization and introgression in biological invasions in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myriad factors that influence the process...|$|R
