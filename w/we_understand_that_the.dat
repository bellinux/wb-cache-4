5|$|Victoria Rink - A game of Hockey will {{be played}} at the Victoria Skating Rink this evening, between two nines chose from among the members. Good fun may be expected, {{as some of the}} players are reputed to be {{exceedingly}} expert at the game. Some fears have been expressed on the part of intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game {{will be played}} with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.|$|E
25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of things, <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E

40|$|The {{short fiber}} mixing method {{is well known}} as one of the method to improve the {{strength}} of gran- ular soils in geotechnical engineering. Mechanical properties of the short fiber mixing granular materials are influenced by many factors, such as the mixture ratio of the short fiber, the material of short fiber, the length, and the orientation. In particular, the mixture ratio of the short fibers is very important in mixture design. In <b>the</b> past study, <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strength is reduced by too much short fiber mixing by a series of tri-axial compression experiments. Namely, there is “optimum mixture ratio” in the short fiber mixing granular soils. In this study, to consider the mechanism of occurrence of the optimum mixture ratio, we carried out the numerical experiments by granular element method. As <b>the</b> results, <b>we</b> can <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strength decrease when too much grain-fiber contact points exist, because a friction coefficient is smaller than the grain-grain contact points...|$|R

The unfortunate man was to all appearance dead. He had fallen on a part of the road which had been recently macadamised; and his face, we are informed, is frightfully mutilated by contact with the granite. The policeman conveyed him to the neighbouring hospital, where it was discovered that he was still alive, and the promptest attentions were immediately paid him. <b>We</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surgeon in attendance considers it absolutely impossible that he could have been injured as he was, except by having been violently thrown down on his face, either by a vehicle driven at a furious rate, or by a savage attack from some person or persons unknown. In the latter case, robbery could not have been the motive; for the unfortunate man's watch, purse, and ring were all found about him. No cards of address or letters of any kind were discovered in his pockets, and his linen and handkerchief were only marked with the letter M. He was dressed in evening costume--entirely in black. After what has been already said about the injuries to his face, any recognisable personal description of him is, for the present, unfortunately out of the question. We wait with much anxiety to gain some further insight into this mysterious affair, when the sufferer is restored to consciousness.
