Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen <b>White</b> <b>Coal</b> and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
25|$|Hydroelectric power {{stations}} continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower {{was referred to}} as <b>white</b> <b>coal</b> for its power and plenty. Hoover Dam's initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW Grand Coulee Dam in 1942. The Itaipu Dam opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the Three Gorges Dam in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including Norway, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Paraguay and Brazil, with over 85% of their electricity. The United States currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric {{power stations}} that supply 6.4% of its total electrical production output, which is 49% of its renewable electricity.|$|E

40|$|Painting <b>coal</b> <b>white</b> {{was used}} as a {{punishment}} in the British armed services. It was a tedious act worsened by the redundancy of the action. It’s not just the ridiculous nature of painting <b>coal</b> <b>white</b> that intrigued me but as a metaphor for artistic practice. Creating something out of nothing or changing the way the viewer looks at the world, challenging what is perceived as real and providing visual stimulus is what the artist is expected to do. There is an association with or assumption of magic to artistic practice. As if an artist fulfils the role of a present day sorcerer or alchemist. This work explores the magic of the creative process and the punishment an artist endures for taking this path. The installation was exhibited in the 'Allotments' exhibition at the Schwartz Gallery 2010. The installation consisted of a pile of coal that had been individually painted white.

In 1880 the Ute ceded the area to European settlement, in preparation for their relocation to reservations elsewhere in Colorado and Utah the following year. Prospectors swarmed into the area, looking for all types of mineral deposits.In 1882, one of them, John Cleveland Osgood, was sent by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CBQRR), which bought some of its coal from his employer, the <b>White</b> Breast <b>Coal</b> Company. His visit was part of a general survey of the state's coal resources, and he found them desirable enough that he set up the Colorado Fuel Company the following year to supply the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, a CBQRR subsidiary, with coal.

The depot served a line from Glen Jean to coal mines in Summerlee and Lochgelly; it initially served as both a checkpoint for coal cars from these mines and a freight and passenger station for the newly incorporated town of Oak Hill. The station's opening led to a commercial boom in Oak Hill, which transformed from a farming community to a commercial center with multiple banks, hotels, and stores. The Virginian Railway leased the depot in 1912 and ultimately bought it in 1922. The depot continued to provide passenger and freight service to Oak Hill until after World War II, when passenger service to Oak Hill ended [...] The depot became part of the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1957 and provided freight service for the railway until it closed to trains in 1983.|$|R

When violence broke out, he was quick to send state troops to quell the violence, and he was adamantly opposed to the importation of armed men by either side, using troops to enforce state laws against it. The most notable incidents of the day were at Virden (where imported armed men had fired on Illinois strikers), at Pana (racial strife between <b>white</b> and black <b>coal</b> miners, with the governor siding against the position of the white miners), and Carterville (where unarmed African Americans were shot by white miners, an incident vehemently condemned by the governor).|$|R

30|$|The {{focus is}} on Taiheiyo Coalmine as the company that took the {{modernization}} of its management system further than other mines. In the space of just 10 years, Taiheiyo Coalmine carried out major reforms in five areas – employee status, wages, labor-management relations, housing support and employee welfare – bringing the working lives of mine workers {{more in line with}} salaried workers and making their lifestyle more consistent with other Japanese citizens. These changes were underpinned by Taiheiyo Coalmine’s mechanization of production in step with other industries. Taiheiyo Coalmine’s move took up a shift to the Japanese-style production system that occurred in other industries during the period of high economic growth. This paper sets out to elucidate the transformation of the work environment and the change in workers’ attitudes. It also addresses one exceptional case of the <b>white</b> collarization of <b>coal</b> miners, which Koike (1981) referred to as the “birth of white-collar workers” in the Japanese manufacturing industries, concerning their wage system and housing based on the case of Taiheiyo Coalmine.|$|R

White's company was hit by two fires from 1884-1887 and the entrepreneur was forced to rebuild a safer, brick structure. White's factory was eventually expanded and it became the mill for the furniture store that White founded in 1894-1895 with the completion of the White Building.|$|R
