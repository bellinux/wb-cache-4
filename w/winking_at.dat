25|$|William Ball's 1976 American Conservatory Theater production, {{starring}} Fredi Olster and Marc Singer. This celebrated {{production was}} grounded {{very much in}} commedia dell'arte, with acrobats, clowns, pantomime-style violence, over-the-top posturing (Petruchio is depicted shirtless for almost the entire performance), much highly choreographed physicality {{on the part of}} the two leads, and an on-stage audience of clowns who provided on-going sound-effects, such as drums for punches and whistles for people fainting. This production dropped Sly altogether. Katherina's final speech is delivered in an ironic manner, with Olster <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> the audience, before grabbing a confused Petruchio and kissing him passionately. The production was broadcast by PBS in 1976 as part of their Great Performances series, with the TV presentation directed by Kirk Browning.|$|E
25|$|Ronaldo was {{the second-highest}} scorer in the European {{qualification}} for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match {{of the group}} stage. In the quarter-finals against England, his Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction, the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal. Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award, citing his behaviour {{as a factor in}} the decision.|$|E
25|$|Smuggling {{activity}} in Britain became more prevalent though the Tudor and Stuart period reaching its peak {{at the end}} of the 18th century. High rates of duty were levied on imported wine, spirits, and other luxury goods to pay for Britain's expensive wars with France and the United States. Cornwall was a haven for smugglers at this time, with its many secluded coves ideally suited for evasion of the duty, a smuggling provided a highly profitable venture for impoverished fishermen and seafarers. St Buryan was no different in this respect, and also home to smuggling activity. Thomas Johns, a known smuggler and agent of smugglers, was the landlord of the Kings Arms public house, formerly on the site of Belmont House in the village square, who divided his time between St Buryan and his liquor establishments in Roscoff, Brittany. More famous still was the Lamorna wink public house near Lamorna Cove which was also a base for smugglers. The pub was so named as <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> the barman would reputedly allow you to purchase smuggled spirits.|$|E

With the exception of Minnie and myself, it seemed to be the merriest coach party ever assembled at Lyndhurst.|$|R

500|$|In August 2006, {{the founders}} of the Orb - Paterson and Cauty - {{released}} Living in a Giant Candle <b>Winking</b> <b>at</b> God, their debut album as the Transit Kings with Guy Pratt and Pratt's associate, Dom Beken. The album featured appearances from Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr and comedian Simon Day. Beken described Living in a Giant Candle <b>Winking</b> <b>at</b> God as [...] "self-consciously musically written and less sample-based" [...] compared to the members' previous work. Living had been in production since 2001, but due to members' other obligations, it was delayed for several years. The album received mixed critical reactions, with reviewers such as The Sun comparing the album favourably to the music of DJ Shadow and Röyksopp while other publications, such as The Times, called it [...] "Orb-lite" [...] and proclaimed it to be [...] "Deep Forest-style sludge". Soon after the album's release, Cauty left the Transit Kings on [...] "extended leave", leaving the project in indefinite limbo. Paterson and Beken reunited in 2008 as High Frequency Bandwidth, an ambient hip hop group on the Malicious Damage label.|$|E
500|$|Blane {{was amazed}} by the {{recreation}} and understanding of her designs by fans. When she first heard that people were dressing up, {{she thought it would}} be tacky, but was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that [...] "the best part is when everyone leaves with a big smile on their face", noting that there's [...] "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> you". The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E
500|$|Tintinologist Phillipe Goddin {{considered}} the series to be [...] "a milestone", describing it as [...] "full of promise" [...] and containing [...] "plety [...] of humour, rich in developments". The Tintinologists Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier commented that [...] "Everything that made Tintin what it later became was seminally present in Totor", including the artistic style, {{the pace of}} the story, the use of humour, {{and the manner in which}} it imitated motion pictures. They also commented that Totor read like [...] "an adult was retelling one of those early American western serials... to a group of children. On the one hand he is exciting the children, but on the other he is <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> the adults as if to say, [...] "you and I know this is not serious."" ...|$|E

500|$|Even the novel's {{language}} bridges this divide. Waters often {{employs the}} word [...] "queer" [...] {{to describe the}} unusual or remarkable, instead of its post-1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality. She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual {{as it applies to}} gender, or Nan's own emotions toward Kitty. Nan's father uses the symbol of the oyster, what he calls a [...] "real queer fish" [...] that exhibits both male and female characteristics, and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man. The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying appraises Nan's first male costume, and is troubled by the [...] "queerness" [...] of it because she looks too much like a man, instead of a woman pretending to be a man. Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes, [...] "gay girls", Waters is <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> her readers.|$|E
500|$|According to Cuse, {{the show}} was purposefully set in 1893, exactly 100 years before the series premiered in 1993. Brisco {{is meant to be}} aware of the {{imminent}} changes in society and technology and actively looks for them. The writers of the show, and also the character of Brisco, refer to this concept as [...] "The Coming Thing". Elaborating on this theme, Campbell said, [...] "Basically this show is about the turn of the century, when the Old West met the Industrial Era. Cowboys still chew tobacco and ride the range and states are still territories but, over the horizon, is the onset of electricity, the first autos and telephones. Brisco is in the middle of a transition from the past to the future." [...] The collision of cowboy characters with puzzling technology and other anachronisms generates humor throughout the series. The writers made it a point to insert scenes mirroring the pop culture of the 20th century, from the apparent invention of the term [...] "UFO" [...] in the pilot episode to the appearance of a sheriff who looks and acts like Elvis Presley. Speaking about the humor of the show, Campbell said, [...] "I would say 30 percent of each episode is being played for laughs. But it's not a <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> the camera, Airplane-type of humor. We're funny like Indiana Jones is funny; the laughs come primarily from the wide variety of ridiculous, colorful characters that come in and out of this series." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{said on the}} episode's DVD audio {{commentary}} {{that while}} the episode was [...] "full of funny moments", it caused [...] "nothing but trouble" [...] to {{the staff of the}} show. One of the troubles was that after the episode had been written by Swartzwelder, an unsolicited writer sent the staff a script which contained a virtually identical story. To avoid a lawsuit, the staff paid him US$3000 and went forward with the episode. Material cut from the episode's script included many couples who were supposed to be at the retreat instead of the Flanders family, such as Mr. Burns and his mail-order bride, and Mrs. Krabappel trying to reunite with her estranged husband Ken Krabappel. Reiss said the scene played out [...] "horribly badly", and it appeared as if Mr. Burns's mail-order bride was a prostitute. The Ken Krabappel character was supposed to be based on singer Dean Martin, but somehow he ended up with a southern accent that made him sound like a hick. The whole scene was rewritten with help from producer James L. Brooks and it was completed after several hours. A scene in which Moe asked Dr. Hibbert to cure his discolored feces was also removed during the first reading of the script after a complaint by Brooks. Series creator Matt Groening later expressed an objection to the ending, which sees General Sherman jumping {{out of the water and}} <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> the camera, believing it to be overly cartoony.|$|E

500|$|The kiss {{generated}} strong {{reaction from}} {{the media and the}} celebrities alike. Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not much has changed — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but I wonder what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. On the same tour, the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] contained samples from the remix [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove".|$|E
500|$|Michael Cragg of The Guardian gave a {{positive}} review for {{the video and}} wrote: [...] "Superstars are at their best when they're simultaneously aware and unaware of their own ridiculousness and that's what Marry the Night delivers for Lady Gaga." [...] Daily News Kathryn Kattalia compared Gaga with Madonna in several scenes in the video. Kattalia further praised the dancing during the video, describing it as [...] "her best". However, she criticized the scenes of nudity noting: [...] "The rest of the video is pretty tame by Gaga standards." [...] Spins Marc Hogan wrote that [...] "it's hard to tell where Gaga is <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> us and where she's simply fallen into a foxhole of unrestrained ego." [...] Camille Mann of CBS News described the video as a [...] "avant-garde short film" [...] and noted that Gaga was [...] "pushing [...] boundaries." [...] Leah Collins of Dose compared Gaga's outfits with Christian Louboutin's designs. She further compared the set in the video to the cover artwork of Born This Way and called it a [...] "very fashionable recreation of Girl, Interrupted." [...] A writer of CNN commented, [...] "Lady Gaga is known for creating evocative mini-movies to provide the visuals for her singles, and 'Marry the Night' is no different." [...] Describing the video as [...] "rough" [...] and [...] "enigmatic", Liz Raftery of People further commened that it [...] "will certainly leave fans talking, if not scratching their heads." [...] An editor of ABC News praised Gaga's [...] "interesting perspective in the video." [...] NMEs Priya Elan wrote that Gaga sounds like [...] "a lobotomized Carrie Bradshaw" [...] during the introduction. He also commented, [...] "It's definitely an improvement on 'Judas', but could it maybe have been snipped a bit to make it shorter?" ...|$|E
500|$|The seventh season {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics, although increasingly critical reviews were more common this season. While critics enjoyed {{many of the}} episodes, many also felt that, as a whole, the season was the weakest of the show's original seven. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News praised the season, noting that it was [...] "proof that The X-Files still has more than enough creative life in it to justify an eighth season". He called many of the stand-alone episodes [...] "wonderfully creepy" [...] and noted that the season possessed a [...] "terrific bunch of episodes". Thomas Doherty from Cinefantastique gave the season a mixed review and noted that the series was hurt by the partnership between Mulder and Scully [...] "settl into the comfortable groove of a modern two career marriage—supportive, professionally rewarding, and utterly sexless." [...] Further, he noted that [...] "the most entertaining episode lately have been the self parodies, where killer cockroaches scurry and living dead roam, or where (in the Duchovny written and directed episode) Scully and Mulder are played by Téa Leoni and Garry Shandling in a motion picture only slightly more ludicrous than a 1998 motion picture called The X-Files." [...] Doherty argued that the [...] "self-parody" [...] style of the series caused viewers to not take it seriously anymore, explaining that, [...] "No longer going for the big chill, Carter and company are <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> their audience, as if to say: even we can't pretend to believe in this muddled mishmash anymore." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, was positive towards {{the first half of}} the season, but soon saw the episodes in more of a negative light. He wrote, [...] "A season that began with such hope ended with a sense of sorrow given the end result of the season-long backstage wheeling and dealing [...] Not even the magnificent season finale [...] could erase the nagging doubts I had that a series that had been so amazing for so long would soon embark upon a new course wrought with pitfalls and turmoil." [...] The A.V. Club noted that while the first eight seasons of The X-Files were [...] "good-to-great", the seventh season of the show was [...] "flagging" [...] and possessed [...] "significant problems.|$|E
