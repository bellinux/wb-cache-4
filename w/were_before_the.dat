5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they <b>were</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} California Constitution of 1849 {{called for}} elections every two years, with no set start {{date for the}} term. An amendment ratified in 1862 increased the term to four years, and the 1879 constitution set the term to begin on the first Monday in January following an election. In 1990, Proposition 140 led to a constitutional amendment implementing a term limit of two terms; prior to this limit, only one governor, Earl Warren, served more than two terms. Jerry Brown {{was able to be}} elected to a third term in 2010 because his previous terms <b>were</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> term limit was enacted. The 1849 constitution also created the office of lieutenant governor, who, in cases of vacancy in the office of governor, becomes governor. The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same ticket.|$|E

Secondly, every event must be at {{a certain number of}} instants; two events are simultaneous if they are at the same instant, and one <b>is</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> other if there is an instant, at which the one is, which is earlier than some instant at which the other is. Thirdly, if we assume that there is always some change going on somewhere during the time when any given event persists, the series of instants ought to be compact, i.e. given any two instants, there ought to be other instants between them. Do instants, as we have defined them, have these properties? ...|$|R

25|$|The allied armies, heavily {{involved}} in domestic politics, neglected their military duties and through poor planning and administration bought different rifles with different calibers. This hampered the instruction of conscripts, arms maintenance, and the supply of ammunition. The Peruvian navy warships <b>were,</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war, manned with Chilean sailors and, as the war began, {{they had to be}} replaced by foreign crews. Bolivia had no navy. The allied armies had nothing comparable to the Chilean cavalry and artillery.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone, {{along with}} its {{metabolite}} dihydrotestosterone, is extremely important to normal sexual functioning in men and women. Dihydrotestosterone is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women. Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are, on average, about half of what they <b>were</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> women were 40. Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; {{this is because the}} ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.|$|E

25|$|Most ethnic Hungarians of Romania live {{in areas}} that <b>were,</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 1920 Treaty of Trianon, parts of Hungary. Encompassed in a region known as Transylvania, the most {{prominent}} of these areas is known generally as Székely Land (Ținutul Secuiesc, Szekelyföld), where Hungarians comprise the majority of the population, comprising Harghita and Covasna counties and parts of Mureș county. Transylvania also includes the historic regions of Banat, Crișana and Maramureș. There are forty-one counties of Romania; Hungarians form a large majority of the population in the counties of Harghita (85.21%) and Covasna (73.74%), and a large percentage in Mureș (38.09%), Satu Mare (34.65%), Bihor (25.27%), Sălaj (23.35%) and Cluj (15.93%) counties.|$|E

O'Donnell's column was intercepted and in the Battle of Margalef on 23 April, it was routed with heavy losses. This action was followed by a siege in which Suchet used brutal methods to bring a speedy surrender. On 13 May, García Conde capitulated with his 7,000 surviving soldiers. This event was the start of an astonishing series of successful sieges from 1810 to 1812 in which Suchet's troops seemed to be unstoppable.|$|E

25|$|During occupation, ethnic {{tensions}} were raised and nationalism grew. The Malayans were thus {{on the whole}} {{glad to see the}} British back in 1945, but things could not remain as they <b>were</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war, and a stronger desire for independence grew. Britain was bankrupt and the new Labour government was keen to withdraw its forces from the East as soon as possible. Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.|$|E
25|$|Salomon {{realised}} {{that his}} nephew had no talent for trade {{and it was}} decided that Heine should enter the law. So, in 1819, Heine went to the University of Bonn (then in Prussia). Political life in Germany was divided between conservatives and liberals. The conservatives, who were in power, wanted to restore things to the way they <b>were</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution. They were against German unification because they felt a united Germany might fall victim to revolutionary ideas. Most German states were absolutist monarchies with a censored press. The opponents of the conservatives, the liberals, wanted to replace absolutism with representative, constitutional government, equality before the law and a free press. At the University of Bonn, liberal students were at war with the conservative authorities. Heine was a radical liberal {{and one of the first}} things he did after his arrival was to take part in a parade which violated the Carlsbad Decrees, a series of measures introduced by Metternich to suppress liberal political activity.|$|E

In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 {{representing}} the USSR. The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters. Nigel Short was rated the third {{best player in}} the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650; in the 21st century such a rating would only be good enough for a player to reach the top 100 or so, with the third {{best player in the}} world usually rated around 2800. Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they <b>were</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms, making norms easier to get and allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.|$|E

The match focuses mainly on the two Novatos Hombre Bala, Jr. and Zavala as they worked hard to show that they had the wrestling skills to work at a higher level than they <b>were</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> tournament. The match went the full three falls.

Following the match the rudo team were presented with trophies as a visual representation of their victory. Afterwards Escorpión touted the values of the Sonora wrestling school that he and Zavala both had trained {{at the beginning of their}} careers.|$|E
