5000|$|The estate {{versions}} {{had some}} interesting features. All had split tailgates - the rear windscreen would wind {{down into the}} bottom part, which could then be folded down. On the one hand, this allowed the access to the cargo compartment without opening the full tailgate. On the other, this meant that a rear <b>window</b> <b>heater</b> could never be installed in estates. Additionally, the 1500 GL version's cargo floor, which doubled as the cover for the spare wheel (stowed flat), could be removed and, thanks to four folding legs, converted into a picnic table! [...] A 1500 Familial version had two child seats (facing each other) in the cargo compartment, and a luggage rack on the roof.|$|E
5000|$|Inside, {{the vehicle}} had a {{completely}} new interior, with headrests on all seats, a new polyurethane coated dashboard with integrated instrument clusters and steering column controls for windscreen wipers/washers and indicator/high beam lights, rear <b>window</b> <b>heater</b> and other features. Chassis-wise the vehicle featured a vacuum servo assisted split-contour braking system, front disc brakes, radial tyres and [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub caps. The prototypes were powered by a 2990 cc GAZ-24-14 V6 with a cast iron cylinder block originally developed for the GAZ-24, and the identical GAZ-24-18, with an aluminium block. Both engines produced 136 hp, but the latter was much lighter in weight. The shown GAZ-3101 prototypes also featured automatic transmission, power steering, electric windows and air conditioning. Like its predecessors, the prototypes took part in much publicised tours of the USSR, and GAZ was ready to begin its pre-conveyor batches in 1978.|$|E

25|$|In general {{ceramics}} {{are typically}} inert {{and are not}} sensitive to elevated light levels. However, extreme changes in temperature and humidity can cause chemical and physical damage. Typically museums strive to store ceramics, {{as well as many}} other material types, in a stable temperature of 68°F with ± 3°. Additionally relative humidity should be stabilized at 50% also with a ±5%. Storing objects near <b>windows,</b> <b>heaters,</b> fireplaces, and exterior walls can create an unstable environment with temperature and humidity fluctuation and increase potential for damages.|$|R
50|$|On January 30, 2008 Hoffman and {{his father}} were on an American Airlines flight from San Juan to Philadelphia. During the flight the plane's cockpit caught on fire. It was later {{discovered}} that a fuse in the <b>window's</b> <b>heater</b> blew causing an electrical fire. The plane made an emergency landing at Palm Beach International Airport 90 minutes after the plane's cabin filled with smoke. 7 people {{were sent to the}} hospital including the captain and the co-pilot. The co-pilot was treated for cuts he sustained to his face when the plane's windshield shattered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Heating {{elements}} are commonly embedded in vehicle glazing, {{usually in the}} form of arrays of conductors, to provide a demisting or deicing function. Numerical models, based on representative vehicle geometry and simple conductor arrays, have been used to investigate the potential impact of such structures on the electromagnetic characteristics of vehicles. The results suggest that <b>window</b> <b>heaters</b> may significantly change both the emissions and immunity characteristics of vehicles. It is therefore concluded that it is essential to represent such features in electromagnetic models that are to be used in support of automotive EMC analysis. These results also have corresponding implications for the selection of vehicles in both emissions and immunity testing...|$|R
50|$|Optimal {{placement}} of building elements (e.g. <b>windows,</b> doors, <b>heaters)</b> {{can play a}} significant role in insulation by considering the impact of solar radiation on the building and the prevailing breezes. Reflective laminates can help reduce passive solar heat in pole barns, garages, and metal buildings.|$|R
50|$|The station's only {{entrance}} is via an elevated station house beneath the tracks that has four street stairs, two {{to either side}} of New Utrecht Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. The station house has cherry red doors, a clad wood trim exterior, and beige interior. There are also glass block <b>windows</b> and <b>heaters.</b> The fare control consists of a token booth, turnstile bank, waiting area, and two staircases to each platform at their center.|$|R
30|$|One-dimensional {{nanowires}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important types of nanomaterials with great potential applications in nanoelectronics and photoelectronics [1, 2]. Due to the interesting optical and electrical properties, In 2 O 3 with direct bandgap of around 3.6 eV has enabled many kinds of applications, such as <b>window</b> <b>heaters,</b> solar cells [1, 2], field-effect transistors [3], field emission devices [4], and various sensors [5 – 7]. Last decades, intense investigation of In 2 O 3 nanowires has been made. Up to now, In 2 O 3 nanowires have been synthesized by a variety of methods. These methods fall into two categories depending on whether a catalyst is used or not during nanowires growth. Without catalysts, In 2 O 3 nanowires can be synthesized via a vapor–solid (VS) mechanism by carbonthermal evaporation [10 – 12], or by directly thermal evaporation of In particles [14]. Patterning by use of templates [8, 9] and oxidation of indium compound [13] have also been conducted to synthesize In 2 O 3 nanowires in the absence of catalysts. When catalysts are used, nanowires can be synthesized on different substrates by a vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism [15 – 17]. Even vertical arrays can be grown under special conditions [18], mostly by using Au catalyst. Other catalysts such as Ag and In have also been reported [19, 20].|$|R

The 220.8 in long, 80.1 in wide vehicle came with such standard features as windshield washers, a signal seeking radio, power <b>windows,</b> and a <b>heater.</b> The Eldorado comprised only [...]5% of Cadillac's sales in 1953.|$|R
50|$|The cabin of the Actros {{is built}} with {{consideration}} for the driver. It provides a silent, smooth and pleasant ride. Pneumatic suspension of both the cab and the tractor itself makes for a really smooth feeling even on the roughest road. The high-roof sleeper version provides two bunks (the upper one not usable while driving, as the seats must be folded). The upper bunk is somewhat wider, but all the controls (radio, <b>windows,</b> auxiliary <b>heater,</b> etc.) {{are available from the}} lower bunk. However, most of the controls one would need (auxiliary heater, sunroof, etc.) while resting are doubled overhead of the driver, and the width of the upper bunk allows for a person to use them by merely stretching their hand.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2016, French {{authorities}} {{opened a}} {{shelter in the}} northeastern part of the camp. Authorities had earlier cleared tents and shacks from this area and erected 125 metal shipping containers in their place, converting the containers into shelters for up to 1,500 migrants. Shipping containers, rather than more permanent structures, were chosen because the sand dunes are unfit for permanent foundations. The container shelters were painted white and were furnished with bunk beds, <b>windows,</b> and <b>heaters,</b> but no running water or sanitary facilities (toilets and showers were made available at an existing nearby facility). At the time, Reuters described the [...] "Jungle" [...] as [...] "squalid" [...] and [...] "unsanitary" [...] and estimated its total population to be 4,000.|$|R
50|$|The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model stands {{among the}} most {{recognized}} thermal comfort models. It was developed using principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady state conditions. The adaptive model, on the other hand, was developed based on hundreds of field studies {{with the idea that}} occupants dynamically interact with their environment. Occupants control their thermal environment by means of clothing, operable <b>windows,</b> fans, personal <b>heaters,</b> and sun shades.|$|R
50|$|The {{collective}} {{reduction in}} national consumption of energy (gas and electricity) is significant for home heating. The Act provided gible financial incentives (tax credits) for average homeowners to make environmentally positive changes to their homes. It made improvements to home energy use more affordable for walls, doors, <b>windows,</b> roofs, water <b>heaters,</b> etc. Consumer spending, {{and hence the}} national economy, was abetted. Industry grew for manufacture of these environmentally positive improvements. These positive improvements have been near and long-term in effect.|$|R

40|$|A {{naturally}} ventilated {{office building}} in Alameda, CA with operable windows and ceiling fans was monitored from Oct 2011 to Oct 2012. Physical environmental parameters such as dry-bulb air temperature, humidity, CO 2 levels, outdoor wind speed, hourly <b>window</b> positions, <b>heater</b> settings and fan settings were recorded. Occupants were surveyed regularly {{over a period of}} one year about their current thermal comfort, thermal acceptability, air movement satisfaction, clothing and noise satisfaction. Occupants wore clothing with a clo value of between 0. 5 – 0. 6 during summer, and 0. 7 – 0. 8 during winter. The clo value of the occupants clothing was most closely correlated with the outdoor running mean temperature. Occupants start opening windows when the outdoor is at 16 °C. Window opening was strongly related with occupant’s arrival and outdoor temperature. Fans use was best explained by indoor temperature. Fans were typically turned on during the summer at indoor temperatures above 26 °C. Occupants voted that the thermal environments in the building were acceptable 98 % of the time during the year-long survey period...|$|R
30|$|Thin {{films of}} {{transparent}} semiconductor have attracted interest {{because of its}} good transparent and conductive properties for the potential applications in electronic fields such as <b>heater</b> <b>windows,</b> dye synthesized solar cells and transparent electrodes [1, 2, 3]. Among the various transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) such as flour tin oxide (FTO), aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) and aluminum tin oxide (ATO), the best known is tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) due to its considerable characteristics of high optical transmittance over the visible spectrum, high conductivity, and chemical stability [4, 5, 6]. Often, 10  mol% of Sn 4 + ions are dissolved into In 2 O 3 lattice to form the ITO solution with maximum conductivity [7].|$|R
50|$|Technical grade sheet mica {{is used in}} {{electrical}} components, electronics, in atomic force microscopy and as window sheets. Other uses include diaphragms for oxygen-breathing equipment, marker dials for navigation compasses, optical filters, pyrometers, thermal regulators, stove and kerosene <b>heater</b> <b>windows,</b> radiation aperture covers for microwave ovens, and micathermic heater elements. Mica is birefringent and is therefore commonly used to make quarter and half wave plates. Specialized applications for sheet mica are found in aerospace components in air-, ground-, and sea-launched missile systems, laser devices, medical electronics and radar systems. Mica is mechanically stable in micrometer-thin sheets which are relatively transparent to radiation (such as alpha particles) while being impervious to most gases. It is therefore used as a window on radiation detectors such as Geiger-Müller tubes.|$|R
40|$|NASA has {{developed}} software that enables American industry {{to establish the}} reliability and life of ceramic structures {{in a wide variety}} of 21 st Century applications. Designing ceramic components to survive at higher temperatures than the capability of most metals and in severe loading environments involves the disciplines of statistics and fracture mechanics. Successful application of advanced ceramics material properties and the use of a probabilistic brittle material design methodology. The NASA program, known as CARES (Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures), is a comprehensive general purpose design tool that predicts the probability of failure of a ceramic component as a function of its time in service. The latest version of this software, CARESALIFE, is coupled to several commercially available finite element analysis programs (ANSYS, MSC/NASTRAN, ABAQUS, COSMOS/N 4, MARC), resulting in an advanced integrated design tool which is adapted to the computing environment of the user. The NASA-developed CARES software has been successfully used by industrial, government, and academic organizations to design and optimize ceramic components for many demanding applications. Industrial sectors impacted by this program include aerospace, automotive, electronic, medical, and energy applications. Dual-use applications include engine components, graphite and ceramic high temperature valves, TV picture tubes, ceramic bearings, electronic chips, glass building panels, infrared <b>windows,</b> radiant <b>heater</b> tubes, heat exchangers, and artificial hips, knee caps, and teeth...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental results of temperature and air velocity field measurements near a glazed façade {{located in a}} test chamber at the Hydro-Quebec (LTE) research laboratory in Shawinigan, Quebec. The façade separates a cold room from a warm room (at normal conditions), both controlled. The objective of the experiment {{was to examine the}} air movement and heat transfer near the windows with and without shading and with different perimeter heating configurations (for winter conditions). The chamber is equipped with three types of heating systems: electrically heated <b>windows,</b> a baseboard <b>heater</b> and a radiant ceiling panel. 2 -D velocity field measurements were performed on a 15 cm× 11 cm vertical plane perpendicular to the window surface using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. A 2 -D motorized traverse system was used to allow measurements at different heights, closer or further away from the façade. The thermal stratification in the room was monitored using a grid of thermocouples at different heights and distances from the facade. The general objective of this work is to develop design recommendations for high performance facades that will reduce or eliminate perimeter heating in buildings as a secondary heating system...|$|R
40|$|The European Integrated Project eCoMove (EU FP 7) aims {{to develop}} {{cooperative}} mobility systems {{and services that}} reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 -emissions with 20 %. The innovations that are developed inside the eCoMove project relate to driving behaviour, trip planning and traffic management & control. As {{one of the first}} steps the inefficiencies that occur in the current system have been identified. Inefficiencies occur both pre-trip, when a trip is being planned as well as on-trip, when the vehicles are driving in the road network. Pre-trip inefficiencies that are target by the eCoMove project are related to: • Vehicle condition: e. g. low tire pressure, heavy (unnecessary) loading, tire condition, vehicle maintenance condition; • Trip planning: e. g. route choice, travel timing, payload (truck-specific). On-trip inefficiencies targeted by eCoMove are related to: • Secondary (driving) tasks: - Vehicle condition & energy consumers: e. g. driving with open <b>windows,</b> using A/C, <b>heaters,</b> other energy consumers; - Inefficient routing: e. g. driving around looking for a parking place, no adjustment of route to traffic situation / road side signals, inefficient lane choice (e. g. causing late merging). • Primary driving tasks: e. g. acceleration / deceleration, gear choice, idling, speed, stops. Each of the use cases and resulting components and applications that are developed in the eCoMove project, targets {{one or more of the}} above mentioned inefficiencies. In this way the inefficiencies are used to keep a clear focus on the project goal of reducing CO 2 -emissions and unnecessary fuel consumption with 20 %...|$|R
30|$|In this study, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) {{thin films}} were {{produced}} by the sol–gel spin-coating technique with an inexpensive salt of indium (In(NO 3) 3 ·H 2 O) and SnCl 4 as indium and tin precursors (the molar ratio of In:Sn was 9 : 1), respectively. Then the prepared thin films were annealed in the temperature of 550  °C under argon atmosphere (the pressure of 10  torr). Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) was used as stabilizers in the synthesis of ITO sol. The prepared ITO thin films were characterized by EDX, XRD, FT-IR, UV–Vis spectroscopy and SEM images. The XRD patterns of the thin films indicated the main peak of the (2 2 2) plane corresponded to indium oxide with high degree of crystallinity. The FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed that indium tin oxide has been prepared by appearance of a peak at 470  cm− 1 that can be assigned to the vibrations of In–O bonds. The optical direct band gap of ITO thin films was calculated about 3.98 – 4.17  eV by optical transmittance measurements. The grain size of ITO nanoparticles was obtained at about 25 – 50  nm by SEM images. The electrical characterization {{was done by the}} four-point probe method to determine the sheet resistance and resistivity. The effects of coating number on ITO thin films properties were investigated. The low resistivity (sheet resistance of 2.5  kΩ/cm 2) and highly transparent films were obtained that can be applied as covers on <b>heater</b> <b>windows.</b> Appearance of a peak at 470  cm− 1 can be assigned to the vibrations of In–O bonds and are characteristic of cubic In 2 O 3.|$|R
