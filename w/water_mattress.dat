50|$|A waterbed, <b>water</b> <b>mattress,</b> or {{flotation}} mattress is a bed or mattress {{filled with}} water. Waterbeds intended for medical therapies appear in various reports through the 19th century.

Currently they account for less than 5% of new bed sales.|$|E
50|$|A primary {{advantage}} of a waterbed is its easy cleaning. It is impossible for dirt and dead skin particles to penetrate the <b>water</b> <b>mattress,</b> which can then be wiped periodically with a cloth and vinyl cleaner. The cover over the mattress can be regularly washed—thus virtually eliminating house dust mites in the bed. Dust mites can trigger asthma, eczema, and allergies in people sensitive to them.|$|E

40|$|Background: Maintaining normothermia during porcine {{surgery is}} {{critical}} in ensuring subject welfare and recovery, {{reducing the risk of}} immune system compromise and surgical-site infection that can result from hypothermia. In humans, various methods of patient heating have been demonstrated to be useful, but less evaluation has been performed in techniques to prevent hypothermia perioperatively in pigs. Methods: We compared body temperature regulation during surgery before and after modification of the ambient temperature of the operating laboratories. Three different methods of heating were then compared; a standard circulating <b>water</b> <b>mattress,</b> a resistive fabric blanket, and a forced hot air system. The primary measure was percentage of temperature readings outside a specification range of 36. 7 – 40. 0 °C. Results: Tighter control of the ambient temperature while using a circulating <b>water</b> <b>mattress</b> reduced the occurrence of out-of-specification body temperature readings from 20. 8 % to 5. 0 %, with most of these the result of hypothermia. Use of a resistive fabric blanket further reduced out-of-specification readings to 1. 5 %, with a slight increase in the occurrence of hyperthermia. Use of a forced air system reduced out-of-specification readings to less 0. 1 %. Conclusions: Maintenance of normothermia perioperatively in pig can be improved by tightly controlling ambient temperatures. Use of a resistive blanket or a forced air system can lead to better control than a circulating <b>water</b> <b>mattress,</b> with the forced air system providing a faster response to temperature variations and less chance of hyperthermia...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} patients undergoing cardiac surgery with hypothermic bypass {{to see if}} the addition of skin surface warming during systemic rewarming on bypass (heated group, n = 43) would improve perioperative thermal balance compared with conventional management without skin warming (control group, n = 43) in an open, randomized, controlled study. Intraoperative skin warming with a <b>water</b> <b>mattress</b> and forced warm air over the face, neck and shoulders attenuated the afterdrop in nasopharyngeal temperature after weaning from bypass (2. 3 (1. 2) degrees C and 1. 3 (0. 5) degrees C in the control and heated groups, respectively) (P < 0. 05) and resulted in higher rectal temperature 4 h after surgery. Despite similar standard coagulation tests, heated patients had lower blood loss via the chest tubes (600 (264) ml vs 956 (448) ml in control patients) (P < 0. 05) and less requirements for i. v. colloid infusion (1662 (404) ml vs 1994 (389) ml) (P < 0. 05). There was a significant inverse correlation between rectal temperature on arrival in the ICU and postoperative blood loss (r = 0. 57, P < 0. 001).

40|$|SUMMARY Seventeen healthy preterm babies had extra warmth {{provided}} in their cots by thermocontrolled, heated, <b>water</b> filled <b>mattresses.</b> As controls 17 babies {{of the same}} weight were nursed in air heated incubators.

The babies were kept just as warm on the heated, <b>water</b> filled <b>mattresses</b> as in air heated incubators but the mattresses had the advantage of giving the mothers easy access to their babies. Air heated incubators and thermocontrolled radiant heaters are most often used to warm preterm babies in modem neonatal care units. Both techniques are complex, expensive, and require a continuous electrical supply. These techniques are, therefore, not suitable for use in most developing countries.

5000|$|The {{practical}} drawbacks {{are more}} numerous. First, since some hard-sided waterbeds are {{of different sizes}} than other mattresses, bed sheets are harder to find and come in fewer varieties. Soft-sided mattresses are conventionally sized to avoid this problem. Second, moving a waterbed is a more difficult process than moving a normal bed; the water must be drained and the frame disassembled, then the frame must be reassembled, the <b>mattress</b> refilled with <b>water,</b> and the water heated for a potentially long period to get the new water to the correct temperature. And heating the bed can be costly: a waterbed consumes between 300 and 1500 kW·h/year, depending on the climate, bed size, and other factors. The energy usage can be decreased by about 60% {{with the use of}} a soft-sided waterbed. The water itself can pose challenges: occasionally, <b>water</b> <b>mattresses</b> may leak. Plastic liners will reduce damage, but emptying, patching, refilling, and reheating it (and sleeping elsewhere until all this is completed) is an inconvenience.|$|R
30|$|Mattresses are {{classified}} by {{the type of}} support system: innerspring, solid foam, cotton batting, air, or water. Air and <b>water</b> <b>mattresses</b> account for less than 20 % of the U.S. market, solid foam (viscoelastic and latex) mattresses and innerspring mattresses account for nearly all of the remaining 80 % of the U.S. market (Mattress manufacturing in the US [2011]). Solid foam mattresses, also called all-foam mattress, do not have springs or other metallic arrangements. The use of viscoelastic or ‘memory’ foam and latex mattress is increasing in modern residential mattresses. An innerspring mattress is constructed from metal springs that may be separately housed in individual fabric sheaths or attached to a metal frame (Figure 4 a). Innerspring mattresses covered with varying combinations of layered viscoelastic and latex foam in combination with standard PUF are also available. For single-sided mattresses (also known as ‘no flip’ mattresses), the innerspring is covered by a comfort layer {{on one side and a}} low-cost non-woven backing material on the other. A comfort layer covers both sides for double-sided mattresses.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Mild {{hypothermia}} {{has been}} suggested to be protective against tissue ischemia during aortic operations. However, recent studies have documented detrimental cardiac effects of hypothermia during a variety of operative procedures. The influence of different warming methods {{and the impact of}} hypothermia during standard aortic procedures was assessed. Methods: One hundred patients who underwent repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms or aortoiliac occlusive disease were prospectively randomized into 2 groups, receiving either a circulating <b>water</b> <b>mattress</b> or a forced air warming blanket. Adjuvant warming methods were standardized. The day before surgery, 48 -hour Holter monitors were applied and interpreted by a cardiologist blinded to the treatment. Randomization resulted in equivalent groups with regard to patient history, indications for surgery, body mass index, length of surgery, and fluid requirements. Results: Core temperatures were significantly warmer during surgery (36. 3 °C ± 0. 7 °C vs 35. 4 ± 0. 8 °C) and after surgery (36. 4 °C ± 0. 7 °C vs 35. 6 °C ± 0. 9 °C) in patients with forced air warming (P <. 001). The circulating <b>water</b> <b>mattress</b> group had significantly more metabolic acidosis perioperatively (P =. 03). Postoperative length of stay, cardiac complications, and death rates were not significantly different. Subgroup analysis of 83 aneurysm patients comparing normothermia with hypothermia (temperature less than 36 °C) on arrival to the recovery room identified decreased cardiac output (P =. 02), thrombocytopenia (P =. 02), elevated prothrombin time (P =. 04), and inferior Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores (P <. 001) in the hypothermic group. Holter analysis revealed more sinus tachycardia (ST) segment changes and ventricular tachycardia in hypothermic aneurysm patients (P =. 05). Conclusion: Patients treated with forced air blankets had significantly less metabolic acidosis and were kept significantly warmer than those treated with circulating water mattresses. Patients with aneurysms that were kept normothermic had a significantly improved clinical profile, with fewer cardiac events on the Holter recordings. We therefore conclude that (1) normothermia is protective for infrarenal aortic surgical patients; and (2) forced air warming blankets provide improved temperature maintenance compared with circulating water mattresses.

40|$|A core {{temperature}} drop after cardiac surgery slows down the patient's recuperation process. In {{order to minimize}} {{the amount of the}} so-called afterdrop, more knowledge is needed about the impaired thermoregulatory system during anesthesia and the effect of different protocols on temperature distribution. Therefore, a computer model has been developed that describes heat transfer during cardiac surgery. The model consists of three parts: (1) a passive part, which gives a simplified description of the human geometry and the passive heat transfer processes, (2) an active part that takes into account the thermoregulatory system {{as a function of the}} amount of anesthesia and (3) submodels, through which it is possible to adjust the boundary conditions. The validity of the new model was tested by comparing the model results to the measurement results of three surgical procedures. A good resemblance was found between simulation results and the experiments. Next, a model application was shown.

Two 14 -sensor thermocouple thermometry probes were placed in catheters to monitor the invasive temperature. Results: Phantom measurements showed sufficient penetration depth up to 10 cm depth. The combination of 300 - 900 W antenna power and a water temperature of 42 degrees C was well tolerated for the entire session of 1 h and resulted in good tumor temperatures with T 90 = 39. 8 degrees C, T 50 = 41. 1 degrees C, and T 10 = 42. 2 degrees C.

40|$|Pancuronium bromide {{was used}} safely as the muscle relaxant for {{neonatal}} anaesthesia. No untoward effects were seen and the neuromuscular block was successfully reversed in all patients. The potency ratio of pancuronium {{as compared with}} tubocurarine ranged from 9 : 1 at birth to 6 : 1 at one month of age. The newborn is increasingly subjected to major surgical procedures, and the anaesthetic techniques used commonly involve muscle relaxants. This study was performed to determine if pancuronium bromide is suitable for use in anaesthesia at this age, and to attempt to establish an index of dose and potency for this drug. METHOD All the surgical procedures were upon the abdomen. Thus muscle relaxation and apnoea could be better judged and the patients ' general condition was less complicated than in those with cardiac, thoracic, or neurosurgical conditions. Twenty-five patients were studied. All were under 28 days of age {{at the time of}} the procedure. Pancuronium was given in a strength of 100 ^g/ml.

40|$|Inadvertent {{hypothermia}} {{is common}} in patient's undergoing surgical procedures. Hypothermia within the perioperative environment may have many undesired physiological effects {{that are associated with}} significant postoperative morbidity. Patient's temperature drops to below 35 °C during the first hour of anaesthesia because of impaired thermoregulatory mechanism and patient getting cold in the operating theatre. For this reason, health care professionals working in the perioperative environment need to know what are the most effective strategies for treating or preventing hypothermia to improving patient outcomes following surgical procedures. However, to date there has been no systematic review of effectiveness with high quality randomised controlled trials to identify effective strategies for the prevention and/or management of hypothermia in the perioperative environment. The objective of this systematic review was to identify the most effective strategies for the prevention and/or management of hypothermia in the intraoperative and postoperative phases of surgical care. A comprehensive search was undertaken on electronic databases from their inception to October 2008, including Cochrane library, MEDLINE, PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Current contents connect, DARE, Dissertations Abstract International, EMBASE, Scopus, and TRIP. The search was restricted to English language. Randomised controlled trials or clinical controlled trials were sought, which evaluated the effectiveness of active or passive warming techniques in the prevention and/or treatment of inadvertent hypothermia. Critical appraisal of study quality was undertaken using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal instruments. Data extraction was via the Joanna Briggs Institute standard data extraction form for evidence of effectiveness. Eighteen studies with a combined 1451 patients were included. The results were classified into three categories with a further sub classification within the active warming techniques category. Forced air warming was effective in maintaining intraoperative normothermia when compared to passive warming, routine thermal care and no form of warming. Forced air warming in pregnant women scheduled for caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia prevented maternal and foetal hypothermia. In contrast, passive warming with tight elastic bandages wrapped around the legs (passive insulation) in the same patient population had no significant benefits in preventing maternal hypothermia. However, in arthroscopic knee surgery patients, forced air warming did not result in a decrease in the incidence of postoperative shivering indicating that it was not effective or feasible to extend active warming into recovery in this patient population. Forced air warming was effective than circulating <b>water</b> <b>mattress</b> in preventing hypothermia in patients who underwent repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Forced air warming was effective against radiant warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in lengthier surgical procedures. Prewarming in different patient populations prevents redistribution hypothermia, especially after one hour of anaesthesia induction. Intravenous and irrigating fluids warmed (38 - 40 °C) to a temperature higher than that of room temperature by different fluid warming devices (both dry and water heated) proved significantly beneficial to patients in terms of stable haemodynamic variables, and higher core temperature (core T) {{at the end of the}} surgery (transurethral prostatectomy and orthopaedic surgery). However, prewarming irrigation fluids in knee arthroscopy patients did not prove beneficial in maintaining normothermia. Water garment warmer was significantly (P < 0. 05) effective than forced air warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in orthotopic liver transplantation patients. Extra warming with forced air compared to routine thermal care was effective in reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections and postoperative cardiac complications, as well as shorten the length of hospital stay. Passive warming with reflective heating blankets or elastic bandages wrapped around the legs tightly were found to be ineffective in reducing the incidence or magnitude of hypothermia. Low-flow anaesthesia with active forced air warming was effective in stabilising patient's core T during surgical procedures when compared to low-flow anaesthesia alone or low-flow anaesthesia with passive insulation. Phenylephrine i. v. infusion resulted in a significantly less reduction in core T after first hour of anaesthesia and patients were warmer until the end of the surgery (minor oral surgery). Active warming with forced air warming units keeps all patients warmer in the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Forced air warming compared with alternate forms of warming reduces the incidence of shivering and wound infections, increases thermal comfort and reduces morbid cardiac events. Our review indicates that active warming techniques (forced-air warming) are effective in preventing and managing hypothermia in the perioperative environment and based on the results from the review there are several recommendations to guide clinical practice: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future research should focus on large, high quality randomised controlled trials looking at long-term clinical outcomes, operating temperature forced-air warming devices (not just maximum set temperature), different body sites and percentage of body coverage area of active warming for efficient management of intraoperative hypothermia.
