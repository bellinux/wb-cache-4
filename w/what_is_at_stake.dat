5|$|The main character, Gabriel Belmont (voiced by Robert Carlyle), is {{a member}} of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend {{innocent}} people against the supernatural creatures. Gabriel's wife Marie (Natascha McElhone) was brutally murdered by one of them, and her soul cannot leave as it is trapped in limbo. Because she is now neither alive nor dead, she realizes <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> and guides Gabriel to his destiny to save the world as he investigates the dark spell. He travels the destroyed land, meeting other characters, such as the oldest living member of his order, Zobek (Patrick Stewart, who additionally narrates the game). Two masks referred to as the God and Devil Masks lie at the center of the plot, with the God Mask having powers to resurrect the dead. Gabriel intends to defeat the three factions of the Lords of Shadow in order to obtain the pieces of the God Mask and bring back his deceased wife.|$|E

500|$|In 1918, Walter A. Briscoe and H. Russell Stannard {{released}} a seminal biography, Captain Ball VC, reprinting many of Ball's letters and prefaced with encomiums by Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard. Lloyd George wrote that [...] "What {{he says in}} one of his letters, 'I hate this game, but it is the only thing one must do just now', represents, I believe, the conviction of those vast armies who, realising <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved". Haig spoke of Ball's [...] "unrivalled courage" [...] and his [...] "example and incentive to those who have taken up his work". [...] In Trenchard's opinion, Ball had [...] "a wonderfully well-balanced brain, and his loss to the Flying Corps was the greatest loss it could sustain at that time".|$|E
500|$|The {{applicant}} has {{the initial}} burden of showing {{that he or}} she has a prima facie case that should be considered by the Court. Once this has been done, it is for the executive to justify the legality of the detention. One commentator has said that the applicant's task is to discharge his or her evidential burden, following which the public authority detaining the applicant has a legal burden of showing that the detention is lawful.

500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan on {{his website}} [...] "Jammer's Reviews", {{thought that the}} episode's story bore {{similarities}} to the [...] episode [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] due to the alternative timeline and also the film Memento due to the memory issues suffered by Archer. Epsicokhan also suggested that the flashback sequences were similar to the [...] episode [...] "", but was a [...] "substantially less poignant take on hypothetical material". He said that the episode had [...] "something for everyone", with an [...] "apocalyptic" [...] action storyline which tied in neatly to an interesting character drama. He gave the episode a score of {{three and a half}} out of four. The review on Ain't It Cool News also suggested that the storyline had been inspired by a number of different episodes in the Star Trek franchise, including the Voyager episodes [...] "Year of Hell" [...] and [...] "", as well as The Next Generation [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] and [...] "". But the reviewer thought that the episode presented the viewer with a sense of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> with the fight against the Xindi for the first time, and gave the episode a score of four out of five, a grade described as [...] "better than most motion pictures".|$|E

5000|$|A {{case that}} contributed to the court's opinion was Griffin v. Illinois, [...] Before that case, only convicted felons sentenced to death had access to an appellate review if they were unable to pay for transcripts. The court then decided that all {{criminal}} cases, even noncapital ones, would be allowed the same right, in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment. The other largely-influential case was Mayer v. Chicago, , which decided that any offence, even [...] "quasi-criminal" [...] ones in nature, may be appealed, regardless of financial means. M.L.B. argued that <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> for her <b>was</b> far greater than <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> for a [...] "quasi-criminal" [...] and that her right to appeal should in no way be determined by her wallet. The court made their ruling based on that argument and reversed the one made by the Mississippi Supreme Court.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{viewpoint}} on sex education, historically {{inspired by}} sexologists like Wilhelm Reich and psychologists like Sigmund Freud and James W. Prescott, holds that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in sex education is {{control over the}} body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual mores. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized sexual oppression and {{to make up their}} own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of [...] "Reid About Sex" [...] suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.|$|E

2500|$|Appiah {{credited}} Stein {{with helping}} {{to clarify the}} issues surrounding social constructionism, but argued that, because of his avoidance of some technical philosophical issues, Stein {{failed to make the}} strongest possible case against some forms of [...] "essentialism". He complimented Stein for his discussion of early scientific research on sexual orientation, as well as his criticism of more recent work by scientists such as LeVay, Dean Hamer, and Daryl Bem. He wrote that Stein clarified the debate over the relevance of choice to sexual orientation, and considered Stein's [...] "notion of nondeterminism" [...] to be one of his most original contributions. He endorsed Stein's view that the science of sexual orientation is not relevant to debates on gay rights, but was less convinced by Stein's arguments that future technologies that might make it possible to determine a child's sexual orientation would encouraged prejudice and thus be unethical. He welcomed Stein's contribution to the debate over the morality of conducting scientific research on sexual orientation, and concluded that his was [...] "a rich and rewarding work that should be read by anyone who wants to think about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in the scientific exploration of sexual orientation." ...|$|E

One conclusion, however, was indubitable: life must be religion; when we consider <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> and that our eternal welfare depends on our due preparation for the future, it was folly to spare a single hour from the consideration of the best means to secure our readiness. Such a subject does not admit of half measures or of halting opinions.
