5000|$|Then events {{took what}} Lord Hoffman {{described}} in his judgment as [...] "an unusual turn". [...] The Irish government agency in whom the judgment debt was vested (Forfás) assigned the judgment debt to Nam Tai. Accordingly, Nam Tai became a creditor {{of its main}} shareholder, Tele-Art Inc. Nam Tai then issued <b>winding-up</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the British Virgin Islands courts against Tele-Art Inc. and on 17 July 1998 the court made a winding-up order, and Mr David Hague, {{a partner in the}} Hong Kong office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, was appointed as the liquidator.

50|$|The Company {{initiated}} <b>winding-up</b> <b>proceedings</b> in 1888, and was reincorporated by {{letters patent}} in Ontario as the Canadian Land and Immigration Company of Haliburton Limited in 1889. From 1890 to 1897 little activity took place. Sales {{of land and}} timber cutting rights had practically ceased. In 1895, Irwin declared bankruptcy and the bank (most likely the Canadian Bank of Commerce) took possession of his rights and interests in Haliburton, which included his shares in the new Company. In 1922, the Company sold Bruton Township to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario for $225,000, and proceeds from the sale allowed the Company to buy back from the bank the timber cutting rights previously licensed to Irwin. In 1933, the Company sold Clyde Township back to the Province for $25,000.|$|E
50|$|Another new {{repayment}} restriction under consideration, is {{that the}} Icelandic government on 1 October 2013 presented a proposal for their 2014 budget law, to include a new 0.145% tax on all transfers from estates of failed financial companies. Some lawyers however have the opinion, {{that this kind of}} tax on failed companies could be seen as an illegal expropriation by the Icelandic state. If the Icelandic government passes this proposed law, it will almost with certainty become challenged in a lawsuit by the receivership estates behind the three failed Icelandic banks. The Kaupthing estate has released a statement pointing out they consider the proposal to be illegal, due to both infringement of private property (expropriation) and because its illegal retroactively to introduce a new tax claim with a higher creditor priority than the already filed claims towards the estates in <b>winding-up</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 2016-17 {{season is}} Ergotelis 1st {{season in the}} Gamma Ethniki, the third tier of the Greek {{football}} league system, after 14 years in which the club competed in professional competitions. Ergotelis also participates in the Gamma Ethniki Cup, a football competition cup in which only the clubs competing {{in one of the}} four groups of the Gamma Ethniki can participate. The season marks {{the beginning of a new}} era in the clubs history, as the previous Football Club opened <b>winding-up</b> <b>proceedings</b> entering into liquidation, a process that allowed the parent sport club G.S. Ergotelis to form a new football department eligible to compete in the Gamma Ethniki under new leadership, free of the financial obligations of the previous administration. The club slogan for the season Ksekiname! (Ξεκινάμε!) literally translates to We begin!. The project was successful, as Ergotelis finished as Champions of Group 4, achieving instant promotion to the Football League, and professional divisions in general.|$|E
50|$|According to the Landsbanki Receiverships initial {{interpretation}} of the Icelandic law, the creditor claims in foreign currency towards a liquidated Icelandic financial company in receivership, should only be repaid by an ISK-equivalent amount as per the currency exchange rate registered on the date when <b>winding-up</b> <b>proceedings</b> were initiated; which was as per 22 April 2009 for the Landsbanki receivership. Moreover, it was believed the creditors had no legal right to claim compensation towards the Landsbanki receivership for any potential losses they may suffer, because of exchange rate fluctuations after 22 April 2009. On 26 September 2013, the Icelandic Supreme Court however ruled against this initial law {{interpretation of}} the Landsbanki Receivership, concluding all creditors should be fully repaid with currency amounts equal to the denoted local currency of their claim; meaning that when repaid with other currencies, then valuation of this amount should be calculated by converting it to the claims denoted currency, according to the foreign currency exchange rates registered by the Icelandic Central Bank on the repayment date. Thus ensuring that all creditors bare no currency exchange risks, with these risks -and potential financial burdens- instead to be upheld solely by the receivership.|$|E
50|$|After its {{withdrawal}} from professional competitions, the football department of Ergotelis reinstated its amateur status, thus merging with the parent multi-sport club, Gymnastics Club Ergotelis. The latter's officials {{decided that the}} Football Club should thus be dissolved and enter into liquidation, a process that would allow Ergotelis to compete in amateur competitions under new leadership, free of the financial obligations of the previous administration. The decision was fiercely rivaled by major shareholder Papoutsakis, who instead opted for liquidation without dismantling the company, in operation under {{the provisions of the}} bankruptcy code. After the Gymnastics Club's administration reached out on the matter to the Deputy Minister for Sport Stavros Kontonis, joined by fellow Football League withdrawn competitors Olympiakos Volou, elections were held in April 2016 appointing Georgios Vrentzos as the new president of the Gymnastics Club, and head of all its football departments. After the Hellenic Football Federation, the Greek Professional Sports Commission and the Greek Ministry of Development all ruled in favor of the Gymnastics Club case and reassured its officials that the club would compete in the Gamma Ethniki, the third tier of the Greek football league system, the club's new administration was free to open up <b>winding-up</b> <b>proceedings</b> and appoint liquidators, {{while at the same time}} rebuilding the football department and attempt a swift return to professional competitions. As the club brought in former Ergotelis stars such as Sergio Leal and Nikolaos Katsikokeris to lead the effort on the pitch and filled the roster with veteran Football League players, the new administration's project eventually paid off. Ergotelis finished at the top of the 2016-17 Gamma Ethniki Group 4 Table, thus managing instant promotion back to pro-level competitions. After celebrations on securing the Division title ended, club president Vrentzos announced he could no longer financially support the football club on his own and that he had initiated talks with external parties to secure the required funds to form a new Ergotelis professional Football Club department, eligible to compete in the Football League. Eventually, after a full week of negotiations during the end of July 2017, and with Georgios Vrentzos set to retire, the club's General Assembly agreed to transfer the ownership of Ergotelis' professional football department to Egyptian businessman Maged Samy, owner of Egyptian Premier League club Wadi Degla and Belgian B Division side Lierse S.K..|$|E

40|$|The {{problem in}} PricewaterhouseCoopers v Saad Investments Co Ltd 2014 UKPC 35 (10 November 2014), 2014 1 WLR 4482 (PC) {{was that the}} Cayman liquidators, {{frustrated}} by the unhelpfulness of the company's previous auditors in supplying documents and information to help the liquidators {{get to the bottom}} of the company's problems, then obtained a winding-up order in Bermuda, the auditors' home jurisdiction, to have them examined. The auditors appealed successfully to the Privy Council in London to have the winding-up stayed. The facts and the reasoning of this senior court are described, and then critically discussed in this case comment. The auditors were erroneously added to the statutory list of persons who may apply to the court for the stay of the <b>winding-up</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Still, the decision may be supported for the finding that, on the particular facts of the case, the auditors had standing to challenge the winding-up application because the Bermudian court of first instance had no jurisdiction under the relevant statutes and the auditors were the direct targets of the application to wind up the company and examine them. The outcome of the decision carries important implications for the development of company law in England and Bermuda, and for the corresponding company law in South Africa, where the decision is of persuasive authority...|$|E
