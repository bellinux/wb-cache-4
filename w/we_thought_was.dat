25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
500|$|Governor Henry Bellmon {{opposed the}} Chickasaw Turnpike, arguing {{it would be}} a money loser. Bellmon had the turnpike built with only two lanes and {{shortened}} it to its current termini. Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr., an OTA board member (and future mayor of Tulsa), was later quoted as saying [...] "I think it stinks. We never wanted to build it. It was not anything <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> appropriate. But in order to build the three turnpikes that were necessary, that is the only way they would build it." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker said {{following}} the tremendous success of [...] "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", {{much of the}} direct feedback he received for [...] "Damien" [...] was negative. Parker described it as the [...] "first sort of backlash" [...] he had experienced with South Park, with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had [...] "sold out". Parker said, [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?' We just kept doing what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> funny, we didn't go start making commercials or anything. But everybody was saying we sold out." [...] Nevertheless, the episode received generally positive reviews, and {{has been described as}} one of South Park [...] "classic episodes".|$|E

"To be frank, I {{was really}} surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{creating}} the quintessential American show. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> the Muppets <b>were</b> quintessentially American, {{and it turns}} out they're the most international characters ever created."

500|$|In 1997, the Strokes {{consisted}} of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet {{to the music}} of reggae artist Bob Marley, protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, [...] "Our music was, like, , but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when we put them together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> really cool." [...] In 1998, Albert Hammond, Jr., who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art, {{photographed by}} Ament, {{features}} two skeletons wearing crowns, suggesting {{the possibility that}} the two represent a king and a queen. The forged metal figurines were created by blacksmith Kelly Gilliam. According to Ament, the band had trouble coming up with a name for the album. After the artwork had been finalized and the tracks were sequenced, the band spent weeks {{trying to come up with}} a title. Vedder suggested Riot Act, and the band members went with it as they were tired with trying to come up with a title. McCready stated that the title has no real significance. He said, [...] "I guess we were trying to come up with a title that reflected some of the music on the record, which <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> urgent-sounding and kind of loud...It just seemed to fit." [...] Ament implied that the title has to do with [...] "getting your act together." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let us know that it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up with what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Friedkin {{elaborated}} on {{this theme}} {{in an interview}} with Thomas D. Clagett: [...] In the director's opinion, the premise of The Wages of Fear (both the novel and the first film adaptation) seemed to him a metaphor for [...] "the world [...] full of strangers who hated one another, but if they didn't cooperate, if they didn't work together in some way, they would blow up." [...] Walon Green, the screenwriter, said that he and Friedkin [...] "wanted a cynical movie where fate turns the corner for the people before they turn it themselves". Additionally, their intention was to [...] "write a real movie about what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the reality of Latin America and the presence of foreigners there today".|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the band}} name, Brett {{said in an}} interview: [...] "It's {{just kind of a}} stupid name. We used to have this really obnoxious drummer, and he used to call me 'Handsome', that was his {{nickname}} for me, I think for sarcastic reasons... And he wanted to call it the Handsome Family... and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> funny, too. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> a good name." ...|$|R
60|$|If we {{had eaten}} little at breakfast we could eat still less at dinner. After dinner the clouds rolled away, {{and the sun}} came joyously and gloriously out. This, <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>was</b> a good omen. Felicity opined that it wouldn't have cleared up {{if it was the}} Judgment Day. Nevertheless, we dressed {{ourselves}} carefully, and the girls put on their white dresses.|$|E
60|$|The Enemy had answer'd our Fire {{with all}} the Ardour imaginable; and having made a Breach, that, as <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> practicable, a Storm was {{expected}} every Hour.

"All <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was,</b> {{that for}} us old ancient singers to be choked off quiet at no time in particular, as now, in the Sundays after Easter, would seem rather mean {{in the eyes of}} other parishes, sir.

60|$|Walking tourists, we supposed, {{though one}} <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a clergyman; and on Sunday {{we saw him}} in the desk and the {{draughtsman}} in the parsonage pew; and we discovered that these were the proposed new curate, Mr. Cradock, and his younger brother. Our rector was a canon who had bad health and never came near us, and the poor old curate was past work, and, indeed, died a week or two after he had given up.|$|E
60|$|When we returned, Pomona saw us drive in,--she had {{not known}} of our ride,--and {{when she heard the}} news she was as wild with proud delight as anybody.

[...] "I never can enter into the taste the others have for that style of thing; but Bobus might have succeeded.

30|$|In {{the current}} study, {{we used the}} staged {{approach}} in AVMs with multiple feeders. Despite {{that the value of}} this approach <b>was</b> debated, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> associated with less hemorrhagic complications (Mounayer et al. 2007). This approach allowed smooth normalization of hemodynamics and prevented extensive venous thrombosis. The use of NBCA (glue) was limited to high flow fistulas in 4 patients (19.0 %), where <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> more simple and effective method.|$|R

"Troth, it's my belaif that there's no pass at all," [...] said Larry, {{somewhat}} doggedly, as {{he shifted}} about uneasily in the saddle; [...] "haven't we bin comin' up to places all day that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the pass,--but they wasn't; I don't think Mister Arryhairo knows it hisself, and this baist of a mule has blistered my hands an' a'most broke my arms with baitin' of it--not to mintion other parts o' me body.

60|$|After {{considerable}} difficulty we gained what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> our cave, only to {{find that}} it was not, and then we realized that we were lost in the labyrinthine mazes of the great cavern. We retraced our steps and sought the point from which we had started, but only succeeded in losing ourselves the more. Ajor was aghast--not so much from fear of our predicament; but that she should have failed in the functioning of that wonderful sense she possessed in common with most other creatures Caspakian, which makes it possible for them to move unerringly from place to place without compass or guide.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is exactly}} what I told you, Carrie. We {{anchored}} close to a craft that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a merchantman, and that we meant to attack in our boats. I swam on board her in the dark--to {{see if they were}} keeping a good watch, and that sort of thing--and when I got on board, I found she was a ship of war, with a lot of heavy guns, and prepared to take us by surprise when we attacked her; so of course, when I swam back again with the news, Captain Lockett cut his cable and towed the brig out in the dark.|$|E
