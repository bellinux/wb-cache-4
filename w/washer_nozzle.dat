40|$|This master thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a refilling position and solution, for washer fluid. As well as a study and development of the use of a secondary washer fluid for winter and summer use. The focus of this work, however, has been {{on the development of the}} regular washer fluid with regards to creating a user-friendly ergonomic solution with a premium feel, that improves the user experience and simplifies the refilling process for the user. The automotive industry today is constantly evolving and always strive to improve their products in most areas when it comes to the environment and their clients, etc. Despite this, the process of refilling washer fluid has not been developed in the modern automotive history. The refilling of washer fluid today, looks the same as it ”always” has done. This takes place under hood in a small dirty compartment, with a relatively small tube opening where the user must aim the washer fluid when pouring. To get there, the user must carry out several unnecessary steps to get under the bonnet, where the user does not necessarily have anything to do. This, even though other areas around the washer fluid has evolved a lot, in terms of wiper blades and <b>washer</b> fluid <b>nozzles.</b> The work is done with Volvo Cars Cooperation as clients. Volvo Cars is a Swedish car manufacturer that manufactures passenger cars, which they have done since 1927, when the company started. They are aiming to become the world’s most modern and attractive premium car brand, a leader in innovation and people-centered development. They strive to make the life easier and more enjoyable for their users. Since Volvo has the intention to always improve their products to their users and make life easier for them, this project has used a human-centered design process. The work was done together with the demands and requests from the involved departments at Volvo Cars as well as customer surveys and interviews with mechanics. To find a solution that satisfies all stakeholders and Standards it required an iterative approach and design work.   The work resulted in two concepts where both ordinary and secondary washer fluid can be filled, these prototypes were made and built into a Volvo XC 60, 3 D renderings of these, as well as an interface for the secondary washer fluid. These solutions have made the process of refilling washer easier with less steps for the and gives a feeling of a premium and innovative solution...|$|R
