40|$|Love Song is {{an essay}} about romance, passion, obsession, attraction, Eros, intoxication, infatuation, {{to fall in}} love and love. Love songs, as artworks, are almost always {{directed}} towards a nameless “you” and this essay <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The text might be seen as a way to create and rewrite something, a performance to understand other performances, a dwelling on past relationships, a love letter, or just a text for me to vent you with others that have been thinking about you. I would love to hear Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Chris Kraus, Beyoncé, Bell Hooks, Anaïs Nin and Taylor Swift talk to each other about art and romances, but because that is an impossible dream I try to connect them and many other thinkers, artists and singers through language. One of them, Roland Barthes once wrote: "Language is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had worlds instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my worlds. "[1] Love Song is, more than anything else an attempted to touch you, a strategy to better understand the way you made and make me feel.   [1] Roland Barthes, A Lover’s Discourse – Fragments, original: Fragments d’un discours amoureux, 1977, translation from French: Richard Howard, Edition du Seuil, 1978, p. 73. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction It {{has been}} argued that existential {{sentences}} only introduce foci (1 a), not topics (1 b) (Francez 2007; Bentley 2012 / 2013; Cruschina 2015). They can therefore be seen as focus-marking devices (Besserman et al. 2015). (1) 	a. There’s a white cat in the garden. (Cruschina 2012) 	b. – ‘Where’s my sister?’ 	– # B’est sorre tua in coghina. 	 # ‘There’s your sister in the kitchen. ’ (Bentley 2012) It/c’èst clefts can introduce both foci and topics (Prince 1978; Dufter 2009), whereas existential clefts introduced by French ya / Italian c’è ‘there is’ (2) are argued to introduce foci only (Lambrecht 1994), but this has not yet been verified. (2) 	a. Ya le téléphone qui sonne. 	‘The phone is ringing. ’ (Lambrecht 2000) 	b. C’è un signore che vuole parlare con te. 	‘There’s a man who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> ’ (Marzo & Crocco 2015) Goal The first goal {{of this study is to}} verify whether existential clefts only introduce foci by analyzing over 600 clefts from four (French and Italian) corpora. The second goal is to compare the information structure potential of existential sentences and existential clefts. Results It turns out that ya clefts and c’è clefts express three different articulations, in which the clefted element is never topical: all-focus (2), focus-background (3 a) and doubly contrastive all-focus (3 b), in which the clefted element and the relative clause are contrasted with the previous context. (3) 	a. (– ‘What’s your favorite TV show?’) - "How I Met Your Mother" c'est génial, y'a aussi "Lost" qui est bien. 	- ‘HIMYM is great, there’s also Lost that’s good. ’ b. Ci sono ragazze che hanno tutte le illustrazioni eppoi ci sono io che ne ho tipo 8. ‘There are girls who have all the illustrations and then there’s me who only has like 8. ’ Secondly, existential sentences can express the same articulations, the only difference being that the information denoted by the relative clause in clefts is encoded differently in existentials, e. g. as a (pre/postposed) PP in all-focus (1 a) and focus-background existential sentences (4 a) or as a new sentence (you have…) in a double contrast all-focus existential sentence (4 b). (4) 	a. (Among the decisions taken by the EU that you can easily observe,) il y a par exemple la création de l'Euro. 	‘… there is for example the creation of the Euro. ’ 	b. She said there were people struggling for their lives and then there's you [...] you have all these opportunities and you're throwing it all away. The more general conclusion is therefore that existential sentences and existential clefts display considerable similarities and that ya and c’è can be seen as focus markers, regardless of whether they introduce an existential sentence or a cleft.
