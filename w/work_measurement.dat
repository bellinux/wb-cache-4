25|$|Charles Eugène Bedaux (10 October 1886 – 18 February 1944) was a French-born American millionaire {{who made}} his fortune {{developing}} and implementing the <b>work</b> <b>measurement</b> aspect of scientific management, notably the Bedaux System.

40|$|We derive {{analytical}} expressions for {{the bias}} of the Jarzynski free-energy estimator from N nonequilibrium <b>work</b> <b>measurements,</b> for a generic work distribution. To achieve this, we map the estimator onto the Random Energy Model in a suitable scaling limit parametrized by (log N) /m, where m measures {{the width of}} the lower tail of the work distribution, and then compute the finite-N corrections to this limit with different approaches for different regimes of (log N) /m. We show that these expressions describe accurately the bias for a wide class of work distributions, and exploit them to build an improved free-energy estimator from unidirectional <b>work</b> <b>measurements.</b> We apply the method to optical tweezers unfolding/refolding experiments on DNA hairpins of varying loop size and dissipation, displaying both near-Gaussian and non-Gaussian work distributions.
