Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient Vinho Verde winemaking region, and there is commercial wine production, however local masseira wines are not commercially produced. The inland valley region is committed to milk production and the Agros corporation headquarters of Lactogal, the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula, is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories. In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a <b>windbreak</b> against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the central depression.|$|E

In agricultural landscapes we find them as farmstead <b>windbreaks,</b> livestock <b>windbreaks</b> and field <b>windbreaks.</b> While farmstead and livestock <b>windbreaks</b> are well accepted by the agricultural community, field <b>windbreaks</b> are often viewed differently. A 1982 study of the attitudes of farmers in Eastern Nebraska indicated {{that many of the}} producers were around the age of 50 and that they used different types of <b>windbreaks.</b> This study repeated that survey in the same.

40|$|<b>Windbreaks</b> often form {{networks}} of forest habitats that improve connectivity and thus conserve biodiversity, but {{little is known}} of such effects in the tropics. We determined bird species richness and community composition in <b>windbreaks</b> composed of remnant native vegetation amongst tea plantations (natural <b>windbreaks),</b> and compared it with the surrounding primary forests. Fifty-one, ten-minute point counts were conducted in each habitat type over three days. Despite the limited sampling period, our bird inventories in both natural <b>windbreaks</b> and primary forests were nearly complete, as indicated by bootstrap true richness estimator. Bird species richness and abundance between primary forests and <b>windbreaks</b> were similar, however a difference in bird community composition was observed. Abundances of important functional groups such as frugivores and insectivores did not vary between habitat types but nectarivores were more abundant in <b>windbreaks,</b> potentially {{as a result of}} the use of <b>windbreaks</b> as traveling routes, foraging and nesting sites. This preliminary study suggests that natural <b>windbreaks</b> may be important habitats for the persistence of bird species in a production landscape.

Confusingly, the forest contains no trees other than the <b>windbreak</b> of Skiddaw House, {{but it is a}} marshy upland area, at around 400 m (roughly 1,300ft), surrounded on all sides by higher fells. Three streams flow from Skiddaw Forest, dividing the Northern Fells into three sectors. Dash Beck runs north-west, the River Caldew north east and the Glenderaterra Beck south. The three ranges of the Northern Fells are the Skiddaw massif to the southwest, the Blencathra group including Mungrisdale Common to the south east and the area colloquially known as 'Back o'Skiddaw' to the north. Skiddaw House, the lone building in the forest, has variously seen service as a shepherds' bothy and a Youth Hostel.|$|E
25|$|Tsuga canadensis {{has long}} been a popular tree in cultivation. The tree's {{preference}} for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow. In addition, its very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth habit and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable ornamental tree. In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil. It is most often used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can also be trained as a dense formal hedge. It should not be used on roadsides where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to salt spray. It is also poorly adapted as a <b>windbreak</b> tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in winter. It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of urban stress, intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable. Its tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as a Christmas tree.|$|E
25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native species reintroduction, human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding thistle weed (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, <b>windbreak,</b> and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|E

Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it {{has been used as a}} <b>windbreak</b> or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered <b>windbreak.</b> One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is floriferous, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (chlorosis) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs [...] winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating.|$|E

40|$|Water for {{irrigation}} in the Canterbury region of New Zealand {{is becoming an}} increasingly precious commodity {{as it is in}} many other areas of the world. Adequate use of this resource will define the economical and environmental future of the region. Current irrigation systems, even under best management practices, over-apply water, as they do not account for spatial variability of crop water needs in fields. Over-application of water is wasteful and has environmental and economical repercussions. Water requirements are determined by crop evapotranspiration (ET). Key factors affecting ET in Canterbury are wind and solar radiation. Both of these are significantly affected by <b>windbreaks,</b> resulting in variability in ET and water requirements across a field. Understanding the variability in ET caused by <b>windbreaks</b> will enable for the correct application of water through precision irrigation systems. A theoretical model was developed to estimate savings in irrigation by accounting for <b>windbreaks</b> in the Canterbury region. <b>Windbreaks</b> reduce evapotranspiration and therefore crops/pasture behind <b>windbreaks</b> needs less water than those {{in other parts of the}} field. Results for a case study in Canterbury show that <b>windbreaks</b> can potentially reduce the annual on-farm water consumption by 10 to 20 %, while still maintaining ideal crop/pasture yields. In the short term, the application of precision irrigation systems in fields with <b>windbreaks</b> can have farm level benefits of improved water use and reduced nitrogen/phosphorus leaching. In the long term this could translate directly into cost savings because of a potential decrease in energy used {{for irrigation}} (running pumps, etc.) ...|$|R
