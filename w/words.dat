5|$|Although {{at least}} some of the poems {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, there is a large enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable Kokinshū for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style.

5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 <b>words</b> before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 <b>words</b> in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three <b>words</b> per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of <b>words</b> learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new <b>words</b> a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two <b>words</b> such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two <b>words,</b> and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of <b>words.</b> Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of <b>words</b> that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 <b>words</b> that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 <b>words.</b> However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 <b>words</b> from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different <b>words.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{first version}} of Microsoft <b>Word</b> was {{developed}} by Charles Simonyi and Richard Brodie, former Xerox programmers hired by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1981. Both programmers worked on Xerox Bravo, the first WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) <b>word</b> processor. The first <b>Word</b> version, <b>Word</b> 1.0, was released in October 1983 for Xenix and MS-DOS; {{it was followed by}} four very similar versions that were not very successful. The first Windows version was released in 1989, with a slightly improved interface. When Windows 3.0 was released in 1990, <b>Word</b> became a huge commercial success. <b>Word</b> for Windows 1.0 was followed by <b>Word</b> 2.0 in 1991 and <b>Word</b> 6.0 in 1993. Then it was renamed to <b>Word</b> 95 and <b>Word</b> 97, <b>Word</b> 2000 and <b>Word</b> for Office XP (to follow Windows commercial names). With the release of <b>Word</b> 2003, the numbering was again year-based.

50|$|The term awe {{stems from}} the Old English <b>word</b> ege, meaning “terror, dread, awe,” which may have arisen from the Greek <b>word</b> áchos, meaning “pain.” The <b>word</b> awesome {{originated}} from the <b>word</b> awe in the late 16th century, to mean “filled with awe.” The <b>word</b> awful also originated from the <b>word</b> awe, to replace the <b>word</b> Old English <b>word</b> egeful (“dreadful”).|$|R
30|$|<b>Word</b> intuition is speakers’ {{intuitive}} {{knowledge of}} what a <b>word</b> is and can be defined individually or collectively. The individual <b>word</b> intuition is the <b>word</b> intuition of individual speakers. Whereas, the collective <b>word</b> intuition is the <b>word</b> intuition of the whole language community. In English and other languages with conventionalized <b>word</b> boundaries in orthography, collective <b>word</b> intuition can be roughly modeled by the collective behavior in marking orthographic wordbreaks. However, in languages without conventionalized <b>word</b> boundaries in orthography, explicit empirical evidence for both individual and collective <b>word</b> intuition {{is very difficult to}} obtain.|$|R
5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein <b>words</b> from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan <b>words</b> which are fingerspelled, either very short English <b>words</b> or abbreviations of longer English <b>words,</b> e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called <b>words,</b> and if they are bound to other <b>words</b> or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of <b>words</b> are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

30|$|<b>Word</b> intuition is speakers’ {{intuitive}} {{knowledge on}} wordhood. Collective <b>word</b> intuition is the <b>word</b> intuition {{of the whole}} language community. Given this definition, the optimal <b>word</b> segmentation result in Chinese NLP should reflect collective <b>word</b> intuition. It is also believed that an ideal definition of Chinese <b>word</b> should accord with the collective <b>word</b> intuition of Chinese speakers. To test the validity and feasibility of modeling collective <b>word</b> intuition, {{it is important to}} know to what extent Chinese speakers agree with each other on what is a <b>word.</b> In this study, we measured <b>word</b> intuition agreement using Mechanical Turk-based Chinese <b>word</b> segmentation experiment. Three metrics were used: proportionate agreement, Cohen’s kappa, and Fleiss’ kappa. The results show that Chinese speakers agree with each other almost perfectly on what is a <b>word.</b> And we found no evidence to support an effect of semantic transparency on <b>word</b> intuition agreement. Such high <b>word</b> intuition agreement among Chinese speakers supports the psychological reality of Chinese <b>word</b> and also suggests that that it is quite feasible to formulate a definition of Chinese <b>word</b> by modeling the collective <b>word</b> intuition of Chinese speakers.|$|R
