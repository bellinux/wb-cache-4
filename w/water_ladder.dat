5000|$|These {{appliances}} are broadly {{similar to}} the <b>water</b> tender <b>ladders,</b> but carry a different range of equipment, with ladders up to 10.5 m. They are not the primary responder to a road traffic collision - despite carrying hydaulic cutting equipment, the equipment is not as robust or effective as of that carried on a <b>Water</b> Tender <b>Ladder.</b> The <b>water</b> tenders are used to support <b>water</b> tender <b>ladders</b> at property fires and to attend miscellaneous calls. A water tender, like its counterpart, is capable of carrying up to six fire fighters.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Water</b> <b>Ladder</b> or Water Tender is {{very similar}} to the {{aforementioned}} appliance, however with less emphasis on rescue gear and will usually carry a smaller ladder (for example 9m or 10.5m).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>water</b> <b>ladder</b> {{was built}} as an {{alternative}} to the paddle wheel to get around the problem that to lift water to a greater height, a bigger wheel is needed. [...] Despite the emergence of new pumps that operate on other principles, the <b>water</b> <b>ladder</b> remains an important tool as some of its other benefits are that they can be built and repaired easily at a very low cost. This is possible as all the components can be built from local resources, such as wood; which can be obtained and shaped into the desired form easily.|$|E

50|$|A <b>water</b> tender <b>ladder's</b> major {{capabilities}} include {{pumping up}} to 3,000 litres (660 gallons) per minute between two locations. It has a storage capacity of 1,800 litres (396 gallons). The pump carries {{a range of}} ladders up to 13.5 m. Inside the cab are four sets of compressed air breathing apparatus. Each pump has several lockers on the external of the pump. Inside there {{is a set of}} powered hydraulic rescue equipment, a thermal imaging camera, water rescue equipment, a positive pressure ventilation fan and safety at height equipment. There are occasions when a Water Tender, and not the <b>Water</b> Tender <b>Ladder,</b> would be mobilised first.

5000|$|There is no {{specific}} {{technology that is}} advocated with self-supply. Self-supply is rather an approach of how to improve access to water and sanitation services, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "moving up the water and sanitation ladders". [...] At the bottom of the [...] "water ladder" [...] are unprotected sources of water. The users [...] "climb the water ladder" [...] by adding protection to their water source or additional technology for convenience. For example, a user with an unlined hand dug well with a rope and bucket as a lifting device would be {{at the bottom of the}} <b>water</b> <b>ladder.</b> A user with a lined hand dug well would be higher on the <b>water</b> <b>ladder</b> since the water source has a lower risk of contamination due to the lining. A user with a hand pump would have the benefit of being able to get a larger volume of water more quickly than with a bucket, and contamination of the source is reduced. Finally, a user with a motorized pump would have the convenience of not having to expend any manual energy on pumping water. It should be noted that even sources on the lowest rungs of the ladder would provide service all day, every day, all year round.|$|E

40|$|Multiple-use {{services}} (MUS) {{have recently}} {{gained increased attention}} as an alternative form of providing rural water services in an integrated manner. This stems from the growing recognition that users anyway tend to use water systems for multiple purposes. This paper aims to characterise this practice {{on the basis of}} case evidence collected in eight countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The cases show that people almost universally use water for both domestic and productive activities at and around the homestead. Although seldom the main source of people’s income or food production, these activities are of considerable importance for people’s livelihoods. The extent to which people use water for multiple purposes is closely related to the level of access to water expressed {{in the form of a}} <b>water</b> <b>ladder</b> in this paper. The case studies presented demonstrate how access is created by different types and combinations of well-known technologies. Additional financial and management measures are required to ensure sustainability of services. Despite the practical feasibility of the MUS approach, it is not yet widely applied by service providers and sector agencies due to observed barriers in institutional uptake. A better characterisation of MUS, alongside a learning-driven stakeholder process was able to overcome some of these barriers and improve the consideration of multiple uses of water in policy and practice...|$|E
40|$|A new {{two-dimensional}} 3 d- 4 f mixed-metal mixed dicarboxylate (homocyclic and heterocyclic) of {{the formula}} [Gd 2 (H 2 O) 2 Ni(H 2 O) 2 (1, 2 -bdc) 2 (2, 5 -pydc) 2] 3 8 H 2 O (1; 1, 2 -H 2 bdc = 1, 2 -benzenedicarboxylic acid and 2, 5 -H 2 pydc = 2, 5 - pyridinedicarboxylic acid) has been prepared by employing the hydrothermal method. The structure has infinite onedimensional-Gd-O-Gd- chains {{formed by the}} edge-shared GdO 9 polyhedral units, resulting exclusively from the connectivity between the Gd 3 + ions and the 1, 2 -bdc units. The chains are connected by the [Ni(H 2 O) 2 (2, 5 -pydc) 2] 2 - metalloligand, forming the two-dimensional layer arrangements. The stacking of the layers creates hydrophilic and hydrophobic spaces in the interlamellar region. A one-dimensional <b>water</b> <b>ladder</b> structure, formed by the extraframework water molecules, occupies the hydrophilic region while the benzene ring of 1, 2 -bdc occupies the hydrophobic region. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the present compound represents the first example of a 3 d- 4 f mixed-metal carboxylate in which two different aromatic dicarboxylate anions act as the linkers. The stabilization energies of the water clusters have been evaluated using density functional theory calculations. The water molecules in 1 are fully reversible accompanied by a change in color (greenish blue to brown) and coordination around Ni 2 + ions (octahedral to distorted tetrahedral) ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{international}} studies conducted confirmed that substantial economic benefits {{can be derived}} by improving the water and sanitation services standards in developing countries. The current free basic water services standard of the South Africa Government is set at the provision of 6 kl of safe drinking water per household per month, at a point of service, not further than 200 m away from every home. The terms of reference {{of this study was}} defined as the determination of the value proposition of moving up the <b>water</b> <b>ladder</b> from basic to intermediary (yard connection) water services standard. Model outputs confirmed that substantial socio-economic benefits are attainable if the free basic water services standard is increased to that of a yard connection. Government and Society, as a whole, benefits extensively, with a benefit/cost ratio of more than 30, when providing a basic service level communal stand pipe connection (4 kl/m). However, optimal benefits (+ 40) can be derived when all households are provided with at least a low pressure, 6 kl/m yard connection. Furthermore, consideration could even be given to increase the standard to 12 kl/m high pressure yard connection, although the step wise benefits/cost ratio is only 2. 6. The respective capital costs for delivering the three water services standard options were respectively determined as R 7. 5 b illion (communal standpipe), R 11. 7 b (yard, low pressure) and R 14. 1 b (yard, high pressure). Findings concluded that increasing the minimum water services standard to that of a 6 kl/month yard connection and investing accordingly, will reduce poverty, increase economic development, is good socio-economic policy and will generate sustainab le benefits for Government and Community...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} address the problem of {{conveying}} changes in open-water quality to the public within surveys such as within stated preference valuation studies. This is achieved through the creation of a new <b>water</b> quality <b>ladder</b> designed to address both the use value issues which have dominated previous such ladders and ecological change and associated non-use values. The assumptions underpinning the ladder allow its levels to be related to nationally available data concerning measures of water quality so as to enhance the transferability of values derived from using such a scale. This paper also seeks to compare the new <b>water</b> quality <b>ladder</b> to the standards for different ecological states outlined by the UK Technical Advisory Group (UKTAG) for meeting the commitments of the Water Framework Directive and shows how such an analysis can be an aid to applying a benefits transfer...|$|R
5000|$|Also {{referred}} to as the [...] "second away". These appliances are broadly similar to the <b>Water</b> Tender <b>Ladders,</b> but carry a different range of equipment, with ladders up to 10.5 metres (34 ft) and carry 1400L of water. They are not the primary responder to a road traffic collision, despite carrying hydaulic cutting equipment. The water tenders are used to support <b>water</b> tender <b>ladders</b> at fires and to attend miscellaneous calls. Some Second Away appliances have the advantage of being 4x4 and sometimes they will be the first appliance to respond in harsh weathers such as snow, fire control may also mobiles the second away to turn out first if the incident is situated in a field and the all wheel drive would be necessary. A water tender, like its counterpart, is capable of carrying up to six firefighters.|$|R

The paper also provides guidance on the appropriate specification of transferable value functions arguing that these should be developed from theoretical rather than ad-hoc statistical principles. These principles are tested via a common format valuation study of water quality improvements across five countries. Results support our various hypotheses providing a set of principles for future transfer studies.

40|$|We present Herschel SPIRE-FTS {{observations}} of Arp~ 220, a nearby ULIRG. The FTS continuously covers 190 [...] 670 microns, providing a good {{measurement of the}} continuum and detection of several molecular and atomic species. We detect luminous CO (J = 4 - 3 to 13 - 12) and <b>water</b> <b>ladders</b> with comparable total luminosity; very high-J HCN absorption; OH+, H 2 O+, and HF in absorption; and CI and NII. Modeling of the continuum yields warm dust, with T = 66 K, and an unusually large optical depth of ~ 5 at 100 microns. Non-LTE modeling of the CO shows two temperature components: cold molecular gas at T ~ 50 K and warm molecular gas at T ~ 1350 K. The mass of the warm gas is 10 % of the cold gas, but dominates the luminosity of the CO ladder. The temperature of the warm gas is in excellent agreement with H 2 rotational lines. At 1350 K, H 2 dominates the cooling (~ 20 L_sun/M_sun) in the ISM compared to CO (~ 0. 4 L_sun/M_sun). We found that only a non-ionizing source such as the mechanical energy from supernovae and stellar winds can excite the warm gas and satisfy the energy budget of ~ 20 L_sun/M_sun. We detect a massive molecular outflow in Arp 220 from the analysis of strong P-Cygni line profiles observed in OH+, H 2 O+, and H 2 O. The outflow has a mass > 10 ^{ 7 } M_sun and is bound to the nuclei with velocity < 250 km/s. The large column densities observed for these molecular ions strongly favor {{the existence of an}} X-ray luminous AGN (10 ^{ 44 } ergs/s) in Arp 220.
