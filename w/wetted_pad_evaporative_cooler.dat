This study, thus, studied the <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> efficiency and pressure drop of recycled High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and rice husk as a <b>wetted</b> <b>pad</b> in <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> system. Approach: The study was done by establishing the tested <b>wetted</b> <b>pad</b> with 25. 4 and 50. 8 mm of thickness. The velocity air flow through <b>wetted</b> <b>pad</b> was controlled at 1, 2 and 3 m sec− 1 respectively. In addition, the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures of inlet air were controlled at 30. 1 ± 1. 0 °C and 23. 2 ± 1. 1 °C, respectively. The commercial <b>wetted</b> <b>pad</b> was also tested in order to compare results with rice husk and recycled HDPE. Results: It was found that rice husk <b>wetted</b> <b>pad</b> gave the average saturation efficiency of 55. 9 %, while HDPE gave the average saturation efficiency of 29. 1 %.

40|$|A {{special test}} setup is {{designed}} to evaluate the performance of three natural fibers {{to be used as}} <b>wetted</b> <b>pads</b> in <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling.</b> The chosen fibers are date palm fibers (stem), jute and luffa. As a reference, a widely used commercial <b>wetted</b> <b>pad</b> is chosen. The performance criteria include cooling efficiency, material performance and cooling efficiency degradation. The results show that the average cooling efficiency is highest for jute at 62. 1 %, compared to 55. 1 % for luffa fibers, 49. 9 % for the reference commercial pad and 38. 9 % for date palm fiber. Material performance tests comprise salt deposition and bio-degradation (mold forming). Jute has the least salt deposition followed by palm and luffa fibers. The commercial type has the highest salt deposits. The highest resistance to mold forming is offered by luffa followed by palm fibers. The commercial type and jute have very poor performance. The results of the cooling efficiency degradation indicate that luffa has an overall advantage over the other fibers. Palm fibers and the commercial type have a significant reduction in the cooling efficiency, while jute has the highest deterioration.

The main aspects of <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> systems, in terms of heat and mass transfer and both the external and internal climatic conditions were integrated {{to set up the}} numerical model. The crop (tomato) was simulated using the equivalent porous medium approach by the addition of a momentum and energy source term. The temperature and humidity of incoming air, the operational characteristics of exhaust fans and the pressure drop occuring in the pad, were specified to set up the CFD model. The second model considers the greenhouse as a heat exchanger. Based on greenhouse structural characteristics, external climatic conditions, pad efficiency and ventilation rate, the air temperature distribution is predicted. The results, concerning the air temperature, provided both by numerical and analytical model, were validated by experimental measurements obtained at a height level of 1. 2 m above the ground {{in the middle of the}} crop canopy.

The experimental results showed strong climate heterogeneity along the air stream from cooling pads to extracting fans. The overall efficiency of the system was quite high (~ 80 %) and in combination with the dry and warm outside climate conditions enabled the air to enter the greenhouse with a temperature even 10 °C lower than that of outside air temperature. However, due to the long air path through the greenhouse, air exits the greenhouse even 8 °C warmer than the inlet air. Air vapour pressure deficit varied from 0. 5 kPa (after the cooling pads) to 2 kPa (extracting fans).

Increase of poultry production in Saudi Arabia {{can be attributed to}} the development of poultry medicines, vaccines, and feed supplements as well as the use of environmental modification systems that provide a suitable environment for poultry growth, production, and health. A survey of the environmental control for poultry was conducted in the central region of Saudi Arabia during the period of 1999 - 2000. Information was obtained on the building size, labor, material of construction, cooling and heating systems, and automatic control. Also, the results included environmental control problems facing poultry production in Saudi Arabia. The results can be used to help poultry producers conserve energy, and find priorities for future research studies.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the fan and <b>pad</b> <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> system for a photovoltaic powered greenhouse was investigated under extreme summer conditions. Temperature, relative humidity and electricity consumed for cooling were studied in a Quonset greenhouse covered with a sheet of corrugated Fiberglass-Reinforced plastic producing cucumbers. Pads clogging due to salt buildup was found to reduce the cooling performance. Additionally pads clogging caused the cooling system to run at longer time, causing more power {{to be drawn from}} the photovoltaic system. As a result, the system tripped three times during the summer period for one to three days. During most of the daytime, the averages of inside air temperatures with clogged pads were between 30 and 51 °C, and the inside relative humidity was between 8 % and 30 %. This adversely affected plant growth, and caused wilting to plants {{in the second half of}} the greenhouse especially when accompanied by high solar radiation levels (10 : 00 to 16 : 00). Shade reduced the stress on plants, but air temperatures and relative humidity were far from the suitable ranges for good production practice. On the average, temperatures with shade ranged from 40 to 47. 5 °C, and relative humidity ranged from 8 to 12 %. Replacing pads clearly improved the greenhouse environment. Air temperature and relative humidity inside the greenhouse during daytime ranged from 28 to 32 °C, and from 39. 3 to 44 %, respectively. The cooling efficiency for new pads was averaged 71 %, with 8 to 17. 3 °C reductions in ambient temperature. Electricity consumption with new pads was found to be around 22 % less than that with old pads. Results also showed that the electricity consumption increased non-linearly as the ambient temperature increased. The cooling system consumed the maximum level of electricity (2. 7 and 3 kW) at ambient temperature of 37 °C or higher suggesting that the cooling system was in full operation.

Information was obtained on the building size, labor, material of construction, cooling and heating systems, and automatic control for fifteen commercial poultry buildings. Ventilation rates to control temperature, moisture and ammonia were estimated and evaluated for every building. Also, supplemental heat capacities to maintain the desired indoor temperature were determined. The {{results showed that the}} floor space for chickens ranged from 0. 052 to 0. 061 m 2 /bird. Walls and roofs were constructed with metal panels, concrete blocks and insulating materials. Cooling was accomplished by fan and <b>pad</b> <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> systems. The result obtained from this study indicated that summer ventilation rates were between 0. 80 - 1. 51 air exchanges per minute, and between 0. 31 - 0. 46 air exchanges per minute for winter. It was predicted that ventilation rates during summer could control moisture and ammonia in all farms, while could not control temperature in 33 % of farms. The results indicated that ventilation was necessary during winter to control temperature, moisture and ammonia. During winter days, estimated ventilation rates for temperature control were higher than those required for ammonia and moisture control. However, during winter nights, predicted ventilation rates for ammonia control were higher than those required for temperature and moisture control. Therefore, ventilation rates for ammonia control were considered to be minimum ventilation rates, and to be continuous during night. In such a condition, supplemental heat was required to maintain the building at the desired air temperature. Winter ventilation rates were much higher than those required for moisture and ammonia control. This increased mixing of cold outside air with warm inside air. Therefore, indoor temperature could not be maintained at the desired level during winter season even though thermal outputs for heaters were higher than the predicted supplemental heat capacity. Heat was distributed in the building by discharging hot air directly or through perforated polyethylene duct. Some major problems of environment control were salt precipitation and dust accumulation in the cooling pad, non-uniform temperature in the building, and low efficiency of cooling and heating systems. Some recommendations to improve the performance of the environmental control systems for poultry buildings in Saudi Arabia were presented...|$|R

5000|$|Passive <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> {{techniques}} in buildings, such as <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> towers, {{have only been}} developed and studied in the last 30 years. In 1974, William H. Goettl invented the [...] "Combination Refrigeration and <b>Evaporative</b> <b>Cooling</b> Air Conditioner" [...] in Arizona after noticing that <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> technology works better in arid climates rather than humidity but that a combination unit would be more effective. In 1986, two researchers at the University of Arizona, Tucson, W. Cunningham and T. Thompson, constructed the first passive <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> tower in Tucson, AZ. This performance data from this experimental facility became the foundation of today’s <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> tower design guidelines, developed by Baruch Givoni.|$|R
40|$|<b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{an energy}} {{efficient}} and environmentally friendly air conditioning technology. Research {{and application of}} <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> in China have been very fruitful; however, they were little known to the world because most of works were published in Chinese. Therefore, this paper intends to present a comprehensive summary on them. The working principles and thermodynamic characteristics {{of different types of}} <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling,</b> including direct, indirect and semi-indirect <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling,</b> are first introduced. Experimental and theoretical research works on feasibility studies, performance test and optimization as well as heat and mass transfer analysis are then reviewed in detail. The feasibilities of <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> under different climates, efficiencies of various <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> equipment, and critical parameters and techniques for improving the efficiencies as well as numerical modeling of <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> processes are recalled.

40|$|<b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> systems using a {{combination}} of <b>evaporative</b> <b>pads</b> and extractor fans require greenhouses to be hermetic. The greatest concentration of greenhouses in the world is located in southeast Spain, but these tend not to be hermetic structures and consequently can only rely on fogging systems as <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> techniques. <b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> boxes provide an alternative to such systems. Using a low-speed wind tunnel, the present work has compared the performance of this system with four pads of differing geometry and thickness manufactured by two different companies. The results obtained show that the plastic packing in the cooling unit produces a pressure drop of 11. 05 Pa at 2 m·s− 1, which is between 51. 27 % and 94. 87 % lower than that produced by the cellulose pads. This pressure drop was not influenced by increases in the water flow. The <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> boxes presented greater saturation efficiency at the same flow, namely 82. 63 %, as opposed to an average figure of 65 % for the cellulose pads; and also had a lower specific consumption of water, at around 3. 05 L·h− 1 ·m− 2 ·°C− 1. Consequently, we conclude that <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> boxes are a good option for cooling non-hermetic greenhouses such as those most frequently used in the Mediterranean basin.

40|$|We have {{simulated}} the <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> of trapped atoms using a {{very efficient}} method originally introduced {{for the study}} of molecular gas dynamics. This straightforward and intuitive method allows the dynamics of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> process to be studied and requires fewer simplifications and assumptions than other methods. In particular, the method is not restricted to distributions close to equilibrium and therefore it can model accurately rapid forced <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling,</b> which is an important technique for cooling trapped atoms. We present the results of simulations for forced <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> in one, two and three dimensions...|$|R
