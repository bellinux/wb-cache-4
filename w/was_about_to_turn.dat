5|$|On 1 February, Jirgalang {{announced}} that the Shunzhi Emperor, who <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority. The regency was thus officially abolished. Jirgalang then moved to the attack. In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives: Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed. Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon {{a growing number of}} followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon's former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government.|$|E
5|$|That May, RKO {{released}} Citizen Kane, coproducing with director Orson Welles's Mercury Productions. While {{it opened}} to strong reviews and {{would go on}} to be hailed {{as one of the greatest}} movies ever made, it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the Hearst newspaper chain on RKO. The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons—like Kane, critically lauded and overbudget—and the expensive embarrassment of his aborted documentary It's All True. The three Mercury productions combined to drain $2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had reported an overall deficit of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit more than $500,000 in 1941. Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year's Kitty Foyle, held out for a freelance contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in just one more RKO production, thirteen years later. On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his resignation. He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the corner. Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half-decade.|$|E

Cavalry General John Kelly, a former commander of the 8th Arkansas, appeared before the men, and in an electrifying charge, led them into the corn to stop the Union attack cold. Baucum and the unit were cited in General Cleburne's report on the battle. Casualties for the 19th portion of the regiment were 8 killed and 5 wounded.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> 50 and {{was heavily}} in the spotlight. [...] Sinatra's {{relationship}} with 20-year-old Mia Farrow was constantly in the news. [...] A CBS television documentary had upset Sinatra, who felt that his life was being pried into and was unhappy about speculation in the documentary about his connection to Mafia leaders. [...] He was also worried about his starring role in an upcoming NBC show named after his album, A Man and His Music and his various business ventures in real estate, his film company, his record label and an airline. [...] At the time, Sinatra maintained a personal staff of 75.|$|E
500|$|Through this passage, Bryan {{maintained}} {{the contrast between}} the common man and the city-dwelling elite. It was clear to listeners as he worked his way through the comparisons that he would refer to the farmer, and when he did, the hall exploded with sound. His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman, whom Bryan cast as a gambler. The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs, and it was several minutes before he could continue. The police in the convention hall, not sharing the enthusiasm for silver, were described by the press (some of whose members were caught up in the frenzy) as standing as if they thought the audience <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> on them. When Bryan resumed, his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes. One farmer in the gallery had been about to leave rather than listen to Bryan, whom he deemed a Populist; he had been persuaded to stay. At Bryan's words, he threw his hat into the air, slapped the empty seat in front of him with his coat, and shouted, [...] "My God! My God! My God!" ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Rickey's {{recruits}} for the Browns, George Sisler, {{became a}} major star in the early 1920s. [...] Outdrawing their tenants substantially, the Browns came within one game of the AL pennant in 1922. [...] However, the tide <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in the Cardinals' favor. [...] After confidently predicting {{there would be a}} World Series in Sportsman's Park by 1926, Browns owner Phil Ball invested in extensive upgrades in its anticipation, including increasing the park's capacity from 18,000 to 30,000. [...] Ball was correct––a World Series was about to be played in Sportsman's Park in 1926—but one of the participants did not include the Browns.|$|E
2500|$|Opposition to Barberi {{was also}} present here where on his {{journeys}} to the Mass centre local youths would throw rocks at him, though two youths {{took to the}} decision to become Catholics when they were greatly edified to see Barberi kiss each rock that hit him {{and place it in}} his pocket. During many of these frequent attacks Barberi barely escaped death. Local Protestant ministers often held anti-Catholic lectures and sermons to ward the people away from Barberi and the Catholics. Wilson records how one of these ministers followed Barberi along a street shouting out various arguments against transubstantiation, Barberi was silent, but as the man <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> off, Barberi retorted: [...] "Jesus Christ said over the consecrated elements, [...] "This is my body" [...] you say [...] "No. It is not his body!" [...] Who then am I to believe? I prefer to believe Jesus Christ." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{was born}} in Brownsville, Brooklyn, before at four his mother moved the family out, anticipating that the {{neighbourhood}} <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> into a ghost town. According to Turner, [...] "You couldn't {{be seen on the}} streets after a certain hour, because the place was like the wild, wild West. Everyone had a gun." [...] Their new home resided in LeFrak City, Queens. Here, Turner grew up and attended John Adams High School, a school renowned for its American football programme. Turner was a wide receiver, until at 15, he figured it might not be the game for him. He turned his attention to basketball heading into his junior year, practising six hours every day during the summer and acquired good dunking skills. However, when he tried out for the school team that fall as a junior, he didn't make it, his coach pointing out to him that there was more to the game than dunking.|$|E

2500|$|When he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> twenty-one, and {{his legal}} {{obligation}} {{to work as}} apprentice on his father's farm {{was coming to an}} end, his father permitted him to take the profits from the crops of one of their fields. Lomax used this, along with the money from selling his favorite pony, to pay to further his education. In the fall of 1887, he attended Granbury College in Granbury and in May 1888, he graduated and eventually became a teacher. He began his first job as a teacher at a country school in Clifton, southeast of Meridian. As time went on, he grew tired of the low pay and country-school drudgery and he applied for work at Weatherford College in Weatherford in Parker County in the spring of 1889. He was hired as principal by the school's new president, David Switzer, who had previously been president of Granbury College until it was closed down and he was transferred to Weatherford. In 1890, after having attended a summer course at Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, Lomax returned to Texas where he became head of the Business Department of Weatherford College. Each summer, between 1891 and 1894, he also attended the annual lecture-and-concert series at New York State's [...] Chautauqua Institute, which pioneered adult education (and where Lomax himself would later lecture). According to Porterfield, [...] "There he improved his mathematics, struggled with Latin, listened to music that stirred him (opera and oratorios, light 'classics' of the day), and learned, for the first time, of two poets—Tennyson and Browning—whose work would soon {{become an integral part of}} his intellectual equipment." ...|$|E
