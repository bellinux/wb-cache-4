The Hokies came into the 1968 season with high expectations. From 1963 to 1967, Virginia Tech was the 12th winningest major college {{football}} program, recording 36 wins, 13 losses, and one tie—putting the Hokies just behind Notre Dame in winning percentage. During the regular season, linebacker Mike <b>Widger</b> emerged as a major threat on defense for Tech. In the Hokies' win over No. 18 Florida State in 1968, <b>Widger</b> intercepted two passes. Shortly after Liberty Bowl committee chairman Bud Dudley selected the Hokies to play in the Liberty Bowl, <b>Widger</b> was named a first-team Associated Press All-American, marking him {{as one of the best}} players at his position in the country.|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{then moved}} to Lower Lorraine, where Gothelo II had just died and Dirk IV of Holland had seized Flushing. Henry {{personally}} led a river campaign against Count Dirk. Both count and Flushing fell to him. He gave the latter to Bernold, Bishop of Utrecht, and returned to Aachen to celebrate Pentecost and {{to decide on the}} fate of Lorraine. Henry pitied and restored Godfrey, but he gave the county of Verdun to the bishop of the city. [...] This did not conciliate the duke. Henry gave the lower duchy to Frederick. He then appointed Adalbert archbishop of Bremen and summoned <b>Widger,</b> Archbishop of Ravenna, to a trial.|$|E
60|$|The {{plausible}} couple {{are no less}} {{plausible to}} each other than to third parties. They are always loving and harmonious. The plausible gentleman calls his wife 'darling,' and the plausible lady addresses him as 'dearest.' If it be Mr. and Mrs. Bobtail <b>Widger,</b> Mrs. <b>Widger</b> is 'Lavinia, darling,' and Mr. <b>Widger</b> is 'Bobtail, dearest.' Speaking of each other, they observe the same tender form. Mrs. <b>Widger</b> relates what 'Bobtail' said, and Mr. <b>Widger</b> recounts what 'darling' thought and did.|$|E
60|$|If you {{sit next}} to the {{plausible}} lady at a dinner-table, she takes the earliest opportunity of expressing her belief that you are acquainted with the Clickits; she is sure she has heard the Clickits speak of you--she must not tell you in what terms, or you will take her for a flatterer. You admit {{a knowledge of the}} Clickits; the plausible lady immediately launches out in their praise. She quite loves the Clickits. Were there ever such true- hearted, hospitable, excellent people--such a gentle, interesting little woman as Mrs. Clickit, or such a frank, unaffected creature as Mr. Clickit? were there ever two people, in short, so little spoiled by the world as they are? 'As who, darling?' cries Mr. <b>Widger,</b> from {{the opposite side of the}} table. 'The Clickits, dearest,' replies Mrs. <b>Widger.</b> 'Indeed you are right, darling,' Mr. <b>Widger</b> rejoins; 'the Clickits are a very high-minded, worthy, estimable couple.' Mrs. <b>Widger</b> remarking that Bobtail always grows quite eloquent upon this subject, Mr. <b>Widger</b> admits that he feels very strongly whenever such people as the Clickits and some other friends of his (here he glances at the host and hostess) are mentioned; for they are an honour to human nature, and do one good to think of. 'YOU know the Clickits, Mrs. Jackson?' he says, addressing the lady of the house. 'No, indeed; we have not that pleasure,' she replies. 'You astonish me!' exclaims Mr. Widger: 'not know the Clickits! why, you are the very people of all others who ought to be their bosom friends. You are kindred beings; you are one and the same thing:- not know the Clickits! Now WILL you know the Clickits? Will you make a point of knowing them? Will you meet them in a friendly way at our house one evening, and be acquainted with them?' Mrs. Jackson will be quite delighted; nothing would give her more pleasure. 'Then, Lavinia, my darling,' says Mr. <b>Widger,</b> 'mind you don't lose sight of that; now, pray take care that Mr. and Mrs. Jackson know the Clickits without loss of time. Such people ought not to be strangers to each other.' Mrs. <b>Widger</b> books both families as the centre of attraction for her next party; and Mr. <b>Widger,</b> going on to expatiate upon the virtues of the Clickits, adds to their other moral qualities, that they keep one of the neatest phaetons in town, and have two thousand a year.|$|E

For, will you believe it, she was not a <b>widger</b> woman as has experience in the ways of men, but a huzzy in a bragian cap like them the Nuns wear in [...] "Mariar Monk," [...] as you may have seen it in the small sweet-shops, at a penny. And her hands as white as her papistry cap, and she a turning up of her nose at what I had took, and a presuming to give ME advice about nussing, as St. Pancradge's Churchyard wouldn't hold them I've seen comfortable to their long homes, and no complaints made but ever the highest satigefaction. So I ups and gives her a bit of my mind; and Mrs. Todgers coming down, [...] "It's she goes or me," [...] says I, [...] "for never will Sairey Gamp nuss, sick or monthly, with a pardner as has not confidence in me, nor I in her, but contrary." [...] Then SHE says she'll go and speak to the doctor about it; and out she tramps with her nose in the air, and sneezing most awful, not being accustomed to that which I take, find it strengthening, but as it have been a cause of sorrow and strife let it be nameless between you and me. For to have the name [...] "Snuffey" [...] brought forward it is what the heart can forgive, but never forget in this valley of the shaddock.|$|E
