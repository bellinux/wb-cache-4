25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. <b>What</b> <b>right</b> had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E
25|$|In April 1205 the Bishop of Hereford {{was summoned}} {{to appear before the}} court for his refusal to admit a {{suitable}} priest to this church currently in the possession of Cecilia Devereux. In his defense he stated that the clergy of the Hereford Chapter refused to allow an appointment as they claimed possession of this chapel. They requested the right to present their case. On 6 June 1205 Hugh, Dean of Hereford, paid 2 marks for convening another court to hear his suit countering the recognition of Cecilia’s holding of the chapel at Putley. On 29 June 1206, the Bishop of Hereford and his attorney appeared before the court claiming the church of Putley as their right, and that the grant to Cecilia Devereux had only occurred because the hearing proceeded too quickly to allow them to present their case. When the canons were informed of Cecilia’s claim, they had requested that the sheriff of Hereford put her claim on hold and were told this would require a warrant of the king. The canons submitted an assize presenting their position, and paid 12 shillings for the court to be summoned. On 15 October 1206 the Canons of Hereford appeared to show by <b>what</b> <b>right</b> the claim of Cecilia to the chapel of Putley should be set aside. They argued that they had been in possession of the chapel for over 60 years, and presented the original charter granting them the chapel by William Devereux. They also presented a charter the Bishop of Hereford, which later confirmed the original grant. They argued that the granting of the claim of Cecilia Devereux had occurred too quickly for them to respond, and when they had discovered that it had occurred they began the proceedings to regain their rights. On the payment of 40 shillings, the sheriff was ordered to have a jury assembled on 26 November 1206. The sheriff failed to gather the jury on this day and the hearing was postponed to January 1207. Hugh, Dean of Hereford, put Walter de la Puille in his place for the hearing now occurring on 29 January 1207. On this date the court found in favor of the Canons of Hereford. On 7 October 1207 Cecilia Devereux was fined 3 marks, and she released her claims and those of her future heirs. The canons paid Cecilia 8 marks, and granted her the privilege of having her name celebrated in Hereford Cathedral at the annual thanksgiving to benefactors, and daily in service of the church of Putley.|$|E

500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by <b>what</b> <b>right</b> of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E
500|$|Jinnah devoted much of {{his time}} to his law {{practice}} in the early 1900s, but remained politically involved. [...] Jinnah began political life by attending the Congress's twentieth annual meeting, in Bombay in December 1904. He {{was a member of the}} moderate group in the Congress, favouring Hindu–Muslim unity in achieving self-government, and following such leaders as Mehta, Naoroji, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. They were opposed by leaders such as Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai, who sought quick action towards independence. [...] In 1906, a delegation of Muslim leaders headed by the Aga Khan called on the new Viceroy of India, Lord Minto, to assure him of their loyalty and to ask for assurances that in any political reforms they would be protected from the [...] "unsympathetic [...] majority". [...] Dissatisfied with this, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper Gujarati, asking <b>what</b> <b>right</b> the members of the delegation had to speak for Indian Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed. [...] When many of the same leaders met in Dacca in December of that year to form the All-India Muslim League to advocate for their community's interests, Jinnah was again opposed. The Aga Khan later wrote that it was [...] "freakishly ironic" [...] that Jinnah, who would lead the League to independence, [...] "came out in bitter hostility toward all that I and my friends had done... He said that our principle of separate electorates was dividing the nation against itself." [...] In its earliest years, however, the League was not influential; Minto refused to consider it as the Muslim community's representative, and it was ineffective in preventing the 1911 repeal of the partition of Bengal, an action seen as a blow to Muslim interests.|$|E
