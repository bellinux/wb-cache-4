5|$|After {{his wife}} Sita is kidnapped by the demon-king Ravana, Rama {{and his brother}} Lakshmana wander the forest searching for her. Upon meeting the monkey-warrior Hanuman, they are taken to the exiled Sugriva. Rama forms an {{alliance}} with Sugriva, whom he will help; in order to defeat Vali and regain his wife Ruma and his kingship. In return Sugriva <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> {{in the search for}} Sita. As agreed, Sugriva challenges Vali in the wrestling contest, but Rama is unable to distinguish between the two fighters and Sugriva loses the contest. Rama explains his predicament to Sugriva and tells him to re-challenge Vali, but this time, Rama garlands Sugriva to differentiate him from Vali.|$|E
5|$|Pym, who {{manipulated}} Lang {{through an}} unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang {{to become the}} new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as a galley slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who {{has been charged with}} destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E

Stretching before the activity and during breaks <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> in alleviating tension at the wrist. Place the hand firmly {{on a flat}} surface and gently press for a few seconds to stretch the wrist and fingers. An example for an isometric exercise of the wrist is done by clenching the fist tightly, releasing and fanning out fingers. None of these stretches or exercises should cause pain or discomfort.|$|E

Halt manages to {{recognise}} an arrow, shot by the Temujai and becomes instantly worried. Two decades ago, the Temujai had nearly conquered the world, but with politics and a dish of bad shellfish, the invasion was stopped. Halt and Horace, after managing to track the Temujai down, came to <b>Will's</b> <b>aid</b> and they rescue Cassandra.|$|R
60|$|It {{was really}} an offence to me when the {{jacketing}} ceased. I sadly missed that dream world of mine. But not for long. I found that I could suspend animation by the exercise of my <b>will,</b> <b>aided</b> mechanically by constricting my chest and abdomen with the blanket. Thus I induced physiological and psychological states similar to those caused by the jacket. So, at will, and without the old torment, I was free to roam through time.|$|R

25|$|Mature Th cells {{express the}} surface protein CD4 and are {{referred}} to as CD4+ T cells. Such CD4+ T cells are generally treated as having a pre-defined role as helper T cells within the immune system. For example, when an antigen-presenting cell expresses an antigen on MHC class II, a CD4+ cell <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> those cells through a combination of cell to cell interactions (e.g. CD40 (protein) and CD40L) and through cytokines.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerospace}} program's training fleet {{is made up}} of Diamond DA40 {{single-engine aircraft}} featuring glass cockpits, with an assortment of other single- and multi-engine aircraft available. In 2010, the Department of Aerospace purchased ten radar simulators as well as a one-of-a-kind 360 degree control tower simulator to enhance training for its air traffic control students. These simulators allow students to experience lifelike air traffic control scenarios that <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> in preparing them for training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.|$|E

In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E

25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of proteins}} in aqueous buffers {{depends on the}} distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues on the protein's surface. Hydrophobic residues predominantly occur in the globular protein core, but some exist in patches on the surface. Proteins that have high hydrophobic amino acid content on the surface have low solubility in an aqueous solvent. Charged and polar surface residues interact with ionic groups in the solvent and increase the solubility of a protein. Knowledge of a protein's amino acid composition <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> in determining an ideal precipitation solvent and methods.|$|E
25|$|The Mars Orbiter Mission {{team won}} US-based National Space Society's 2015 Space Pioneer Award {{in the science}} and {{engineering}} category. NSS said the award was given as the Indian agency successfully executed a Mars mission in its first attempt; and the spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with a high apoapsis where, with its high resolution camera, it is taking full-disk colour imagery of Mars. Very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past, mostly on approach to the planet, as most imaging is done looking straight down in mapping mode. These images <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> planetary scientists.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{creation}} of TACyL, the national government began investing heavily in the country's freight network with an AR$12 billion investment to improve its infrastructure, renewing 30% of the rails over the following 2 years. This investment also included purchasing 100 locomotives and 3,500 freight cars from China for TACyL which are expected to arrive in 2015, while a separate investment saw {{the purchase of a}} further 1,000 cars from Argentine company Fabricaciones Militares. Further renovation of infrastructure for passenger lines, such as the complete replacement of rails on the Buenos Aires - Rosario - Córdoba - Tucumán route of the General Mitre Railway, <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> private operators such as Nuevo Central Argentino who use those segments.|$|E
25|$|This species exists {{mostly in}} {{tropical}} areas with distinct rainy seasons, {{and the young}} hatch near {{the time of the}} first rains of the summer (July–August), after the preceding dry season and before the bodies of water where they live flood. In this stage of development of their young, mother American crocodiles exhibit a unique mode of parental care. During the hatching process, when the young American crocodiles are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks. These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs if they have been covered. Then she <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop them up with her mouth, carrying them to the closest water source.|$|E

The third track on the Main Line <b>will</b> <b>aid</b> in relieving the crowding on the Main Line which is expected to grow after the East Side Access project is complete.
