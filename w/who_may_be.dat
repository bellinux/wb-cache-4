Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E

5|$|Terra Nova {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} first squad-oriented games with {{three-dimensional}} (3D) graphics; the player is often assisted by artificially intelligent teammates <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> given tactical commands. Conceived by Looking Glass after the completion of their first game, , Terra Nova was subject to a long and difficult development process, caused in part by the production of its full motion video cutscenes. The game's TED engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics; the latter enables such effects as procedural animation.|$|E
5|$|The American music {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these companies do not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by up to}} three artificially intelligent squadmates, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> given tactical orders such as holding a position, taking cover or rushing enemies. Squadmates may be commanded as a group or individually; for example, one half of a squad {{may be used to}} distract enemies while the other half attacks an objective. Each squad member specializes in weapons, reconnaissance, repairs, demolitions or electronics. Those in the latter four categories may be given special commands, such as repairing a teammate's armor or setting explosive charges. During missions, squad members radio in enemy sightings and status assessments.|$|E

5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo ID cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E

In some of the prints, a woman standing back from the window looks down on him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir Thomas de Veil, {{who was a member of}} Hogarth's first Lodge, Henry Fielding's predecessor as the Bow Street magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in The Coffee-House Politician (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he was known to be an enthusiastic drinker.

Along the way, he meets Maru, daughter of one of the great sages, and Jairo, a thief who initially steals a crucial item from them, but who ultimately decides to help. As they enlist the sages' help, they learn of a wand {{that could be used to}} defeat Jabou, but are at a loss as to how to retrieve it, as it was recently destroyed by Jabou. Soon after, they find themselves many years in the past by the actions of a stranger, and are able to retrieve the wand there.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.|$|E
