All the proceeds from Avon's necklace campaign were donated to Refuge and Women's Aid. In March 2013 Dixon led a walk down Westminster Bridge to the Houses of Parliament to raise awareness of domestic violence. Regarding the walk, Dixon commented that [...] "awareness of domestic violence is still shockingly low and that's why it's so important that <b>we</b> <b>raise</b> awareness about a subject that is too often ignored".|$|E

2500|$|In May 1932, Copeland {{made her}} maiden speech on import duties, which she {{approached}} [...] "entirely {{from the point}} of view of the pottery industry". It was an industry under threat from foreign competition and she welcomed the protection that tariffs afforded. She believed that overseas manufacturers paid starvation wages to their workers, and it was with a critical eye on the opposition benches that she asked:"Can we allow goods manufactured under those conditions to come into this country and lower the standard of living of our own people? I say 'no', and I firmly believe that, if <b>we</b> <b>raise</b> these tariffs, the time will come when our industry will be on its feet again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth-century Gladstone's {{economic}} policies came to be admired by Thatcherite Conservatives. Margaret Thatcher proclaimed in 1983: [...] "We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece <b>we</b> <b>raise</b> in taxation is spent wisely and well. For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping—indeed, I would not mind betting that if Mr Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party". In 1996, she said: [...] "The kind of Conservatism which he and I...favoured would be best described as 'liberal', in the old-fashioned sense. And I mean the liberalism of Mr Gladstone, not of the latter-day collectivists". Nigel Lawson, one of Thatcher's Chancellors, believed Gladstone to be the [...] "greatest Chancellor of all time".|$|E

[...] In a follow-up interview with the Associated Press, Nye said, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>raise</b> a generation of students who don't believe in the process of science, who think everything that we've come to know about nature and the universe can be dismissed by a few sentences translated into English from some ancient text, you're not going to continue to innovate."

Bose left India in 1919 for England with a promise to his father that he would appear in the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination. He went to study in Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge and matriculated on 19 November 1919. He came fourth in the ICS examination and was selected, {{but he did not}} want to work under an alien government which would mean serving the British.
