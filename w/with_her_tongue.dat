5|$|Back at home, {{the family}} is happy to see Meg, who admits remembering nothing between the {{proposal}} and being in a French hospital. Lois tells Meg that they found Ruth <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> cut out. Peter states that he has saved Meg's mail then reveals {{that to be a}} joke as Meg had not received any mail.|$|E
500|$|Out of {{the surface}} of her (Durga's) forehead, fierce with frown, issued {{suddenly}} Kaali of terrible countenance, armed with a sword and noose. Bearing the strange khatvanga (skull-topped staff [...] ), decorated with a garland of skulls, clad in a tiger's skin, very appalling owing to her emaciated flesh, with gaping mouth, fearful <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> lolling out, having deep reddish eyes, filling the regions of the sky with her roars, falling upon impetuously and slaughtering the great asuras in that army, she devoured those hordes of the foes of the devas.|$|E
500|$|Audrey, meanwhile, {{has begun}} working at her father's {{department}} store, {{in a position}} both Laura and Pulaski occupied before their abduction. Audrey spies on another coworker being showered with gifts and offered a job in [...] "hospitality" [...] by the store's manager, and later finds both Laura's and Pulaski's names in the manager's private ledger. Having found an address for One Eyed Jacks, Audrey visits and applies under a false name. The brothel's madam, Blackie O'Reilly (Victoria Catlin) is hesitant to hire her but is convinced when Audrey ties a cherry stem in a knot <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
60|$|All gazed and not far distant beheld a {{scene that}} touched their hearts. On the rocks lay the dead lion and over him stood his mate, licking his face <b>with</b> <b>her</b> rough <b>tongue.</b>|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. Alas! he deluded <b>her</b> <b>with</b> his <b>tongue,</b> and feigned reformation.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{being able}} to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked Liddy to stay and breakfast <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> The <b>tongue</b> of the more childish woman still ran upon recent events. [...] "Are you going across to the church, ma'am?" [...] she asked.|$|R
500|$|The popular [...] "cherry stem" [...] {{scene was}} {{inspired}} by an incident in Peyton's life; he had been dining with friends during {{the time he was}} writing the script when a female friend demonstrated to the group that she could knot a cherry stem <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> Peyton immediately added this to the script, finding it fascinating that he could witness something on one day, write it the next, and two weeks later see newspapers discussing his version of it. Fenn has admitted that she was unable to actually perform the trick, simply switching the stem for a tied one already hidden in her mouth; however, co-star Mädchen Amick has since demonstrated it during television interviews.|$|E
500|$|Sil first {{tries to}} mate with a man she meets at a nightclub (Anthony Guidera), but after sensing that he is diabetic, she rejects him. Unsatisfied, he [...] tries to rape her, {{prompting}} her to kill him by puncturing his skull <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> She then tries {{to mate with}} John Carey (Whip Hubley), a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's pool where Sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a bipedal mutant with tentacles on her shoulders and back, and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman (Marliese K. Schneider) in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan to stake out the Nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase. She fakes her death by crashing the car, which she has previously filled with gasoline containers, into a high-voltage transformer, using the kidnapped woman as a stand-in for her own body.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Donna Gooden acts as, {{among other}} things, the town's {{veterinarian}} and medical examiner. On Twin Peaks, Laura's best friend was named Donna, and Donna's father, Dr. Hayward, {{was also the}} town doctor and medical examiner. While drinking a Cherry Coke, Maudette states, [...] "Isn't cherry the best?" [...] Sherilyn Fenn, the actress who portrays Maudette, famously tied a cherry stem into a knot <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> in Twin Peaks. Later, Ray Wise suddenly has white hair, just as his Twin Peaks character Leland Palmer's hair turned white overnight in one episode. Dual Spires {{is famous for its}} cinnamon pie and apple cider, as Twin Peaks was famous for cherry pie and [...] "damn fine" [...] coffee. The mayor of Dual Spires is named Douglas Fir, and the town of Twin Peaks was filled with Douglas-fir trees. The local paper in Dual Spires is [...] "The Great Northern," [...] while Twin Peaks had a hotel called the Great Northern. In both series, there are stacks of donuts at the police station. In both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks, a sawmill was the source of the town's livelihood and burned down in a case of arson. Paula Merral is found wrapped in plastic by the lake, just as in Twin Peaks Laura Palmer's body was found [...] "dead, wrapped in plastic" [...] on a rocky beach. The Barkers have a framed prom photo of their niece wearing a tiara prominently displayed, and a similar photo of Laura Palmer remains the iconic Twin Peaks image. Leo the cinnamon owl was the festival mascot, whereas the character of Leo Johnson was suspected of Laura Palmer's murder in Twin Peaks. Owls were a major part of Peaks as well. The pet bird in Dr. Gooden's waiting room was the same type of bird that bit Laura's shoulder in Twin Peaks. There is similar camera work and sound effect focus on a ceiling fan whipping around {{at the top of the}} stairs at Sheriff Jackson's house; this happened often in Twin Peaks. The sheriff's house also looks similar to the Palmers' house. Paula secretly dated the sheriff's son and shared [...] "secret special lover earrings" [...] with him, and in Twin Peaks, Laura and the nephew of one of the townsmen each had half of a golden heart necklace. A local teenage boy wears a jeweled crown. In Peaks, Audrey Horne's older brother wore a Native American headdress. In both series, the sheriff's deputy is a Native American who is very in tune with nature. Sheriff Andrew Jackson's name references the seventh president of the United States, just as the name of the sheriff of Twin Peaks, Harry Truman, references the 33rd. Shawn and Gus find a book written by Earl Wyndam; in Peaks, Windom Earle was a psychopathic ex-FBI agent.|$|E
50|$|During Cecil's tenure, Benjo {{became more}} {{suspicious}} and watchful. What he feared came one morning {{before going to}} his school: he witnessed Cecil {{who was about to}} eat his little baby sister <b>with</b> <b>her</b> long <b>tongue.</b> Still, the boy obeyed his mother not to say anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is Sihamba {{and no one}} else," [...] said Sigwe. [...] "Sihamba {{come back}} to rule you in the hour of need, and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> own <b>tongue</b> she shall tell you her story {{and the story of}} the White Swallow who holds her by the hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had {{not reached}} him at my heart [...] <b>With</b> <b>her</b> fine <b>tongue,</b> as snakes indeed [...] Kill flies; nor had I, for my part, [...] Yearned after, in my desperate need, [...] And {{followed}} {{him as he}} did her [...] To coasts left bitter by the tide, [...] Whose very nightingales, elsewhere [...] Delighting, torture and deride! [...] For still they sing, the nightingales.|$|R
2500|$|Rihanna {{created a}} Facebook {{campaign}} page entitled [...] "Rihanna: UNLOCKED" [...] , whereby her fans on Facebook are given missions to complete, {{in the form}} of games, in order to [...] "unlock" [...] new information about the album. Upon the unveiling of the standard edition's artwork, both James Dinh of MTV and a reviewer for NME commented that Rihanna looks [...] "seductive" [...] in the image. Gordon Smart of The Sun humorously criticized the standard edition artwork by saying that it looks as though the singer is trying to cover up a cold sore <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> writing [...] "It's easy to pick them up {{at this time of year}} – especially as she's constantly naked or attached to her new boyfriend Dudley O'Shaughnessy by the lips." ...|$|E
60|$|She hesitated, {{moistening}} her frightened lips <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> then braved {{her eyes}} to his and proceeded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, no! {{very quick}} in her temper and sharp <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> But {{then she has}} a good deal to try her, as I happen to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush, Mary!' ejaculated her husband; but {{he might}} as well have tried to stop a torrent. 'Ay, I know. She comes round every man of you <b>with</b> <b>her</b> smooth <b>tongue</b> and pretty face, till you--you are ready to take her part against your own child, Underwood. When my poor girl's laid in her coffin, then you will know what a serpent you've been fostering.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} quit you, ma'am, {{now that you}} are married?" [...] Ann Sidley timidly asked; for, {{although}} she could scarcely think such an event {{within the bounds of}} probability, and Eve had already more than once assured her of the contrary <b>with</b> <b>her</b> own <b>tongue,</b> still did she love to have assurance made doubly sure. [...] "I hope nothing will ever happen to make me quit you, ma'am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now not {{far from}} the music master's house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma. She was such a little dear altogether, and blinked her eyes so daintily, and ate her supper so tidily, and when she had {{finished}} she licked her pink nose so delicately <b>with</b> <b>her</b> little <b>tongue,</b> that <b>her</b> mistress was never tired of saying, 'Koma, Koma, what should I do without you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, this is away up in {{the swell}} part. My, ain't you comin' on!" [...] Mary clucked <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> [...] "You'll be calling on the Lake Drive soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--a difference--what a difference! When {{you have}} a little more flesh--then--" [...] Madame made a slight click <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b> [...] "What a good brooch, eh?" [...] Madame fingered the brooch. [...] "Old paste--old paste--antique--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Nor did he deposit Maria to {{the ground}} {{until he reached the}} door of Ben Isaje's house; here, when the mevrouw began to belabour him <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> and with her fists, he turned appealingly to Gilda: ...|$|E
5000|$|Dev - Ram's spoiled son. He is a worrisome boy who grows {{into a man}} who {{has broken}} no ties to his petulant childhood. He {{continues}} to pull [...] "teenage pranks" [...] well into middle age, expects to be given everything in life without having to work for it, and most of all he greatly resents his stepmother Rose. He still feels that she is an unwelcome presence in the house, supplanting his mother and causing nothing but trouble <b>with</b> <b>her</b> uninhibited <b>tongue.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are {{so unlike}} those I live with,' said Georgina sadly, {{as an excuse}} for the distrust. 'Oh, you don't know what I have gone through, or you would pity me. You are the only thing that has not failed me. There is Jane, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> smooth <b>tongue</b> and {{universal}} obligingness, she is the most selfish creature in existence--her heart would go into a nutshell! One grain of sympathy, and I would never have married. It was all her doing--she wanted luxuries! O Theodora, if I had but been near you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Prendergast {{looked so}} much shocked that Lucilla felt a blush rising, {{conscious}} that {{the tone of}} the society she had of late lived <b>with</b> had rendered <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> less guarded, <b>her</b> cheek less shamefaced than erst, but she galloped on to hide her confusion. 'You were their great cause. If you had not gone and frightened her, they might have philandered on all this time, till the whole affair died of its own silliness.' ...|$|R
60|$|Pris took it very well; laughing, and {{blushing}} {{just enough}} to make her appear the loveliest creature I had ever laid eyes on. She shook her head very much as my sister had done not long before, and disclaimed the analogy, first in her manner, and next <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Ridley {{gave her}} a piece of advice. [...] "Do not be daunted at my lady; her bark is ever worse than her bite, and what she will not bear with is the seeming cowed before her. She is all the sharper <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> now that her heart is sore for Master Bernard." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Bayard now looked really startled, and a {{good deal}} astonished, {{questioning}} me with her very fine eyes, though she said nothing <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> of Coejemans, who bears this appellation, and who has contracted to get the necessary surveys made, though he fills the humble post of a 'chainbearer' himself, not being competent to make the calculations.|$|E
60|$|Poor Mrs. Quiverful {{was ready}} enough <b>with</b> <b>her</b> own <b>tongue</b> in accusing <b>her</b> husband {{to his face}} of being soft, and perhaps did not always speak of him to her {{children}} quite so respectfully as she might have done. But she did {{not at all like}} to hear him abused by others, and began to vindicate him and to explain that of course he had taken Mr. Slope to be an emissary from Mrs. Proudie herself; that Mr. Slope was thought to be peculiarly her friend; and that, therefore, Mr. Quiverful would have been failing in respect to her had he assumed to doubt what Mr. Slope had said.|$|R
50|$|Robichaud {{observed}} that the captive female was calm {{in the presence of}} humans, but was afraid of dogs. On an encounter with a dog, she would resort to snorting and thrust her head forward, pointing her horns at her opponent. Her erect ears pointed backward, and she stood stiffly <b>with</b> <b>her</b> back arched. Meanwhile, she hardly paid any attention to her surroundings. This female was found to urinate and defecate separately, dropping her hind legs and lowering her lower body - a common observation among bovids. She would spend considerable time grooming herself <b>with</b> <b>her</b> strong <b>tongue.</b> Marking behaviour in the female involved opening up the flap of the maxillary gland and leaving a pungent secretion on rocks and vegetation. She would give out short bleats occasionally.|$|R
6000|$|The {{good old}} gentleman, {{who had been}} the benefactor to them all, was greatly {{concerned}} at it, and the good woman his wife was grieved beyond all expressing, and begged her ladyship (meaning Amy), not to resent it; they promised, too, they would talk <b>with</b> <b>her</b> about it, and the old gentlewoman added, with some astonishment, [...] "Sure she cannot be such a fool but she will be prevailed <b>with</b> to hold <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> when she has it from your own mouth that you are not her mother, and sees that it disobliges your ladyship to have her insist upon it." [...] And so Amy came away with some expectation that it would be stopped here.|$|R
6000|$|... "So you did. She's {{never tried}} to lay a finger on me and I ain't never told a lie to her--not one, true's you live. She combs me down <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> {{sometimes}} though, but that just slips off ME like water off a duck's back. Say, Una, why didn't you {{hang on to the}} muff?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then she {{marched to}} the one {{washstand}} in the room, tilted her head {{this way and that}} before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it, dampened her fingers <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> perfected the circle of a little lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, then began to busy herself with the slops.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] said Lady Anne, in a breathless voice--she was {{as white}} as death, and {{moistened}} her lips <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>tongue</b> before she spoke--"father, thou wilt not do harm to this young man. Spare him, I do beseech thee, for truly it was I who bade him come hither. I know {{that he would not}} have come but at our bidding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the book}} is mainly in Russian, {{significant}} portions of dialogue are in French. It {{has been suggested that}} the use of French is a deliberate literary device, to portray artifice while Russian emerges as a language of sincerity, honesty, and seriousness. [...] It could, however, also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which {{the book is}} written, since French was the common language of the Russian aristocracy at the time. In fact, the Russian nobility often knew only enough Russian to command their servants; Tolstoy illustrates this by showing that Julie Karagina, a character in the novel, is so unfamiliar <b>with</b> <b>her</b> native <b>tongue</b> that she has to take Russian lessons.|$|R
5000|$|The Chronicler, Thomas Walsingham, claimed Alice was the illegitimate {{daughter}} of an Essex tiler and a tavern whore, suggesting she only enchanted Edward through sorcery and magic: a common explanation in the Middle Ages for beautiful women who captured the heart of kings. She was described as [...] "extremely ugly" [...] and ruling the king through flattery, a seductive voice and supernatural powers explaining accusations of witchcraft on her behalf. However, Charles Lethbridge Kingsford states that she most probably was the {{daughter of}} Sir Richard Perrers, and enticed the King <b>with</b> <b>her</b> clever <b>tongue.</b> However he dismisses the claims she was [...] "extremely ugly" [...] as the King was certainly known to like clever and attractive women, attributes Alice had in abundance.|$|R
40|$|A healthy girl of 10 years {{presented}} <b>with</b> lumps on <b>her</b> <b>tongue,</b> {{shown on}} biopsy to be neuromas. She had had operations {{to her feet}} for pes cavus and was relatively long-limbed but had no other 'Marfanoid' features. She had a high plasma calcitonin level. At operation a normal sized thyroid gland was totally removed. It contained two discrete masses of malignant C-cells and diffuse foci elsewhere. The plasma calcitonin fell slowly to normal on follow-up but was noted to be rising 2 1 / 2 years later. We {{stress the importance of}} making this diagnosis as early as possible and mention briefly another child aged 15 months, similarly diagnosed and operated upon...|$|R
