5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> on a log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|The assailants were {{apparently}} targeting Rami Amira, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> {{at a table}} nearby with Moti Hassin and Simantov Hatayeb, who are all identified with the Abergil group, {{in an effort to}} resolve an internal dispute. Amira sustained a slight injury in his cheek {{as a result of the}} attack. He was killed on 2 February 2011 in Rishon Letzion, presumably by the Abergil organization which, according to police sources, continued to operate while the two Abergil brothers were extradited and awaiting trial in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{most heavily}} {{promoted}} feud {{going into the}} event was between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. At Royal Rumble 1995, Bigelow teamed with Tatanka {{in the final round}} of a tournament for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Bigelow was pinned {{at the end of the}} match, which led to the crowd heckling him. He responded by pushing NFL player Lawrence Taylor, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> at ringside. Bigelow refused to apologize and instead challenged Taylor to a wrestling match. Taylor agreed and trained with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel to prepare for the match. The storyline between Bigelow and Taylor brought the WWF much mainstream exposure, as the match was discussed by several news outlets.|$|E

5|$|Several storylines from Royal Rumble 1995 {{were carried}} over to WrestleMania XI, the WWF's next pay-per-view. Bam Bam Bigelow {{attacked}} National Football League Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in the crowd; this {{set up a}} match between the two at WrestleMania. Pamela Anderson was at ringside and was supposed to accompany {{the winner of the}} Royal Rumble match to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Although Shawn Michaels won the match, Anderson came to the ring at WrestleMania with Diesel. The Undertaker's feud with Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation also escalated, as DiBiase's men stole the urn that was said to give The Undertaker his power. Jarrett and Ramon continued to feud for several months, and Bret Hart targeted Bob Backlund because of Backlund's interference in the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match.|$|E
5|$|Sheila Mae Damude {{and her son}} Darin Jon Damude {{came from}} Saanich, British Columbia, Canada. She was an {{administrator}} at the Pacific Christian School in Victoria, while Darin was a college student. They had come to Thailand on holiday, with Darin flying to Asia first before Sheila met him in Bangkok during spring break. They flew to Phuket on 15 March with Martin (still using his assumed name) <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in the same row as them. He befriended the two and they checked into Nilly's Marina Inn facing Patong Beach. Martin was given Room 48 and the Damudes were given the adjacent Room 43. The Damudes were not seen again after they ate breakfast the next morning; at about 11a.m. THA (5a.m. UTC), Martin asked the inn's receptionist to switch his room to Room 43, saying that the Damudes had left {{and that he would}} pay their bill.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E
25|$|Next, 33 wrestlers {{competed in}} the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, {{including}} previously unannounced participants Kalisto, Sin Cara, Luke Harper, Titus O'Neil, The Vaudevillains (Simon Gotch and Aiden English), and The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor). In the climax, Jinder Mahal taunted New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> at ringside. This prompted Gronkowski to enter the ring and shove Mahal. Mojo Rawley then eliminated Mahal to win the match.|$|E

Nine of the sixteen passengers {{and five of}} the eight crew lost their lives. Adnan Menderes, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in the back part of the aircraft, survived the accident.|$|E
25|$|Miss Elizabeth {{disappeared}} from WWF television until WrestleMania VII, when Savage lost a retirement match to The Ultimate Warrior. Upon his loss, Sherri began beating and kicking the defeated Savage until Elizabeth, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> at ringside, entered {{the ring and}} defended Savage. Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair and threw {{her out of the}} ring, reuniting Savage and Elizabeth. Macho Man punctuated the reunion by holding down the ropes for Elizabeth after years of her doing it for him.|$|E
25|$|During {{the speech}} former General {{secretary}} Jiang Zemin seemed very tired, was constantly yawning, {{and was not}} paying much attention.

Hong Kong media noted that Jiang left the Great Hall without shaking anyone's hand, {{and that no one}} came up to shake his. Surprisingly, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng also attended the Congress as a delegate. All the surviving members of the 14th and 15th PSC's were present, including former Premiers Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, but with the exception of Jiang rival Qiao Shi.|$|E

Eli, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> {{at the foot of}} the doorpost in the sanctuary at Shiloh, saw her apparently mumbling to herself and thought she was drunk, but was soon assured of her motivation and sobriety. Eli was the priest of Shiloh, and one of the last Israelite Judges before the rule of kings in ancient Israel. He had assumed the leadership after Samson's death. Eli blessed her and she returned home. Subsequently Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to Samuel.|$|E
25|$|Lawson in the 1890s {{records that}} a young lady once fell over the cliff near Craig Na'an; however, her Victorian style {{garments}} caught the wind like a parachute and she escaped with her life and some broken bones that soon knit back together. A visitor in a group from Stranraer was not so lucky and fell to his death on his way down from the summit. A shocking death {{was that of a}} lad from Girvan <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> amongst loose rocks, pulling out stones and throwing them into the sea when a very large boulder started to move and crushed him. The stone was too heavy to shift and help from the mainland was required to extract the body of the unfortunate victim. In 1887 a ten-year-old boy died whilst collecting eggs at the West Craigs.|$|E
25|$|Standing {{in a large}} atrium, Roberts {{first opened}} fire at the mall's food court that was across from him at his left. The first to be shot was 54-year-old shopper Cindy Ann Yuille, a hospice nurse {{and mother of two}} who was shot in the back; she died despite efforts of {{bystanders}} to treat her wound. 15-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, who was walking through the mall with her friend to reach the Town Center MAX station, was the second person to be shot; she received a bullet to the chest, but she survived and made it out of the mall, where she was treated for her gunshot wound. The final victim was 46-year-old father of two and youth sports coach Steven Forsyth, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> by a rented kiosk and talking with his father on his cell phone when he {{was shot in the head}} and killed.|$|E

25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E
25|$|Iolanthe premiered {{only three}} days after Patience closed at the Savoy. The Savoy Theatre, opened only a year earlier, was a {{state-of-the-art}} facility, the first theatre {{in the world to}} be lit entirely by electricity. Patience had transferred to the Savoy from the Opera Comique, upon the theatre's opening, but Iolanthe was the first show to premiere at the theatre. New lighting technologies made such special effects as sparkling fairy wands possible for the first time. The principal fairies' heads were also lit by wreaths of small illuminated stars attached to a battery. The audience that attended the opening night in London included Captain (later Captain Sir) Eyre Massey Shaw, head of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, whom the Fairy Queen apostrophises in the second act ("Oh, Captain Shaw / Type of true love kept under / Could thy brigade with cold cascade / Quench my great love, I wonder?").

25|$|In , {{the rivalry}} hit {{an all-time high}} when Darcy Tucker {{attacked}} the Senators' Chris Neil, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> on the bench. This resulted in numerous players exchanging punches before order was restored. Tucker, Neil and Shane Hnidy all received fighting majors and game misconducts for the same incident. After the game, Tucker claimed Neil spit on him, an allegation which Neil denied. The NHL board looked into this claim and concluded that Tucker's allegation was false. Tempers remained frayed, especially with 1:23 to play, when Toronto's Tie Domi went after Magnus Arvedson and threw several punches at Arvedson. Video evidence showed Arvedson spearing Domi just prior, awaiting the faceoff. Domi received a roughing minor, instigator minor, fighting major, misconduct and game misconduct. Arvedson {{did not get a}} penalty on the play. Suspensions were announced a few hours after Tucker and Domi appeared at NHL head offices in Toronto for a hearing. Tucker was suspended for five games, without pay, after it was determined that Neil did not spit at Toronto's bench. Domi was suspended for three games, also without pay. A total of 163 minutes in penalties were called in the game.|$|E
