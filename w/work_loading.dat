In Group 1, ejection fraction decreased from 49 ± 18 % (mean ± standard deviation) at rest to 43 ± 16 % at symptom-limited exercise, and then increased to 52 ± 21 % during <b>work</b> <b>load</b> reduction (p < 0. 001). In Group 2, ejection fraction decreased from 53 ± 18 % at rest to 44 ± 16 % at symptom-limited exercise, and then increased to 52 ± 19 % during <b>work</b> <b>load</b> reduction (p < 0. 001). If the ejection fraction response during <b>work</b> <b>load</b> reduction rather than during symptom-limited exercise was considered for diagnostic purposes, the sensitivity would have been reduced from 100 to 52 % in Group 1 and to 70 % in Group 2. The ejection fraction increased during <b>work</b> <b>load</b> reduction despite persistent ST segment depression in eight patients in Group 1 and in nine patients in Group 2. Increases in ejection fraction during <b>work</b> <b>load</b> reduction were associated with increases in the ratio of systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume and lessening of regional wall motion abnormalities.

The participants were 61 female nurses aged 23 - 59, who worked in a public psychiatric hospital in Ishikawa, Japan.

The NJSS has seven subscales: conflict with other nursing staff, nursing role conflict, conflict with physicians or autonomy, conflict with death or dying, quantitative <b>work</b> <b>load,</b> qualitative <b>work</b> <b>load</b> and conflict with patients. Factors influencing NK cell activity, and the proportion and cell counts of CD 16 + 56 + lymphocytes were evaluated.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aims of {{the study}} were to 1) assess the effects of 12 weeks of {{exercise}} training at low <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> (i. e., corresponding to ≤ 50 % of peak oxygen consumption [Vo 2]) on peak Vo 2 and hyperemic calf blood flow in patients with severe congestive heart failure; and 2) evaluate left ventricular diastolic pressure and wall stress during exercise performed at <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> corresponding to ≤ 50 % and 70 % to 80 % of peak Vo 2. Background. Whether the benefits of exercise training can be achieved at <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> that result in lower left ventricular diastolic wall stress than those associated with conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> is unknown in patients with severe congestive heart failure. Methods. Sixteen patients with severe congestive heart failure trained at low <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> for 1 h/day, four times a week, for 12 weeks. Peak Vo 2 and calf and forearm reactive hyperemia were measured before and during training. Nine of the 16 patients underwent right heart catheterization and echocardiography during bicycle exercise at low and conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> (i. e., 50 % and 70 % to 80 % of peak Vo 2, respectively). Results. The increase in left ventricular diastolic wall stress was substantially lower during exercise at low <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> than during exercise at conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads,</b> (i. e., [mean ± SEM] 23. 3 ± 7. 4 vs. 69. 6 ± 8. 1 dynes/cm 2 (p < 0. 001). After 6 and 12 weeks of training, peak Vo 2 increased from 11. 5 ± 0. 4 to 14. 0 ± 0. 5 and 15. 0 ± 0. 5 ml/kg per min, respectively (p < 0. 0001 vs. baseline for both). Peak reactive hyperemia significantly increased in the calf but not in the forearm. The increases in peak Vo 2 and calf peak reactive hyperemia correlated closely (r = 0. 61, p < 0. 02). Conclusions. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, peak Vo 2 is enhanced by exercise training at <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> that result in smaller increases in left ventricular diastolic wall stress than those observed at conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads.</b> (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 597 – 603...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{care workers}} {{have a high}} {{prevalence}} of low back pain (LBP). Although physical exposures in the working environment are linked to {{an increased risk of}} LBP, {{it has been suggested that}} individual coping strategies, for example fear-avoidance beliefs, could also be important in the development and maintenance of LBP. Accordingly, the main objective of this study was to examine (1) the association between physical <b>work</b> <b>load</b> and LBP, (2) the predictive effect of fear-avoidance beliefs on the development of LBP, and (3) the moderating effect of fear-avoidance beliefs on the association between physical <b>work</b> <b>load</b> and LBP among cases with and without previous LBP. Methods A questionnaire survey among 5696 newly qualified health care workers who completed a baseline questionnaire shortly before completing their education and a follow-up questionnaire 12 months later. Participants were selected on the following criteria: (a) being female, (b) working in the health care sector (n = 2677). Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of physical <b>work</b> <b>load</b> and fear-avoidance beliefs on the severity of LBP. Results For those with previous LBP, physical <b>work</b> <b>load</b> has an importance, but not among those without previous LBP. In relation to fear-avoidance beliefs, there is a positive relation between it and LBP of than 30 days in both groups, i. e. those without and with previous LBP. No moderating effect of fear-avoidance beliefs on the association between physical <b>work</b> <b>load</b> and LBP was found among cases with and without LBP.
