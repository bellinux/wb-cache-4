Richie uses {{the opportunity to make}} amends with Joey. A member of the Ducky Boys interrupts the game, as the Wanderers momentarily turn their heads, hundreds of Ducky Boys invade the field. Many of the Wanderers and the Del Bombers flee, but some stand their ground. The remaining players join forces with spectator gangs in the stands, including one called the Wongs and even Emilio. After a long and bloody battle, the Ducky Boys flee.|$|E
5|$|Operation Kugown was {{the name}} given to the {{psychological}} warfare operation that had played {{an important part in}} the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the Comite, so that the local agency could receive some credit. The Comite also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad ("Later <b>We</b> <b>Discover</b> the Truth"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.|$|E
25|$|After {{a cluster}} has become gravitationally unbound, {{many of its}} {{constituent}} stars will still be moving through space on similar trajectories, in {{what is known as}} a stellar association, moving cluster, or moving group. Several of the brightest stars in the 'Plough' of Ursa Major are former members of an open cluster which now form such an association, in this case, the Ursa Major Moving Group. Eventually their slightly different relative velocities will see them scattered throughout the galaxy. A larger cluster is then known as a stream, if <b>we</b> <b>discover</b> the similar velocities and ages of otherwise unrelated stars.|$|E

For the chemical decomposition of NaBH 4 and NH 3 BH 3 <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> possible x-ray induced hydrogen gas generation; for the decomposition of HMX and RDX, <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> that the decay rates of these two materials vary with pressure respectively; for the study of FOX- 7 ’s high pressure behaviors <b>we</b> <b>discovered</b> potential phase changes and pressure induced chemical reactions as pressure is increased...|$|R
25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, {{most of whom are}} young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job is to treat patients and that beds must be allocated to the ones {{who are most likely to}} survive and get better. <b>We</b> <b>discover</b> that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.|$|E
25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism <b>we</b> <b>discover</b> a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E

Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E

500|$|David-Lloyd {{described}} the character's {{development in the}} third series as [...] "really exciting". He {{felt that it was}} [...] "great to be a fully-fledged member of the team now rather than just the administration man." [...] He felt flattered to have the writer and producers put so much confidence in him. In this series, the writers also explore Jones's background; David-Lloyd was happy with the execution of this backstory, through meeting Ianto's sister, and commented that it was quite beautifully written. Through meeting his family, <b>we</b> <b>discover</b> that his father has died and that Ianto has grown very distant from his relatives as per the demands of his job. David-Lloyd first concluded that Ianto was being killed off when his agent told him he was only needed for four out of five episodes. Although there was [...] "a bit of disappointment", he considers himself [...] "lucky" [...] for lasting so long on the series, especially since Ianto was supposed to die in series two. He believed the character's death was justified by [...] "the impact and the drama, and to keep the dangerous reality of Torchwood ever present". Although it was [...] "a tragedy that [...] died", David-Lloyd felt that the series had [...] "addressed everything about him that needed to be said".|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that <b>we</b> <b>discover</b> in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
