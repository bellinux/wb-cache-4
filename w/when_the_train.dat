5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> fails {{to make it}} {{over the top of}} the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.|$|E
5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in a vertical position {{in order to}} allow riders to board. Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E

5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 1952, Cluverius was {{returning}} by train from a Navy reunion in Philadelphia {{when he became}} so seriously ill that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> stopped in New Haven {{he was taken to}} hospital, where he died. The last surviving officer of the USS Maine, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, with his wife Hannah, who died in 1938. He was survived by his two daughters and his son.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the line to open for {{temporary}} operation was between Flekkefjord and Moi on 1October 1904. For the official opening, the town of Flekkefjord was adorned with Norwegian flags. A train departed to Egersund on 31October 1904 with several notable passengers: Prime Minister Francis Hagerup, State Railways director Elias Sunde and board member Sven Aarrestad, director of traffic Jens Christian Mellbye, Flekkefjord's mayor and city council as well as other mayors of the district. Festivities continued on the next day, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> returned from Egersund to Flekkefjord.|$|E

30|$|Age {{estimation}} {{techniques can}} be evaluated using {{mean absolute error}} (MAE) or cumulative score (CS). MAE is appropriate <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> set {{has a lot of}} missing ages while CS is used <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> dataset has samples at almost every age. Overall performance of the system is represented by CS. In practice, both MAE and CS are used because different techniques and datasets may be biased for evaluation. The most often used evaluation protocols are LOPO and Cross-Validation.|$|R
5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown on the {{aircraft}} carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister {{on a visit}} to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is stationary or approaching a railway station.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter {{in the direction of}} the camera during the first half of the film <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, 1947, the Kings County {{council in}} New York City of the Army and Navy Union {{under the command}} of General Samuel Hoch made {{available}} an escort party for the families who were having their soldier dead brought home from World War II. The organization participants gathered at the Flatbush Post of the American Legion on Nostrand Ave at 9 AM to get their instructions from Hoch. He also coordinated the Brooklyn Naval Yard Garrison of the organization later, that participated in the Freedom Train Brooklyn display at the Vanderveer Park freight yards of the Long Island Rail Road. There were thousands that saw the one-day Brooklyn event that displayed Americana and original nineteenth-century historical documents in the rail cars. Many were not able to get to see the displays that day and planned on viewing the next day <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> would stop a few miles away at Jamaica, Queens, New York.|$|E
5|$|Posing as a nurse, Eva wheels Diabolik past {{groups of}} people. He sneaks into the morgue where Valmont's {{body has been}} cremated, {{collects}} the eleven emeralds from his ashes and escapes. The police discover that Diabolik is still alive and offer a million-dollar reward for him. He reacts by blowing up the tax offices. Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it difficult to steal, and the block is loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck on the tracks and re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed. It explodes <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> arrives and the gold falls into the water below. Diabolik and Eva collect it and return it to their hideout.|$|E
5|$|The Governor's Daughter is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story details a convict who is being sent to prison <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is wrecked and the sheriff escorting him is killed. The convict frees himself, but halts his escape {{to save the life}} of a little girl. As he returns the girl to her nurse, a policeman identifies and recaptures him. Later the little girl accompanies her father, the governor, on a tour of the prison and the father pardons the hero-convict. The film included scenes of a real train wreck and the scenario was written around the filming of the disaster. The film received praise for the before and after scenes which were described as shocking to The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer. The film was released on June 24, 1910, and was shown as far away as Australia. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

MAE is a good evaluation technique <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> set has a lot of missing ages. However, in age estimation, both MAE and CS are used since different techniques, datasets, and systems may be extremely imbalanced or skewed for evaluation.|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{crossed into}} Poland, he tells them, {{it was taken}} over by the Gestapo, the German secret police. The Jews were {{transferred}} to trucks, then driven to a forest in Galicia, near Kolomaye, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. He tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, the tailor who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would not listen, making Moshe Night's first unheeded witness.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E

5|$|At {{the railway}} station in Belgrade, Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death {{to one of}} his sons, and asks for an agent from Station Y to meet him at Zagreb. However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> arrives at the station, Grant {{intercepts}} Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a murder-suicide, to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrotte. Bond then drags the comatose Romanova from the train (which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice), where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.|$|E
5|$|The band of robbers, now at home, {{are about}} to start {{splitting}} their stolen goods equally, when the police barge in. While three of the robbers are subdued after a fight, one manages to make his escape via a window and ends up on the roof. The two policeman chase the criminal, who eludes them by jumping from rooftop to rooftop. After the robber jumps down to the street, he runs toward the railroad station and boards a departing train. The police officers arrive but are too late, as the robber has left. The officers tell the train dispatcher to send a telegram to the next station, informing them of the fugitive and asking them to catch {{him as soon as}} possible. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> reaches the next station, the burglar exits the train and unknowingly runs right into the path of policemen. With all four of the robbers caught, they are sentenced to forty years in jail. While doing work in the jail's quarry, the group review their failure, with each robber pinning the blame on another.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{operate at}} a {{frequency}} {{of one to}} two minutes to five to ten minutes between 05:00 and 00:00, depending upon the peak and off-peak hours. Trains operating within the network typically travel at speed up to , and stop for about 20 seconds at each station. Automated station announcements are recorded in Hindi and English. Many stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, cafés, convenience stores and mobile recharge. Eating, drinking, smoking and chewing of gum are prohibited in the entire system. The Metro also has a sophisticated fire alarm system for advance warning in emergencies, and fire retardant material is used in trains {{as well as on}} the premises of stations. Navigation information is available on Google Transit. Since October 2010, the first coach of every train is reserved for women. However, last coaches are also reserved <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> changes tracks at the terminal stations in the Red, Green and Violet Lines.
