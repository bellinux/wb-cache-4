5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> {{in his hand}} and a dog beside his chair; the one at his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly of him in the Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious.|$|E
5|$|When the {{trapdoor}} to {{the cellar}} mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty {{go down to}} investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recorder belonging to the archaeologist who owned it. When Scotty plays it, the archaeologist's voice recites a series of incantations, resurrecting a mysterious, demonic entity. Cheryl becomes increasingly hysterical and locks herself in her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. Meanwhile, Ash gives Linda a silver necklace, which she absolutely loves. Cheryl is then attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. Unable to convince the others of what happened, she asks Ash to take her into town for the night. However, Ash soon discovers that the bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning {{that the only way}} to kill the entity is to dismember it when it possesses a host. Cheryl succumbs to the entity and attacks the others, stabbing Linda in the ankle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> before Scotty is able to force her into the cellar.|$|E
25|$|The {{precision}} grip {{is when the}} intermediate and distal phalanges ("fingertips") and the thumb press against each other.

Note: some mental health professionals only administer phase one or two and may change the writing instrument as desired. Variations of the test may ask the person to draw one person of each sex, or put all drawings on the same page.|$|E
25|$|Gurney {{was educated}} at Macquarie Street State School, where his prowess <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> soon became evident, regaling his classmates with caricatures {{of their faces}} perched atop incongruous bodies. Leaving school at age 13, he found {{employment}} at an ironmonger's shop, followed {{by a couple of}} other jobs, before embarking on an electrical apprenticeship with the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission, in the expectation of becoming an electrical engineer. This entailed taking night classes at Hobart Technical College, but it was not long before his attention was drawn to art classes conducted at the same institution by Lucien Dechaineux (1869–1957).|$|E

25|$|Bascom {{started making}} portraits in 1801 by tracing the shadow {{cast of the}} sitter by lamp- or candlelight on drawing paper placed on a wall in a dark room. At that time, cutting {{profiles}} was a popular parlor game and an inexpensive form of art. She didn't seem to make many portraits {{in the first decade}} or so of the 19th century; she recorded making portraits just seven times between 1801 and 1808, and {{there was no mention of}} profiles again until 1818, when she made them of the recently deceased son and wife of A. Gould. In 1819 she began making profiles in the evenings. The subject's features and other details were drawn <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 2004, American cable {{television}} network TV Land unveiled a life-sized statue of Newhart on the Magnificent Mile {{in his native}} Chicago, depicting Dr. Robert Hartley from The Bob Newhart Show. The statue depicts Dr. Hartley sitting in his therapy practice chair <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> held between his hands, and a patients' sofa next to him. After an initial temporary installation in front of 430 North Michigan Avenue, the building used for exterior establishing shots of Hartley's office, the bronze set is now permanently located in the sculpture park in front of Chicago's Navy Pier entertainment complex.

25|$|The seventh {{match was}} between the team of Sting and Abdullah the Butcher and the team of Brian Pillman and Bobby Eaton. Before the match, Abdullah {{attacked}} Sting with a stick on the entrance ramp. Pillman attacked Abdullah as Eaton attacked Sting. The match started with Sting gaining the advantage with a flying clothesline to Eaton. Abdullah attacked Sting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> until Pillman dropkicked Abdullah. Sting attacked Eaton outside as Pillman performed a front powerslam and a splash to Abdullah. Sting and Eaton fought in the ring until Abdullah and Cactus Jack came in. Jack accidentally hit Abdullah with the stick, and Sting pinned Eaton after a diving crossbody to win the match. After the match, Abdullah fought with Jack.|$|E

25|$|According to George Orwell, {{coal miners}} could develop {{characteristic}} tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo {{occurs when a}} substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound {{as the result of}} some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in to the soft tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos {{is the result of a}} deliberate or accidental stabbing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.|$|E
25|$|Written {{messages}} on plastic slates {{can be used}} to convey complex messages with a low risk of misunderstanding. Slates are available in various sizes and are usually hard white plastic with a matte finish, suitable for writing on <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil.</b> They can be stored in various ways, but in a pocket or bungeed to the wrist are popular methods. Clipped to the diver by a lanyard is another method, but there is a greater risk of entanglement. Slates may be used to record information to be used on the dive, such as decompression schedules, to discuss matters of importance for which hand signals are not sufficient, and to record data collected during the dive. Waterproof paper wet-notes are a compact equivalent, and pre-printed waterproof data-sheets and clip-board are routinely used by scientific divers for recording observations.|$|E
25|$|A Turing {{machine is}} a {{mathematical}} model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, {{but rather as a}} thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.|$|E

500|$|Art Spiegelman {{described}} the artwork as [...] "quirky and ungainly". [...] Though it appears awkward, Green put considerable effort into {{elements such as}} graphical perspective, and draws attention to his craft by depicting himself drawing and by placing the drawing manuals Perspective and Fun <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>Pencil</b> in the backgrounds. In contrast to the mundane tales of Harvey Pekar, another prominent early practitioner of autobiographical comics, Green makes wide use of visual metaphors. [...] In Binky Brown symbols become literal, as when Binky imagines himself becoming a snowball hurtling into Hell or as a fish chased by a police officer who wears a crucifix. [...] The work displays {{a wide array of}} visual techniques: diagrammatic arrows; mock-scholarly documentation; a great variety in panel size, composition, and layout; and a range of contrasting mechanical and organic rendering techniques, such as screentone alongside dense hand-drawn hatching. [...] The symbolic and technical collide where the Virgin Mary becomes the vanishing point of Binky's converging [...] "pecker rays".|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Alain Lieury, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, indicates that working on exercises <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil</b> and paper is {{just as good as}} Brain Age 2 at stimulating the memory. After evaluating ten-year-old children, the survey found [...] "no evidence to support claims in Nintendo's advertising campaign, featuring Nicole Kidman, that users can test and rejuvenate their grey cells". Lieury finds Brain Age 2 acceptable as a game, but considers it charlatanism for Nintendo to claim it as a scientific test, countering the company's assertions that its edutainment products such as Big Brain Academy and Brain Age 2 can improve blood flow to the brain and supposedly improving [...] "practical intelligence". Regarding whether or not brain training games are effective, Graham Lawton of New Scientist wrote, [...] "All things considered, it's hard not to conclude that brain training has been proven to work—under certain circumstances. [...] It's also worth pointing out that no study has shown that brain training makes cognitive abilities any worse." [...] Lawton notes that Nintendo avoids providing evidence that its Brain Age series actually leads to noticeable improvements in brain functions, and that it instead [...] "is careful not to claim that Brain Age is scientifically validated, merely stating that it is an entertainment product 'inspired' by [...] work." ...|$|E
500|$|Kidnapped {{and thrown}} on a plane, they {{land on a}} remote island. They are led by the men in suits through a jungle {{wilderness}} to a large stone temple. The Dean of the Secret Order of Dirty Joke Writers appears from the shadows and leads the group into a large library, where the world's greatest geniuses study. The Dean explains {{that many of the}} world's greatest geniuses have come together to create dirty jokes and tailor jokes to where the need is greatest. The Dean takes them into a dark room. He reveals {{that they will not be}} permitted to leave the island now that they know about the network of joke distribution agents, like the bellhop. They are locked in a jail cell. As a diversion, Peter stabs Cleveland <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pencil.</b> When the guard opens the door to investigate, the prisoners escape. They are recaptured by the Dean and his armed guards immediately. As they are about to be shot by the guards, an old man claims he has just written the world's greatest dirty joke and then suddenly dies. Peter snatches a small piece of paper that the man dropped as he died, containing the joke. The prisoners escape with the joke on a small plane. As they fly over the secret enclave, it is destroyed in a fireball resulting from a burning drapery that Peter had set alight with a candle. Quagmire bemoans that they destroyed the source of all dirty jokes. Joe quickly realize that Peter has best one ever written. Peter, Joe, Cleveland and Quagmire then fly off into the sunset, after finding out the supposed greatest joke ever written is [...] "Guess what? Chicken butt!" ...|$|E
