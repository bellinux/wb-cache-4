The company was responsible for construction a conveyor next to Witton Brook and dredging the brook in from 1922 to 1929. The conveyor was dismantled in 1943. On 13 November 1929, a <b>waste</b> <b>lime</b> main pipe installed by IMI became dislodged at Lovett's point and slid six to twelve feet downstream. Kynoch Ltd began in 1862 when George Kynoch, a Scottish entrepreneur, opened a percussion cap factory at Witton. Once Nobel Industries, including Kynoch Ltd, had merged to form ICI, the original Kynoch factory in Witton became the head office and principal manufacturing base of the 'ICI Metals Division'. In 2003, IMI moved from the Witton site to new headquarters close to Birmingham International Airport.|$|E

Lime ash was used on the upper floors of yeomans houses and in great houses such as Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire, where the upper surface would be buffed to a fine finish using a mixture of egg-white, curdled milk and fish-gelatine.

Carbide lime is an industrial waste from acetylene gas industry which uses limestone in its production. The use of PCC as fillers in paper making can reduce the production cost and improve the paper properties such as opacity and brightness. PCC can be produced from carbide <b>lime</b> <b>waste</b> by ionic sucrose solution method. The sucrose solution of Brix 10 ° was first prepared by dissolving sugar (sucrose) in water followed by dissolution of carbide <b>lime</b> <b>waste</b> in the sucrose solution. The sucrose solution which had turned milky was then filtered to obtain a clear solution known as pregnant solution. The pregnant solution that contained calcium ions was subsequently used to produce PCC by introducing CO 2 gas into the pregnant solution. The process is known as carbonation. The PCC was then used as fillers in paper making. The production of PCC by using calcium hydroxide as starting material was also carried out for comparison purposes. Based on the results, PCC prepared from carbide lime had purity of 98. 14 % while the one prepared from calcium hydroxide had 98. 66 %.

40|$|White lime {{is used in}} many {{industries}} in South Africa but is not produced locally and must be imported. Many technologies have been suggested for the large-scale manufacture of calcium carbonate {{but these are not}} necessarily suitable for application in South Africa. This study investigated a chemical preparation of calcium carbonate combined with biological purification Calcium containing materials from the Pretoria Portland Cement, Lime Division factory at Lime Acres in the Northern Cape were studied as the starting materials for the manufacture. Investigation showed that they contained various impurities, including iron and manganese compounds which were largely responsible for the brown-grey colour of the lime products. Complete dissolution of calcium hydroxide, the purest of the potential starting materials, and subsequent hydroxide precipitation was not successful in removing all iron and manganese. Precipitation with sulfide ions was successfill, decreasing levels of metals to below the detection limit of atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Studies of all potential starting materials revealed that the levels of impurities in the starting material did not have a large effect on levels of impurities in the calcium carbonate produced. It was therefore possible to convert the residual calcium oxide or hydroxide in <b>waste</b> <b>lime</b> dusts to white calcium carbonate, a marketable prciduct Recycling of the water and starting material used in the process served to increase, rather than decrease, the purity of the calcium carbonate product. This allows for water conservation as water is not consumed in the process but merely utilised. When <b>waste</b> <b>lime</b> dust was used as the starting material, sulfate was found in the product. While still a white lime, the calcium carbonate was not chemically pure. Sulfate removal was therefore investigated and the use of sulfate-reducing bacteria was studied as a novel application. A mixed sulfate-reducing bacterial population was isolated and found to be hIghly active at sulfate concentrations between 0. 2 and 2 ~~~. They were capable of autotrophic growth and could reduce sulfate in solutions with elevated pH and in calcium carbonate suspensions, although they did not grow readily in these media. A process was designed for the production of bulk quantities of calcium carbonate making use of the facilities and materials available at Lime Acres. This was tested using a small scale bench-top reactor series, with favourable results. The process would allow automatic, continuous production of large quantities of white lime using <b>waste</b> <b>lime</b> dust.

40|$|See {{description}} of calcium oxide {{production in the}} calcium oxide TAP Review. Hydrated lime is produced from the slow addition of water to crushed or ground quicklime (calcium oxide). This is done in a premixing chamber or vessel that mixes and agitates the lime and water at prescribed levels. The addition of water generates considerable heat of the reaction and produces steam. Although the theoretical amount of moisture needed is 24. 5 %, in practice about 50 - 65 % water is added to counteract loss from steam. After hydration, the slightly moist slaked lime is conveyed to a separator where coarse fractions are removed, and the powder dries. It is then bagged in paper sacks or shipped in bulk by truck or rail. The reaction can be characterized as: CaO + H 20 � � Ca(OH) 2 + heat high calcium quicklime high calcium hydrate Depending on the source parent rock, different grades of hydrated lime may be produced. A high calcium hydrate is 71 - 74 % calcium oxide, with 0. 5 - 2 % magnesium oxide and 24 - 25 % water. Slaked lime may also be produced as a waste product.

Enormous amounts of coal waste from these mines were dumped on the slopes, which cause sediment and acid mine drainage to be discharged directly into streams. A limestone slurry by-product (lime cake), which is produced during the manufacture of soda ash, was investigated for its potential use in reclaiming the coal <b>waste.</b> The <b>lime</b> cake is fine grained, has low hydraulic conductivities (10 - 8 to 10 - 9 cm sec- 1), high pH, high electrical conductivity due to the presence of CaO, MgO, and CaCl 2 as major components, and trace amounts of heavy metals. A field experiment was conducted; each plot was 20 x 5 m in size on a 56 % slope. Treatments included a control (<b>waste</b> only), <b>lime</b> (CaCO 3), and lime cake. The lime requirement (LR) of the coal waste to pH 7. 0 was determined, and treatments consisted of adding 100 %, 50 %, and 25 % of the LR. The lime cake and lime were applied in either a layer between the coal waste and topsoil or mixed into the topsoil and coal waste. Each plot was hydroseeded with grasses, and planted with trees. In each plot, soils, surface runoff, and subsurface water were collected and analyzed, and plant cover was measured. The lime cake treatments increased the pH of the coal waste from 3. 5 to 6, and neutralized the pH of the runoff and leachate of the coal waste from 4. 3 to 6. 7.
