5|$|For the album's theme, {{the members}} drew {{inspiration}} from the conversations they had during the first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and ballads that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, Destiny Fulfilled is an R album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among music critics who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US Billboard 200, and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.|$|E

Along with the network change, episodes are now edited and broadcast within a <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> instead of a several-month delay, and elimination fights are aired live.|$|E
25|$|The band {{announced}} {{that they were to}} begin recording sessions with Hoppus in April 2009. Due to drummer Tony Thaxton's broken arm, the band were forced to rearrange the sequence in which they recorded. The drums were replaced by electronic beats and drum machines until Thaxton was able to play properly in the last <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording.</b> It was confirmed that recording had been completed on June 28, 2009.|$|E

50|$|A major {{environmental}} disaster occurred in July 1995, when a <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>record</b> high {{heat and humidity}} caused 739 heat-related deaths, mostly among isolated elderly poor and others without air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|After {{numerous}} pre-production sessions {{the band}} finally entered Addictive Sound Studios with producer and good friend Dean Hadji. After a few <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> the band finished their debut EP, Ms. Mary Mallon.|$|R
500|$|The band changed {{many of the}} tracks' names during recording, retitling [...] "French Disco" [...] to [...] "Magnificent" [...] and [...] "Crazy Tonight" [...] to [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight". [...] "Chromium Chords" [...] became [...] "Tripoli", {{and finally}} [...] "Fez– Being Born". The band {{considered}} [...] "Fez– Being Born" [...] and [...] "Get on your Boots" [...] as album openers, but ultimately decided on [...] "No Line on the Horizon". At {{the end of the}} sessions, the band chose to include [...] "White as Snow", a quiet song about a dying soldier in Afghanistan, to balance out the earlier, rockier tunes. With the exception of this track, U2 had tried to keep the theme of war out of the album. In early December 2008, Clayton stated, [...] "this is definitely the last <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording.</b> But then again, last week was definitely the last <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording,</b> and the week before that." [...] The final sessions ended later that month. No Line on the Horizon is dedicated to Rob Partridge, who signed the band's first record deal in 1980 and died of cancer in late 2008.|$|E
500|$|Final overdubs on {{the song}} {{were carried out}} at Abbey Road on 10 October, during the last <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> for The Beatles. Having {{returned}} from his extended holiday, Martin wrote a string arrangement for four violins, two violas and two cellos. These parts were recorded during the same orchestral overdubbing session as for Lennon's track [...] "Glass Onion". Towards the end of [...] "Piggies", Harrison added the spoken words [...] "One more time", before the orchestra played the last two chords. In his overview of the recording, author and critic Tim Riley interprets the [...] "thick scouse" [...] delivery of this introduction to the [...] "final grand cadence" [...] as Harrison [...] "smearing social elitists with their own symbols of 'high' culture". Everett refers to {{the contrast between the}} various classical elements and the combination of pig sounds and [...] "rude" [...] final cadence as representing an [...] "Orwellian comparison of pigs to socially horrid, though outwardly refined, tyrants".|$|E
500|$|Tom Wilson {{became more}} {{enthusiastic}} as the sessions continued. In {{the middle of}} the <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording,</b> Zappa told him, [...] "I would like to rent $500 worth of percussion equipment for a session that starts at midnight on Friday and I want to bring all the freaks from Sunset Boulevard into the studio to do something special." [...] Wilson agreed. The material was worked into [...] "The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet". In a November 1967 radio interview (posthumously included as part of the 2006 MOFO album), Zappa is heard complaining that the version of [...] "Monster Magnet" [...] released on Freak Out! was in fact an unfinished piece; the percussion track was intended to serve as the foundation for an even more complex piece, but MGM refused to approve the studio time needed to record the intended overdubs that would have completed the composition, and so it was released (to Zappa's great dissatisfaction) in this unfinished form.|$|E
5000|$|Harvey Danger began {{production}} of their second album in March 1999 at Albert Grossman's Bearsville Studios, near Woodstock, New York. Slash/London was unusually uninvolved {{in the recording}} process, a harbinger {{of what was to}} come. After three <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> at Bearsville and several more <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> and mixing in Seattle and Los Angeles, the band submitted the record, King James Version, to their label, and waited. What the band refers to as [...] "elaborate corporate reshuffling" [...] began almost immediately after they finished their album: mergers and acquisitions among record labels left them and their record in limbo for over a year, not knowing to whom they were signed, nor when KJV would be released.|$|R
500|$|Powderfinger {{worked with}} {{producer}} Nick DiDia on Odyssey Number Five, {{as they had}} done on Internationalist, finishing the album in August 2000 after six <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording.</b> The band spent this time ensuring higher quality songs than on Internationalist, which had featured out-of-tune guitars on [...] "Passenger".|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, for the <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>Record</b> Store Day in the United Kingdom, 68,936 {{records were}} sold (an 86.5% rise from 36,957 in 2012). This {{can be broken}} down into 1,249 7" [...] albums, 25,100 12" [...] albums, 27,042 7" [...] singles and 15,545 12" [...] singles.|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} between December 1996–January 1997 at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California. The song was written just outside Hoppus' vocal range, requiring him to strain {{to sing it}} (the song has a noticeably rougher and scratchier vocal track {{than the rest of}} the album). Hoppus was having vocal problems during the recording of the album regardless, due to lack of vocal warm-ups and constant smoking. These factors, combined with the stress of recording [...] "Dammit", led Hoppus to strain his vocal cords significantly, forcing the band to cancel the final <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> the album in December 1996. [...] "I actually like my voice a lot on 'Dammit'. It sounds really raw and cool," [...] said Hoppus in 2001. [...] "But it's not a technique I would recommend for getting a good vocal sound. You know, smoking, yelling, all that." [...] As a result of this incident, the chorus has always been sung by Tom DeLonge in live performances. Guitarist/vocalist Matt Skiba would also take the lead on the chorus after replacing DeLonge in 2015.|$|E
500|$|Production of {{the album}} began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from {{frequent}} collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within {{a period of three}} weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, [...] "How is this going to work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?". He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{creative}} boom while writing lyrics for the album, all {{three members of}} Blink-182 faced setbacks while recording Dude Ranch. DeLonge was having vocal problems and spent much time recording and re-recording vocal tracks, and Hoppus realized he too was having difficulty singing after losing his voice during a one-off Christmas concert. Forced to cancel the final <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> in December 1996, Hoppus realized {{the magnitude of the}} situation and quit smoking in order {{to take care of his}} voice, which was stressed due to lack of vocal warm-ups, full days of vocal tracks, and the strain of singing for [...] "Dammit", which was accidentally written just outside Hoppus' vocal range. Meanwhile, Raynor had broken both heels and was in a wheelchair. Raynor was well enough to record the drum tracks for the album while on crutches. Aside from the recording, the band spent time playing Crash Bandicoot and [...] "reading the articles from the shelves and shelves of Playboys that the studio had thoughtfully provided." [...] The group ate lunch nearly each day at Sombrero, a local Mexican restaurant namedropped in [...] "Josie", and Chinese for dinner from Encinitas' Pick Up Stix.|$|E

50|$|Riding {{the wave}} of notice and {{critical}} approval that arose from their first album, Syrinx returned to the studio in late 1970 to record a second album. However, after <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording,</b> a fire destroyed the studio, the group’s instruments - including Mills-Cockell’s Moog Mark II - and the master tapes of the recordings for their new album.|$|R
50|$|After <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> Overground {{released}} {{their debut}} single, German-sung Schick mir 'nen Engel on November 10, 2003. Produced by Triple M, the song entered the charts at {{number one on}} the German, Austrian and Swiss singles charts and {{became one of the most}} successful (German-speaking) songs of 2003. Their debut album It's Done saw similar success, eventually receiving two platinum certifications.|$|R
500|$|The first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> {{produced}} [...] "Go", [...] "Blood", [...] "Rats", and [...] "Leash" [...] {{before the}} band hit a lull. In {{order to keep}} up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 2010, Brett posted {{an update}} on his Twitter saying, [...] "threw me a going away [...] party and all my friends hung with me tonight – thx everybody, I love you guys." [...] This adds fuel to the {{possibility}} of the band's new album being recorded the first week of May. On May 12, 2010 (which happened to be Brett's 48th birthday), bassist Jay Bentley posted {{an update on}} their Facebook page regarding the recording process of the album: [...] "first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> at joe's house of compression and brooks gets the medal for superasskicking. brian has finished 14 basics... a couple more to go. i started getting some good bass sounds late, late last night, the liver wins the shootout again. brett is playing late night tracks on his birthday, some way to celebrate! happy birthday bg! quote of the day; BG [...] "what percentage of the sound is coming from the snakeskin?". haha... working of album titles and ideas today. it's all coming together. joe says the corn flavored kit kats are gross, but the wasabi ones are quite delicious.... get back to work. work work work. will send photo's soon".|$|E
2500|$|In early April {{and still}} signed to RAK, Jeff Beck {{reformed}} The Jeff Beck Group with [...] keyboardist Max Middleton, drummer Cozy Powell and bassist Clive Chaman and vocalist Alex Ligertwood. Later in April that year the new band began recording sessions at Island Studios, London. They worked on songs by Beck {{and focused on}} Situation, which had lyrics by Ligertwood. Other songs such as Morning Dew were given attention, {{with the help of}} producer Jimmy Miller, who had worked with Traffic and with The Rolling Stones. During May 1971, after a <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> sessions, Beck left RAK and [...] signed a new record deal with CBS. Epic, a subsidiary of CBS, was assigned to release Beck's work, and having heard the Island studio tapes were not happy with the vocals. During May, Beck started looking for a new vocalist. In late May, after hearing Bobby Tench perform with his band Gass, he employed him as vocalist for the band. Tench was given only a few weeks to write new lyrics and add his vocals to the album, before mixing resumed on tracks previously recorded by Beck and the other band members. During early July 1971 the band returned to [...] Island Studios to finish the album and Beck took over as producer. Rough and Ready was released in UK on 25 October 1971 with the US release following during February 1972, a sixteen-day promotional tour in USA followed and the album eventually reached #46 in the album charts.|$|E
50|$|Turisas {{was formed}} in 1997, but didn't have a {{recording}} contract until November 2003, having been signed by Century Media. Thus, Battle Metal {{is a collection of}} songs written over a period of six years. The band began pre-production and recorded a demo in early 2003, after Mathias Nygård, the band's singer and songwriter had completed his one-year military service. Turisas had originally planned to enter a studio later that year, but decided to postpone upon learning that only three and a half <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> time would be available to them. By autumn, Nygård was offered up to five <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> time at the Sound Suite Studio in Marseille, France with Terje Refsnes, a notable producer. Actual recording began in November at the Steeltrack Studio in Parola, Finland, with the violin parts by Olli Vänskä, followed by accordion by Riku Ylitalo. After Tude Lehtonen had completed the drum parts, the band left for France to continue recording through December.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the success}} of Invisible, the band hardly found time to record what would be their next album. However, in 1997 they began {{recording}} and announced the album's release date for the middle of that summer, but it was later delayed until 1998. During this time, Rodrigo Aboitiz (the band's keyboardist) caused a series of troubles, missing the first <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording.</b> After the album was finished, he left the band.|$|R
5000|$|Recording {{the album}} {{took place in}} late 2005 - through to early 2006 over a six-week period. The six <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> were split into four blocks, taking place in Cardiff at Stir studio, Liverpool at The Elevator studio, South Thoresby at The Chapel studio and Hammersmith at The Peace Rooms. Over the four {{locations}} the band worked with 3 different producers, including Richard Jackson in Cardiff, Ian Broudie in Liverpool and Stephen Harris ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Live Through This began on October 8, 1993 at Triclops Sound Studios in Marietta, Georgia. The studio was booked at {{the recommendation of}} The Smashing Pumpkins, who had recorded their second studio album, Siamese Dream (1993) there. The assigned producers were Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade. The first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> was spent recording basic tracks, including drums, bass, scratch guitars, and scratch vocals. After basic tracks were completed, Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, joined the band in-studio before Nirvana were set to tour to promote In Utero. Cobain was presented with the basic tracks and the band invited Cobain to sing on a few unfinished numbers. Cobain initially refused, due to being unfamiliar with the material. When Cobain asked, [...] "how can I sing on it if I haven't heard it?," [...] Love answered by encouraging him to [...] "just sing {{off the top of}} [...] head." [...] Cobain is known to have provided backing vocals to [...] "Asking for It" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest," [...] however Kolderie has said Cobain [...] "sang on about five or so , probably [...] "Violet", [...] "Miss World" [...] and [...] "Doll Parts, I can't remember any of the others." [...] After taking a break for dinner, the session devolved into a [...] "formless jam" [...] with Cobain on drums, Love and Erlandson on guitars and producer Sean Slade on bass. Dana Kletter (blackgirls, Dish, Dear Enemy) was asked to sing backing vocals on the record, and appears on seven songs, including Violet, Miss World, Asking For It, Doll Parts, Softer Softest, and She Walks On Me. Producer Sean Slade said, [...] "I {{think one of the reasons}} that Doll Parts might have been a hit is that harmony Dana does on the You will ache like I ache part, it's almost like an Appalachian close harmony against what Courtney is doing. It's very melancholic." [...] There have been rumors that Kletter did more than sing backing vocals, but the band denies it.|$|E
