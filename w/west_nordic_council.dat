40|$|This {{research}} {{is seeking to}} understand the Faroese cooperation in the <b>West</b> <b>Nordic</b> <b>Council</b> {{as a mean to}} pursue and protect Faroese interests. The Faroes, a non-sovereign actor, have undertaken more responsibility from Denmark and taken a more active role within international relations as a consequence of Danish and Faroese interests being distinct within many fields. Lately the cooperation in the WNC has increased and the focus has been on the Arctic. The Council has put forward visions for the forthcoming future which are in coherence with Faroese interests. The Council seeks to influence international affairs which are affecting the West Nordic region and creating both challenges and opportunities for the three countries, that have strong relational ties connected through similarities in remoteness, fisheries and culture.

As a case study it goes in to depth with the cooperation in the <b>West</b> <b>Nordic</b> <b>Council</b> and seeks to understand its uniqueness and complexity. The study concludes that the <b>West</b> <b>Nordic</b> <b>Council</b> can be understood as a mean to pursue and protect Faroese interest if the members increase their cooperation as envisioned through the understanding of the special constellation of the Council, its potential, its setting and statehood of the Faroes...|$|E
