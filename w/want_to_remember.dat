500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E
500|$|... 2006: In an {{interview}} with ESPN in January, after the Packers had finished with a 4-12 record, Favre admitted {{that if he had}} to make a decision right away he would not come back. He went on to say [...] "There's other days, I go, 'What if it's crunch time, two minutes left, do you want the ball?' I don't know if I do." [...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it. It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to put me on the spot." [...] Asked if he was indeed going to retire, Favre responded [...] "We'll see. We'll see. I don't want to say anything right now." [...] After the game, a Packers teammate said that Favre was just as emotional in a speech after the Seattle Seahawks game in 2005 at Lambeau Field when he was all but certain he was going to retire.|$|E

2500|$|On January 29, 2010, as Original Productions' crews shot footage for season 6 of the Cornelia Marie {{offloading}} C. opilio crab at St. Paul Island, Captain Phil Harris, who {{had earlier}} complained of being excessively tired, {{went to his}} stateroom to retrieve pain medicines and collapsed. Second-year Engineer Steve Ward discovered {{him on the floor}} of his stateroom, conscious but unable to move his left leg or his left hand. Ward immediately got Phil's sons Josh and Jake to come to his stateroom while he called for paramedics. According to Thom Beers, producer and creator of Deadliest Catch, Harris insisted that the camera crews continue to film him. [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> Phil as who he was," [...] Beers told Zap2it.com writer Kate O'Hare. [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> all the dynamics, {{but at the same time}} the guy was insistent when we were doing this, saying, 'Dude, you've got to. We've got to have an end to the story [...] You want to film this, film this.'" [...] Beers said he honored Harris' wishes and continued to shoot as Harris was airlifted to Anchorage, Alaska, where doctors performed emergency brain surgery to relieve the pressure building up in the cranial vault and avoid further brain damage. Harris spent eleven days in ICU before succumbing to complications from his stroke on February 9, 2010.|$|E

White contributed the idea of the drums and bass playing on odd beats.|$|E

The brothers, heading north to Canada, come to the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill on the way.

Tender denies this, but {{it is unclear whether}} he simply doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> or whether he actually can't remember because the trauma is buried so deep in his memory. Adam believes the only way to cure Tender is for Tender to have sex - to reject the Church doctrine at its core.

2500|$|Under the Communist East German government, {{the mass}} suicide became a taboo. The {{site of the}} mass graves was {{deliberately}} not cared for, became overgrown, and was at times tilled with sugar beets. The only visible hint of the mass grave was a solitary monument with the engraved date [...] "1945",, soon also overgrown. In contrast, a [...] obelisk was erected in Demmin's burned down center to commemorate Soviet soldiers {{who had died in}} the area. The local museum listed [...] "2,300 deaths due to warfare and famine" [...] for the years of 1945 and 1946. As late as 1989, the chronicle of the district's Communist party blamed the destruction of the town on Werwolf and Hitler Youth activities. The atrocities were blamed on Germans disguised as Soviets by a document found in the local Soviet military administration in Neubrandenburg. As Der Spiegel puts it:Arbitrary executions, the rapes, the torching of towns – the atrocities of the Red Army were a taboo in the GDR, the mass suicides as well. Those who had witnessed it all or even survived a failed suicide – children, elderly, raped women – were ashamed and kept quiet. Somehow, life had to go on in the system of the liberators. Today, many do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> for too long they had struggled to find a balance between what they had suffered and what they had learned.|$|E
