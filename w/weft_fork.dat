5000|$|John Ramsbottom (11 September 1814 [...] - [...] 20 May 1897) was an English {{mechanical}} engineer. Born in Todmorden, then on {{the county}} border of Yorkshire and Lancashire. Ramsbottom {{was the son of}} a steam cotton mill owner. He learned about steam engines, rebuilding his father's and also invented the <b>weft</b> <b>fork</b> (this has also been attributed to James Bullough) that enabled looms to be run at high speed. He also created many inventions for railways.|$|E
5000|$|James Bullough {{improved}} his loom by inventing various components, including the [...] "self-acting temple", which kept the woven cloth at its correct width, the <b>weft</b> <b>fork</b> (patented 1841 but disputed by Osbaldeston) and a loose reed {{that allowed the}} lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. Bullough also invented a simple but effective warning device which rang a bell every time the warp thread broke on his loom. He worked with William Kenworthy at Brookhouse Mills, with whom he applied his inventions to develop an improved power loom that {{became known as the}} Lancashire Loom.|$|E
