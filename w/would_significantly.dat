Accompanying legislation known as the Local Government Changes for England Regulations 1994 also established a new single-tier form of administrative unit known as a 'Unitary authority'. These new councils {{would be responsible for}} all services carried out by non-metropolitan district and county authorities within their area, thus resembling county boroughs. The county of Hereford & Worcester was to be reviewed again, despite an earlier structural review which recommended no change to the county.|$|E

The design board selected the fifth design, though during refinement of the design, the secondary guns were increased in caliber from 19cm to 24cm. The 30.5cm gun was chosen because the breech of the new 28cm was unreliable. The resulting design was the last pre-dreadnought type of battleship built by the Austro-Hungarian navy.|$|E
5|$|Stylidium {{species with}} glandular trichomes on their sepals, leaves, flower parts, or scapes have been {{suggested}} to be protocarnivorous (or paracarnivorous). The tip of the trichome produces a sticky mucilage—a mixture of sugar polymers and water—that is capable of attracting and suffocating small insects. The ability to trap insects may be a defensive mechanism against damage to flower parts. However, trichomes of S.fimbriatum {{have been shown to}} produce digestive enzymes, specifically proteases, like other carnivorous plants. Adding species of Stylidium to the list of plants that engage in carnivory <b>would</b> <b>significantly</b> increase the total number of known carnivorous plants.|$|E

5|$|The Wrights {{used this}} {{equation}} {{to calculate the}} amount of lift that a wing would produce. Over the years {{a wide variety of}} values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient; Chanute identified up to 50 of them. Wilbur knew that Langley, for example, had used a lower number than the traditional one. Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value, Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider. His results correctly showed that the coefficient was very close to 0.0033 (similar to the number Langley used), not the traditional 0.0054, which <b>would</b> <b>significantly</b> exaggerate predicted lift.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, <b>would</b> <b>significantly</b> reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E
40|$|Fromm (1955) was {{particularly}} critical of western {{society and its}} basis on what he termed the ‘marketing character’, in which he asserts the self is experienced as a commodity whose value and meaning is externally determined and whose intrinsic psychological needs were not adequately addressed. The aim {{of the present study}} is to assess the marketing character (as measured by the SCOI) and Materialism in terms of Spielberger et al’s (1995) notion of ‘psychological vital signs’: depression, anxiety and anger. The hypotheses that the SCOI <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> and positively correlated with Depression and Anxiety were not supported, nor the hypothesis that Materialism total scores <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> and positively correlated with Anxiety was not supported. However, the hypothesis that the SCOI <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> and positively correlated with Anger Expression was supported, as were the hypotheses that Materialism total scores <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> and positively correlated with Depression and Anger Expression, providing support for Fromm’s (1955) assertion that destructive behaviour might serve as a compensatory mechanism for unfulfilled or frustrated intrinsic human needs. The implications of these results are discussed within the framework of a proposed ‘Competition-Frustration-Anger-Aggression Syndrome’ (CFAAS) ...|$|R

A cross-sectional between-participants correlational design, this study investigated four hypotheses on the production line staff of a large manufacturing company: transformational leadership style <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> related to psychological contract fulfilment; psychological contract fulfilment <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> related to levels of engagement, commitment and motivation; leadership style <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> related to engagement, commitment and motivation; and levels of motivation <b>would</b> be <b>significantly</b> different across two divisions. Regression analyses were employed to determine relationships and MANOVA tested for differences between divisions. The paper utilised Bass’s multifactor theory of leadership, various theories of psychological contract breach and fulfilment, Schaufeli and Bakker’s conceptualisation of engagement, Meyer’s three-component model of commitment and various theories of motivation. Analysis found that transformational and transactional leadership {{were significantly related to}} levels of engagement and the autonomous dimension of motivation; transformational leadership was significantly related to levels of normative commitment; and the divisions differed in levels of controlled motivation. The remaining hypotheses were unsupported. Theoretical and practical implications and limitations of this study are outlined and recommendations suggested. University of Leiceste...|$|R

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence <b>would</b> <b>significantly</b> undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} with Persia, the process by which the Delian League became the Athenian Empire reached its conclusion. The allies of Athens were not released from their obligations to provide either money or ships, despite the cessation of hostilities. In Greece, the First Peloponnesian War between the power-blocs of Athens and Sparta, which had continued on/off since 460 BC, finally ended in 445 BC, with the agreement of a thirty-year truce. However, the growing enmity between Sparta and Athens would lead, just 14 years later, into the outbreak of the Second Peloponnesian War. This disastrous conflict, which dragged on for 27 years, would eventually result in the utter destruction of Athenian power, the dismemberment of the Athenian empire, and the establishment of a Spartan hegemony over Greece. However, not just Athens suffered—{{the conflict}} <b>would</b> <b>significantly</b> weaken the whole of Greece.|$|E

5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin <b>would</b> <b>significantly</b> broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E
