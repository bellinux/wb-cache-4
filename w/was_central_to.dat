5|$|At {{the height}} of its medieval glory, Dhaka was {{regarded}} as one of the wealthiest and most prosperous cities in the world. It served as the capital of the Bengal province of the Mughal Empire twice (1608–39 and 1660–1704). The city's name was Jahangir Nagar (City of Jahangir) in the 17th century. It <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the economy of Mughal Bengal, which generated 50% of Mughal GDP. It was a cosmopolitan commercial center and the hub of the worldwide muslin and silk trade.|$|E
5|$|Daphne's {{marriage}} to Des Clarke (Paul Keane) <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> {{many of her}} storylines. After a brief relationship with Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) and two engagements, Daphne married Des in July 1986. She gave birth to their son, Jamie (S.J. Dey), in July 1987. That same year, Smith announced her departure from Neighbours. Not wanting to kill off a popular character, the producers sent Daphne {{to care for her}} dying father. However, viewers were not satisfied with this ending and Smith returned to conclude Daphne's storyline. The actress asked for Daphne to be killed-off and the producers agreed. She made her final appearance on 25 March 1988, becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E

5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been rumoured a deal was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita {{restaurant}} in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the fortunes of New Labour, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally of Liberal Republicans. When the Democrats met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in the state had been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the election.|$|E

5|$|Lyrical poets {{often took}} their {{subjects}} from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents. Additionally, myth <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> classical Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took {{most of their}} plots from myths {{of the age of}} heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in The Birds and The Frogs.|$|E
5|$|Pricing <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the {{marketing}} strategy, {{as it had}} been through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 {{in the case of the}} Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E
5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> debates over the book in the English-speaking world.|$|E

5|$|The cult of Athena Polias (the city's eponymous goddess) <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> Athenian society, {{reinforcing}} {{morality and}} maintaining societal structure. Women {{played a key}} role in the cult; the priestesshood of Athena was a position of great importance, and the priestess could use her influence to support political positions. According to Herodotus, before the Battle of Salamis the priestess of Athena encouraged the evacuation of Athens by telling the Athenians that the snake sacred to Athena (which lived on the Acropolis) had already left.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the Maya stela <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the ideology of Maya kingship {{from the very beginning}} of the Classic Period through to the very end of the Terminal Classic (800–900). The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of Piedras Negras played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, epigrapher Tatiana Proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates, rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised.|$|E
5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> evolutionary thinking.|$|E

First, Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864. Later, John Muir led a successful movement to establish a larger national park encompassing not just the valley, but surrounding mountains and forests as well—paving the way for the U.S. National Park system.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the daily routine of their court. It was {{no coincidence that the}} chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} to the hot-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's intimate friend – ensured Marlborough's rise, first to the Captain-Generalcy of British forces, then to a dukedom. Becoming de facto leader of Allied forces during the War of the Spanish Succession, his victories on the fields of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), ensured {{his place in history}} as one of Europe's great generals. But his wife's stormy relationship with the Queen, and her subsequent dismissal from court, <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> his own fall. Incurring Anne's disfavour, and caught between Tory and Whig factions, Marlborough, who had brought glory and success to Anne's reign, was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile. He returned to England and to influence under the House of Hanover with the accession of GeorgeI to the British throne in 1714.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the {{north-western}} regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that {{were known as}} the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling {{the life of the}} Buddha <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the beginnings of recorded history in India. In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, the court <b>was</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the {{patronage}} {{and dissemination of}} Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that {{she had grown up}} with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. Under James VI the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated the image of a philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine. After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue.|$|E
