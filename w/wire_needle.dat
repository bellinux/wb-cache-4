30|$|After 14  days, {{the mice}} {{were divided into}} two groups: six mice in the {{experimental}} group and two mice in the control group. The experimental group was divided into three experimental groups with different test conditions: (A) Electrical stimulation parameters of mice model (signal: sine wave, signal amplitude Vpp: 5  V, frequency: 300  kHz); (B) (signal: sine wave, signal amplitude Vpp: 5  V, frequency: 100  kHz) and (C) (signal: sine wave, signal amplitude Vpp: 4  V, frequency: 300  kHz) respectively. Each group has 2 mice. The mice in the control group were sprayed with liquid metal electrodes {{on the surface of the}} tumor, leaving only 4  cm 2 normal skin on the other side of the tumor without TTFields.

40|$|The use of {{electromyography}} (EMG) as {{a diagnostic}} aid for equine hyperkalemic periodic paresis (EHPP) {{was investigated in}} seven affected and seven control horses. Affected horses were confirmed positive for EHPP either by elevated serum potassium concentration with clinical signs of myotonia, or by inducing hyperkalemia and clinical signs using oral potassium chloride challenge. All horses were asymptomatic at the time EMG was performed, using bipolar fine <b>wire</b> <b>needle</b> electrodes. The myopotentials were recorded on magnetic tape and displayed on paper charts for analysis. Insertional and resting activity were recorded from the right supraspinatus, triceps, extensor carpi radialis and gluteal muscles in standing horses. Myotonic discharges were seen in six of seven affected horses but not {{in any of the}} controls. All seven affected horses and two control horses had prolonged insertional activity. Five out of seven affected horses and one control horse displayed spontaneous motor unit discharges unrelated to recording electrode movement. Myoelectrical potentials containing closely timed muscle potentials, i. e. doublets, were found in all affected horses, with four of seven affected horses also showing triplets. These potentials were not observed in any of the controls. No obvious difference in activity was observed among the four muscle sites tested. It is concluded that EMG is a safe and useful tool for diagnosing EHPP in horses not currently displaying clinical signs. Myotonic discharges and doublets appear to be the most diagnostically significant electromyographic abnormalities in EHPP affected horses...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Percutaneous balloon valvotomy was studied {{retrospectively}} in newborns with critical pulmonary valve stenosis or atresia {{to assess}} its potential {{role as an}} alternative therapy to operation. Background. Severe right ventricular outflow tract obstructions are life-threatening conditions requiring prostaglandin infusion immediately after birth and then relief of the valvular obstruction. To avoid surgical hazards at this age, {{it would be useful}} to extend to newborns the balloon valvotomy so effective in older patients. Methods. Ninety-seven newborns (82 with critical pulmonary valve stenosis, 15 with atresia) underwent balloon valvotomy, provided that they had a well developed right ventricle, including an infundibulum close to the pulmonary artery. In patients with atresia, the outflow tract membrane had to be perforated with a <b>wire</b> <b>needle</b> or a radiofrequency probe. Results. Balloon valvotomy could be performed in 81 patients and was effective in 77. It caused 3 fatal and 16 nonfatal complications. Ten patients with persistent poor right ventricular compliance despite an effective valvotomy required a surgical shunt. Among the 81 patients in whom the procedure could be performed, right ventricular surgery was avoided in 5 (55 %) of the 9 patients with atresia (95 % confidence interval [CI] 28 % to 80 %) and 55 (76 %) of the 72 patients with stenosis (95 % CI 66 % to 86 %) at the end of the follow-up period (9. 7 years). Conclusions. Balloon pulmonary valvotomy is not always feasible in newborns, but it is relatively safe and effective and should be considered a valid alternative to operation...|$|E

METHODS Five female patients aged 26 to 60 scheduled for elective intra-abdominal gynecological operations were studied. None had clinical evidence of neurologic or psychiatric disorders, and none was receiving narcotics, hypnotics, or other drugs with central nervous system effects prior to the study. Secobarbital (100 mg.) was administered orally to each patient in the evening prior to surgery.

40|$|We {{would like}} to express our opinion on the article by Ciriaco and {{associates}} [1]; first of all we congratulate them for the results obtained in their study. We know that for small and deep pulmonary nodules the localization techniques are necessary, and in 1999 Susuki et al. [2] established dimensions and depth of the nodules {{for which it is}} necessary for a localization’s technique. We think that preoperative localization techniques have some negative aspects. First of all, the use of <b>needle</b> <b>wire</b> can provoke pneumothorax, haemorrhages into the lung, parenchimal damage or peri-nodule inflammation in a high number of patients [1, 3]. We are sure that in the major number of cases these complications are non-symptomatic, but they can influence negatively the state of health of a patient and surgical approach, for example the peri-nodule inflammation can influence resection’s margins. Second, based on the international literature, the <b>needle</b> <b>wire</b> and the other preoperative techniques (vital dye and radio-guided) do not have a high percentage of localization, and there is no statistical difference in time between thoracoscopy more hook wire placement and thoracotomy [1]. Therefore, we never perform a pre-operative localization technique, like <b>needle</b> <b>wire,</b> and we prefer intra-thoracoscopic ultrasound [4]. For us, ultrasound is the most effective method to localize pulmonary nodules without side effects. Intrathoracoscopic ultrasound is useful and has a great percentage of 100...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to surface electrodes, clinicians may also insert <b>wires</b> or <b>needles</b> intramuscularly to record an EMG signal. While {{this is more}} painful and often costly, the signal is more reliable since surface electrodes pick up cross talk from nearby muscles. The use of surface electrodes is also limited to superficial muscles, making the intramuscular approach beneficial to access signals from deeper muscles. The electrical activity {{picked up by the}} electrodes is recorded and displayed in the same fashion as the surface electrodes. Prior to placing surface electrodes, the skin is normally shaved, cleaned and exfoliated to get the best signal. Raw EMG signals resemble noise (electrical signal not coming from the muscle of interest) and the voltage fluctuates, therefore they are processed normally in three ways: rectification, filtering, and integration. This processing allows for a unified signal that is then able to be compared to other signals using the same processing techniques.|$|R
40|$|ISBN 88 - 7711 - 637 - 7 International audienceThroughout the {{practice}} of procedural medicine, there is an unrelenting shift to management by less invasive techniques such as interventional radiology (IR). This subspecialty within radiology uses imaging to guide <b>needles,</b> <b>wires</b> and catheters using tiny access incisions. Like other minimally invasive techniques, risk, pain and recovery times are reduced as compared with more invasive approaches such as open surgery. These benefits, alongside the emergence of increasingly novel therapeutic technologies, are driving worldwide expansion. The core skills of IR include the Seldinger technique {{and the use of}} imaging and touch to effectively guide <b>needles,</b> <b>wires</b> and catheters {{in a wide range of}} procedures. Safe practice requires the operator to respond correctly to both visual and tactile cues in vascular angioplasty, stenting and stent-grafting, as well as control of bleeding, biopsy, abscess drainage and catheterization of the urinary and biliary tracts for drainage and stenting. The operator's deliberations may then initiate and inform a range of motor actions, including very fine translational and rotational motions, particularly in challenging anatomy. As the spectrum of available techniques increases, so the limited number and availability of suitably trained practitioners becomes a factor in their restricted availability to patients. Awareness of the need to expand IR training facilities is thus highly topical...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The dynamic {{response}} of deformable bodies varies significantly in dependence on mechanical {{properties of the}} objects: while the dynamics of a stiff and light object (e. g. <b>wire</b> or <b>needle)</b> involves high-frequency phenomena such as vibrations, much lower frequencies are sufficient for capturing dynamic {{response of}} an object composed of a soft tissue. Yet, when simulating mechanical interactions between soft and stiff deformable models, a single time-step is usually employed to compute the time integration of dynamics of both objects. However, {{this can be a}} serious issue when haptic rendering of complex scenes composed of various bodies is considered. In this paper, we present a novel method allowing for dynamic simulation of a scene composed of colliding objects modelled at different frequencies: typically, the dynamics of soft objects are calculated at frequency about 50 Hz, while the dynamics of stiff object is modeled at 1 kHz, being directly connected to the computation of haptic force feedback. The collision response is performed at both low and high frequencies employing data structures which describe the actual constraints and are shared between the high and low frequency loops. During the simulation, the realistic behaviour of the objects according to the mechanical principles (such as non-interpenetration and action-reaction principle) is guaranteed. Examples showing the scenes involving different bodies in interaction are given, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed method. I...|$|R

A significant shift of the resonant absorption band of liquid mesoparticles has been observed under dielectric confinement, which is in good agreement with model predictions.

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of {{telegraphy}} {{it was found that the}} effects of telluric currents and lightning strikes could have an adverse effect on the permanent magnets used in the needles used to display signals.

The [...] "false reversal" [...] of telegraph signals used in railway signalling presented a great danger.

In {{consequence}} of the comparisons that will hereafter arise between wires carrying voltaic and ordinary electricities, and also because of certain views of the condition of a wire or any other conducting substance connecting the poles of a voltaic apparatus, {{it will be necessary}} to give some definite expression of what is called the voltaic current, in contradistinction to any supposed peculiar state of arrangement, not progressive, which the wire or the electricity within it may be supposed to assume. If two voltaic troughs PN, P'N', fig. 42, be symmetrically arranged and insulated, and the ends NP' connected by a wire, over which a magnetic needle is suspended, the wire will exert no effect over the needle; but immediately that the ends PN' are connected by another <b>wire,</b> the <b>needle</b> will be deflected, and will remain so as long as the circuit is complete. Now if the troughs merely act by causing a peculiar arrangement in the wire either of its particles or its electricity, that arrangement constituting its electrical and magnetic state, then the wire NP' should be in a similar state of arrangement before P and N' were connected, to what it is afterwards, and should have deflected the needle, although less powerfully, perhaps to one half the extent which would result when the communication is complete throughout. But if the magnetic effects depend upon a current, then it is evident why they could not be produced in any degree before the circuit was complete; because prior to that no current could exist.|$|R
25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook <b>wires,</b> thread <b>needles,</b> or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|R

SETTING [...] Combined gastroenterology service, Scarborough Hospital. PATIENTS [...] 108 Consecutive patients identified as having a discrete mass on diagnostic ultrasound examination of the abdomen. INTERVENTION [...] A sample of tissue was obtained with an aseptic technique under local anaesthesia: an 18 steel <b>wire</b> gauge <b>needle</b> (Tru-Cut) was mounted in a spring loaded firing device (Biopty gun) that was advanced under simultaneous ultrasound scanning, permitting precise localisation of the target organ. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Results of histological examination of tissue specimens. RESULTS [...] Biopsy failed in four patients. Adequate histological specimens were obtained in 104 patients with masses in the liver (31), pancreas (37), kidney (10), and adrenal glands (six) and in 20 undiagnosed abdominal and retroperitoneal masses. Follow up was until death or confirmation of the diagnosis. Three complications but no deaths occurred. Malignancy was suspected in 84 patients before biopsy. This was confirmed in 70 patients, in 26 of whom confirmation of dissemination obviated {{the need for further}} investigation. In 10 patients biopsy indicated a previously unsuspected primary tumour, and in 12 it showed only a benign lesion. Among 24 patients considered to have benign disease biopsy showed an unsuspected neoplasm in seven. Use of biopsy thus had a major effect on clinical management in 55 patients. Four false negative but no false positive diagnoses resulted from the procedure. CONCLUSION [...] Percutaneous biopsy of abdominal and retroperitoneal masses under ultrasound guidance is a safe and accurate method of obtaining a histological diagnosis.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{critical}} {{lower limb}} ischemia without patent pedal arteries cannot {{be treated by}} the conventional arterial reconstruction. Venous arterialization has been suggested to improve limb salvage in this subgroup of patients but has not gained wide acceptance. We report our early experience after implementing deep and superficial venous arterialization of the lower limb. Materials and methods: Ten patients with critical ischemia and without crural or pedal arteries available for conventional bypass surgery or angioplasty were treated with distal venous arterialization. Inflow was from the most distal unobstructed segment. Run-off was the dorsal pedal venous arch (n= 5), the dorsal pedal venous arch and a concomitant vein of the posterior tibial artery (n= 3), or the dorsal pedal venous arch and a concomitant vein of the common plantar artery (n= 2) depending on {{the location of the}} ischemic lesion. Venous valves were destroyed using antegrade valvulotomes, guide <b>wires,</b> knob <b>needles,</b> or retrograde valvulotomes via an extra incision. Results: Seven of the operated limbs were amputated after 23 (1 – 256) days (median [range]). The main reasons for amputation were lack of healing of either the original wound, of incisional wounds on the foot, or persisting pain at rest. In three cases, the bypass was open at the time of amputation. Two patients experienced complete wound healing after 231 and 342 days, respectively. By the end of follow-up, the last patient was ambulating with slow wound healing but without pain 309 days after surgery. Conclusion: Venous arterialization may be used as a treatment of otherwise unsalveable limbs. The success rate is, however, limited. Technical optimization of the technique is warranted...|$|R
