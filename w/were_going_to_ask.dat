60|$|Alas! it is {{the last}} hurdle which often floors the rider, and Thomas too was doomed to find the final ordeal an insurmountable one. As he crossed the room some evil chance made him think of the gossip outside and of his allusion to the abstruse {{substance}} known as cacodyl.

They were in London, and had run down to Liverpool on the chance of getting berths. Beyond this she was not definite, and there was an absence of Burnamy not only from her company but from her conversation which mystified March through all his selfish preoccupations with his wife. She was a girl who had her reserves, but for a girl who had so lately and rapturously written them of her engagement, there was a silence concerning her betrothed that had almost positive quality. With his longing to try Miss Triscoe upon Mrs. March's malady as a remedial agent, he had now the desire to try Mrs. March upon Miss Triscoe's mystery as a solvent. She stood talking to him, and refusing to sit down and be wrapped up in the chair next her father. She said that if he <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mrs. March to let her come to her, it would not be worth while to sit down; and he hurried below.|$|E

On 4 January 2013 Devitt re-joined Grimsby on loan for the rest of the 2012-13 season. In his second game back for Town he scored the equaliser in a 2-1 away win at Welling United that sent Grimsby into the quarter finals of the FA Trophy. In the quarter-final he opened the scoring with a free kick in Town's 3-0 victory over Luton Town. Town eventually made it through to the final at Wembley Stadium but were beaten by Wrexham on a penalty shootout after the game ended 1-1, Devitt was an unused substitute. In the league, Grimsby dropped off the pace and despite leading the Conference for majority of the season they eventually finished 4th and were defeated by Newport County in the play-offs. Devitt played 15 league matches for Grimsby, scoring two goals.|$|E
