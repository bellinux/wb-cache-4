5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, {{as opposed to the}} more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's draft <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{morality}} play overlaid {{with current}} Western political overtones, {{and that the}} dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed {{to work on the}} script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, {{during the}} reign of Sultan Abdülaziz, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 other types of warships, ranking as the third largest navy in the world after the British and French navies.

25|$|Meier told Donald that he {{was sure}} the Democrats would win the {{election}} because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes {{that had never been}} released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien. According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> danger for Nixon to ignore.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the Pirates {{moved to}} nearby Bracknell, {{becoming}} the Bracknell Pirates {{and later the}} Thames Valley Tigers. For many years, the Tigers {{were one of the}} front runners of the British basketball scene, winning the league Championship in 1994, but it was in the new millennium that the successes dried up and for owner John Nike, the team <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> financial burden. In April 2005, he announced that he would no longer be funding the basketball franchise nor his ice hockey franchise Bracknell Bees.|$|E
25|$|Composure {{would be}} {{required}} from Aftab Ahmed and Mohammad Ashraful, but the pair lasted only one over, Fernando bowling a slower ball to Ashraful which {{he could not get}} bat on and was lbw for 0. Aftab Ahmed saw off six more balls before he, too, was lbw, misreading the line of a ball from Maharoof, and captain Bashar completed the procession by edging to Sangakkara for 1. In 26 deliveries, Bangladesh had only scored seven runs, and they had lost six wickets in the process. The primary task for Bangladesh now were to survive 48 overs (their innings had been shortened slightly due to bad light), but even that <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> challenge, as the spinners Upul Chandana and Tillakaratne Dilshan shared the four last wickets, all caught, to see Bangladesh all out for 108.|$|E

25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
500|$|During {{the initial}} {{storyboard}} pitch to Frederator Studios, Ward brought a guitar {{and played the}} episode's theme song. Frederator's CEO Fred Seibert was initially disinclined to make the short, feeling it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "student film" [...] and without much commercial appeal. Longtime colleagues, development executive Homan and production executive Kevin Kolde, convinced him otherwise, arguing that Seibert had actually laughed in the presentation, something {{that he did not}} often do. Frederator approved the pitch, and [...] "Adventure Time" [...] soon went into production.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} was very {{different}} from what was eventually published because he removed parts he felt were too sensational or dramatized. In the first draft, the story was told entirely {{from the point of view}} of Elmer, an intelligent chicken who is also an actor. Influenced by David Beauchard’s Epileptic and David Mazzucchelli’s City of Glass, Alanguilan altered the story's structure to focus on Elmer's son, Jake. Alanguilan also drew on an event from his teenage years, when he found his father's diary and read about the death of Gerry's uncle Dennis. The new format turned the story into one about Alanguilan, his parents, and his [...] "fears of losing them as they get older." [...] The original opening scene was a human attacking a chicken before being revealed as a film production. Alanguilan believed the scene <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gimmick and moved it to the middle of the book.|$|E

500|$|Near {{the end of}} the {{production}} run of the show's fifth season, Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kenny was killed off permanently. The reasoning behind the idea was to genuinely surprise fans, and to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters Stotch, a breakout character whose popularity was growing with the viewers and creators of the show. In the episode [...] "Kenny Dies", Kenny dies after developing terminal muscular dystrophy, while Parker and Stone claimed that Kenny would not be returning in subsequent episodes. The duo insisted they grew tired of upholding the tradition of having Kenny die in each episode. Stone stated that thinking of humorous ways to kill the character was initially fun, but became more mundane as the series progressed. When they determined that it would be too difficult to develop the character because he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "prop", Parker and Stone finally decided to kill off Kenny permanently.|$|E
500|$|Moon's {{first serious}} {{relationship}} was with Kim Kerrigan, whom he started dating in January 1965 after {{she saw the}} Who play at Le Disque a Go! Go! in Bournemouth. By {{the end of the}} year, she discovered she was pregnant; her parents, who were furious, met with the Moons to discuss their options and she moved into the Moon family home in Wembley. They were married on 17 March 1966 at Brent Registry Office, and their daughter Amanda was born on 12 July. The marriage (and child) were kept secret from the press until May 1968. Moon was occasionally violent towards Kim: [...] "if we went out after I had Mandy," [...] she later said, [...] "if someone talked to me, he'd lose it. We'd go home and he'd start a fight with me." [...] He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. [...] "He {{had no idea how to}} be a father," [...] Kim said. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{publication}} in 1999, Battle Royale became a bestseller in Japan. The novel was earlier {{entered into the}} 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, but was eventually rejected {{in the final round}} with no winner that year. All three members of the final round's selection committee that year admitted Battle Royale was the best work, but declined to award it due to its controversial content. Hiroshi Aramata said that while it was the best nominee in terms of [...] "story, structure, and subject matter," [...] he felt it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Kinpachi-sensei parody and suspected its content would cause problems. Katsuhiko Takahashi felt that although it was the superior work as far as its construction as a novel, giving the award to a story about students killing each other at [...] "this time" [...] would hurt the reputation of the competition. Mariko Hayashi said that while she believed it was the best of the four novels, it was like reading an [...] "unpleasant near-future manga" [...] and [...] "No matter how squarely it might be horror or how interesting it might be, I'm not so sure we should be writing stories like this." [...] In 2001, Kōji Ōnuma wrote , a dissertation that explores the themes of the book.|$|E

500|$|The 2003–04 NHL season {{would be}} the last for Stevens. [...] Before ending the season, he surpassed former {{teammate}} Larry Murphy as the NHL's all-time leader in games played by a defenceman, when he appeared in his 1,616th game in November. He missed several games in January with the flu, and while he was out, he was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome (which would eventually coerce him into retirement). [...] Despite missing {{the second half of the}} season, he was still voted in as a starter for the Eastern Conference All-Star team. Scott Niedermayer filled in as captain in Stevens' absence, but the loss of Stevens, as well as Daneyko, who had retired before the season, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> loss for the Devils' defence, and they fell to the Flyers in the first round of the playoffs. In the offseason, Stevens recovered and continued to work out, and expected to return to the Devils for the 2004–05 NHL season. However, the lockout canceled the entire season, and Stevens retired on September 6, 2005, after 1635 NHL games, fourth at the time (and now seventh) all-time in games played, the leader in games played by a defenceman (since passed by Chris Chelios), and 14th all-time in career penalty minutes.|$|E
500|$|Although Kiedis' {{drug use}} {{disrupted}} the early recording process, the Chili Peppers still had an enjoyable time recording the album. [...] The band was musically {{inspired by the}} rejoining of their original drummer Jack Irons, which added [...] "such an important and different element to our chemistry." [...] Beinhorn encouraged the band to expand their musical horizons on the album, and although the band were initially uncomfortable stepping out of their comfort zone, the members began to feel that Beinhorn was helping them produce their best work. [...] Slovak helped Kiedis record his vocals on the album. [...] In between takes, Slovak would run around the studio out of excitement and say [...] "This {{is the most beautiful}} thing we've ever done." [...] Slovak reflected on his deep connection to the album in his diary; [...] "It was so fun. [...] I'm so extremely proud of everybody's workit is at times genius." [...] During a jam session, the guitarist created a melodic riff which differed greatly in style from the band's previous work. [...] While Slovak nearly abandoned the riff out of fear that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> departure stylistically, Beinhorn saw potential in the new melody-based style and encouraged Slovak to turn the short tune into a full song. [...] While the band was skeptical at first, each member began writing their own musical parts and the song became one of the album's three singles, [...] "Behind the Sun".|$|E
500|$|Critics had widely {{divergent}} {{views of}} Sue's storyline. Keller wrote, [...] "They made Sue Sylvester into a cartoon character."

While Canning also noted the shift in tone [...] "from despicable Sue to cartoony evil Sue", he enjoyed her [...] "attempt to hijack Secret Santa", and said it was [...] "another fun reason to love to hate Sue Sylvester". Hankinson felt that the Grinch was [...] "the perfect touchstone for the heartless Ms. Sylvester and Jane Lynch's lanky frame made the physical humor (think gliding {{around the base of the}} tree on her belly) really sing." [...] Poniewozik called Sue's transformation [...] "pretty amusing to watch", admitted that he doubted he would [...] "have been able to resist the urge to put the rangy Jane Lynch in that classic role" [...] and called Brittany as Cindy Lou Who [...] "unexpected, clever and surprisingly touching". Several reviewers commented favorably on Becky playing Max, including Canning, who wrote [...] "it was all worth it to realize Becky is and always will be the Max to Sue's Grinch", and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack declared, [...] "I totally love how Becky is becoming Sue’s little minion. It’s both adorable and hilarious." ...|$|E

500|$|Zero was {{designed}} by Kimihiko Fujisaka, a designer who had worked on each entry in the Drakengard series. His original design was meant to emulate her status as a god-like being, and have a more elaborate and heroic appearance, but as the game's atmosphere was finalized, Fujisaka redesigned her with some unaesthetic elements, taking direct influence from the game atmosphere: this was the main reason behind adding her prosthetic arm. The original creation of the arm was a pure accident on Fujisaka's part. Her color palate {{was intended as a}} reverse of Caim, the protagonist of Drakengard. Other aspects of her design evoked the color and design for the Goddess of the Seal, a key character in the earlier Drakengard games. She went through two redesigns before Yoko was satisfied. Her final design, along with the flower in her eye, emphasized her sexuality. She originally had no flower in her design, but Fujisaka wanted to add an aspect of femininity to her appearance. The decision to place it in her eye was to add originality to the character: while the game's producer Takamata Shiba originally feared it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> risk in conjunction with her gender, Yoko approved of the design. After Zero was finalized, Yoko decided on more female characters, and told Fujisaka to [...] "think Puella Magi Madoka Magica" [...] while designing them. Elements of her design were incorporated into the other Intoners. Her design, {{along with the rest of}} the main characters, was inspired by modern clothing styles and fashion in contrast to the [...] "medieval" [...] inspiration of previous games.|$|E
