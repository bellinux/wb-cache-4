5|$|The Imme R100 was a {{lightweight}} motorcycle made by Riedel AG from 1948 to 1951. It is {{noted for its}} simple and innovative design with many advanced features. With low cost and technical innovation, the R100 sold well, but reliability problems and low profit margins resulted in <b>warranty</b> costs driving Riedel AG into bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|However, the Imme {{began to}} develop problems, {{especially}} with the single-sided crankshaft bearings and the freewheel for the kick starter. Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version, which had a conventional crankshaft with two bearings.

40|$|Several {{federal energy}} {{programs}} aim to "commercialize" new energy tech- nologies, i. e., {{to bring them}} from research to the market. Product standards and <b>warranties</b> are sometimes a part of these programs. Yet the benefits which the standards and <b>warranties</b> are to achieve are rarely articulated, and how these benefits will be achieved is often even less clear. This article takes {{the view that the}} substantive goals of standards and <b>warranties</b> can be articulated. It examines the functions of standards and <b>warranties</b> and the processes which produce them, and casts their effects in terms of impacts upon the new technology's demand, supply and industrial market structure. The relevance of these impacts upon commercialization programs is then discussed, covering the role of standards in the new in- dustry's development, the need for standards and <b>warranties</b> in demonstration projects and in the private financing of new energy systems, and mechanisms for development of standards and <b>warranties.</b> The need for basic research on standards and <b>warranties</b> is then addressed.

5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the <b>warranty</b> had expired.|$|E
5|$|When Nintendo {{published}} {{the game in}} North America, the packaging design featured {{a small portion of}} the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies. Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a <b>warranty</b> card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured <b>warranty</b> claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E

5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery replacement process, user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case. The <b>warranty</b> on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E

50|$|Representations and <b>warranties</b> by {{the seller}} {{with regard to}} the company, which are claimed to be true at both the time of signing and the time of closing.

Some agreements provide that if the representations and <b>warranties</b> by the seller prove to be false, the buyer may claim a refund of part of the purchase price, as is common in transactions involving privately held companies (although in most acquisition agreements involving public company targets, the representations and <b>warranties</b> of the seller do not survive the closing).

40|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, representations and <b>warranties</b> (contractual statements enforceable through legal action) may have given investors false assurance that mortgage loans were being properly underwritten. This assurance in turn may have contributed to overinvestment in mortgage-backed securities in two ways. First, the assumption that legally enforceable penalties associated with reps and <b>warranties</b> would deter lax underwriting may have led to less monitoring of these contracts than would otherwise have occurred. In turn, the lack of monitoring of actual underwriting practices enabled the spread of lax lending practices. The existence of these reps and <b>warranties</b> and the potential penalties associated with them did not deter lax underwriting. Paradoxically, after the fact, the reps and <b>warranties</b> were enforced and this enforcement contributed to a tightening of credit beyond historic norms. Post-crisis, lenders’ fears over put-back exposure caused them to scale back, particularly on government lending to creditworthy borrowers. The reps and <b>warranties</b> as used in mortgage lending in {{the run-up to}} the crisis were part of the procyclicality of lending, both in the easing and tightening phases of the lending cycle. We suggest reforms to add to the deterrent value of reps and <b>warranties.</b> Particularly we suggest a shift to the countercyclical techniques including dynamic provisioning to increase the in terrorem effect of representations and <b>warranties.</b> Nonetheless such changes would be useless unless they were adopted throughout the lending industry, otherwise, just those entities with risky practices would increase their market share. And next time such entities are more likely to be thinly capitalized, as the lesson of capital exposure to legal risk has been learned, thus further reducing the deterrence effect of reps and <b>warranties,</b> going forward...|$|R
