5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, {{the remnants of the}} depression brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. High winds accompanied the rainfall and left about 50,000 residences without power. Several trees were downed and some structures sustained damage from fresh <b>water</b> <b>flooding.</b> Landslides occurred along major highways and significant structural damage was reported around Mazatlán. However, there was no loss of life or reports of injuries.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{striking}} Iran, Gonu dropped {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall, including 74mm (2.91in) {{in the city}} of Chabahar. Winds reached 111km/h (69mph), which caused power outages and damaged some homes made of clay; the power outage led to some fires across the city. The rainfall flooded at least 40houses, and resulted in the temporary closure of several major roads. Cyclone Gonu produced a storm tide of 2m (6.5ft) in some locations, with many homes near the coastline receiving damage. In Jask, heavy rainfall overflowed a river, killing three people in a vehicle caught in the <b>water.</b> <b>Flooding</b> from the rainfall also destroyed a dam in Nikshahr County. Throughout the country, the cyclone caused 28deaths, including 20 from drowning; damage in Iran was estimated at 2billion (2007IRR, $216million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the <b>water,</b> <b>flooding</b> swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.|$|E

5|$|Voroshilov {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Marti South {{shipyard}} in Nikolayev on 15 October 1935; {{the second of the}} Project 26, to use their industrial designation, Kirov-class cruisers. She was launched on 28 June 1937, but she had to wait for her Soviet-built machinery to be delivered before she was completed on 20 June 1940. On 26 June 1941 Voroshilov covered Soviet destroyers bombarding Constanta, after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and was slightly damaged by a mine exploded by the destroyer 's paravanes. She bombarded Axis troops near Odessa on 19 September with 148 180mm shells and was transferred to Novorossiysk shortly afterwards. On 2 November the ship was bombed in harbor by Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 51. She was hit twice; one hit started a fire in #3 magazine that was extinguished by <b>water</b> <b>flooding</b> in from the second hit. Voroshilov had to be towed to Poti for repairs, which lasted until February 1942. She shelled Axis positions near Feodosiya on 19 March and 3 April 1942, but was damaged by fragments from bombs from Ju 88s on 10 April and had to return to Batumi for minor repairs.|$|E
25|$|The area of low {{pressure}} affecting southern Great Britain on 13–14 November caused some surface <b>water</b> <b>flooding</b> and damage from gales. Surface <b>water</b> <b>flooding</b> affected Devon and Cornwall. The gale-force winds across the counties brought down trees, branches, power cables and roofs. Local {{authorities and the}} Highways Agency were strained in maintaining traffic flow. Dorset reported coastal flooding as severe gales occurred during high tide. Some residents across the Welsh counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire were rescued by Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service. Flooding was widespread in the Conwy Valley, with homes in Betws-y-Coed, Llanrwst and nearby villages affected. Twelve people were rescued from a coach trapped in floodwater at Haverfordwest.|$|E

In addition, several parking structures were partially inundated, trapping nearly 740 cars.|$|E
25|$|To {{support these}} major pipelines, the {{industry}} gradually developed a complex network of feeder {{lines in the}} three most westerly provinces. A historic addition to this system was the 866-kilometre Norman Wells pipeline, which was in effect {{an extension of the}} Interprovincial line. This pipeline accompanied the expansion and <b>water</b> <b>flooding</b> of the oilfield, and began bringing 600 cubic metres of oil per day to Zama, in northwestern Alberta, in early 1985. From Zama, Norman Wells oil travels through other crude oil arteries to markets in Canada and the United States. Interprovincial Pipeline was the foundation from which the large Canadian corporation Enbridge grew.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{crude oil}} is {{normally}} {{extracted from the}} ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, <b>water</b> <b>flooding</b> and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production {{is used in the}} Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered {{only a small fraction of}} the oil in place, so it not often used today.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Isaac Njilah, a {{geologist}} at the University of Yaoundé, {{suggested that the}} natural dam of volcanic rock that keeps in the lake's waters could collapse in the near future. Erosion has worn the dam away, causing holes and pockets to develop in the dam's upper layer, and water already passes through the lower section. Meanwhile, landslides have reduced dam strength on the outside. Seismic activity caused by the lake's volcanic foundation could thus cause the lake wall to give way, resulting in up to 50million cubic metres (1.8billion cuft) of <b>water</b> <b>flooding</b> downhill into areas of the Northwest Province and the Nigerian states of Taraba and Benue. Njilah estimates that the area is {{home to more than}} 10,000people.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with <b>water.</b> <b>Flooding</b> of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic hydrogen recombiners.|$|E
25|$|On the bridge, Captain Bartlett {{was already}} {{considering}} efforts {{to save the}} ship, despite its increasingly dire condition. Only two minutes after the blast, boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated. In about ten minutes, Britannic was roughly in the same condition Titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg. Fifteen minutes after the ship was struck, the open portholes on E Deck were underwater. With water also entering the ship's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five, Britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to {{the weight of the}} <b>water</b> <b>flooding</b> into the starboard side. With the shores of the Greek island Kea to the right, Bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in attempt to beach the vessel. The effect of the ship's starboard list and the weight of the rudder made attempts to navigate the ship under its own power difficult, and the steering gear was knocked out by the explosion, which eliminated steering by the rudder. However, the captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side, which helped the ship move towards the island.|$|E

It has been developed more than 40  years and has entered the high water cut late development stage without having been flooded by polymer before. In order to evaluate the harm of chemical injection, some wells in South block 5 were selected to shut into measure the wellbore pressure. At first, shut-in pressure measurement was conducted during <b>water</b> <b>flood,</b> then followed polymer slug and lastly followed by ASP slug.
