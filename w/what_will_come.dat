It's time to take our music down different directions and really explore other avenues.|$|E
500|$|Alwyn W. Turner in {{the book}} The Rough Guide to Rock stated that the album {{features}} [...] "the best of her slow pieces" [...] displaying that [...] "Madonna had evolved over the years into an excellent ballad singer." [...] Edna Gundersen from USA Today said that the album [...] "flaunts the less sizzling, though equally galvanizing, highlights of her career." [...] She was mostly impressed with Madonna's vocal and emotional power on the track [...] "You'll See" [...] which became [...] "the clearest proof that the ambitious blonde is more singer than celebrity." [...] J. Randy Taraborrelli in his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography picked the David Foster produced tracks as standouts, saying [...] "It was interesting that, {{with all of his}} [...] exciting musical ability from which to draw, he and Madonna would come up with two of the most sombre songs she has ever recorded—but such is the excitement of collaboration; one never knows <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> of it." [...] Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post said the arrangements on the new songs [...] "show a great leap in sophistication" [...] and felt that Madonna [...] "has invested much in improving her vocal technique." [...] Robert Christgau criticized the album with a [...] "dud" [...] rating, indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Alison Kopki of The Aquarian Weekly {{called the}} album, a [...] "fun listen and decent starting-off point", and it [...] "lets Radke get some things off his chest". The track-by-track {{breakdown}} noted the songs having [...] "fast guitars, heavy drums and shred guitar solos". Kenneth E. Oquist of Arts and Entertainment Playground gave the album a {{four out of}} a possible five score overall. Oquist noted the mix of pop and hardcore, stating, [...] "Hardcore and pop crashed together to become hardcore pop... Much like Nine Inch Nails created the genre industrial rock, Falling in Reverse has created a unique sound..." [...] He gave a track-by-track review of the album, particularly emphasizing [...] "Raised by Wolves", [...] "I'm Not a Vampire", and [...] "Caught Like a Fly". Things pointed out included: Michael Baskette's production, the band's instrumentation, and Radke's melodies. The writer noted the repeated attacks at Escape the Fate but disliked the album's lyrical quality. The resulting score was an 8.9 out of 10 possible, with the tracks [...] "I'm Not a Vampire", [...] "Good Girls Bad Guys", [...] "Pick Up the Phone", all pop tracks, being pointed out as particularly good. A Weekender correspondent noted that the album includes: [...] "Aggressive rock... metal and electronica into this collective mix of mayhem and definitely keeps listeners wondering <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> next." [...] Different parts of songs were complimented, such as the [...] "immense hooks... catchy choruses... vicious breakdowns", as well as Radke's lyrics being called [...] "witty and poetic". The correspondent's review further states, [...] "Radke has managed to imprint his dramatic personality into every aspect of 'The Drug In Me Is You.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Schexnayder of Jesus Freak Hideout gave {{a second}} staff opinion rating of three-stars-out-of-five, and wrote that [...] "Come To The Well {{is not an}} {{unbearable}} musical venture, and it’s likely one of their better recent releases. Although their music may not be of the highest quality, those looking for lyrics that go deeper than your average contemporary worship band should consider giving {{at least some of}} Casting Crowns’ latest a listen." [...] Davies of Louder Than the Music gave it a three and a half out of five stars, noting that [...] "there is absolutely nothing wrong with this album", which he expects more out of the band, advising that with [...] "a little bit more creativity musically and this could be a really strong album." [...] Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday gave it a four out of five stars, evoking how the album is [...] "filled with songs that both challenge and encourage believers in their walk", and calling it [...] "the best album by Casting Crowns since Lifesong". Bert Gangl of The Phantom Tollbooth gave it a three and a half out of five stars, writing that the album [...] "taken as a whole, the new record, in spite of its intermittent musical tangents – or perhaps because of them – winds up being one of the Crown collective's most cohesive, and impressive, releases to date." [...] Ed Cardinal of Crosswalk.com said the album was [...] "as strong and yet relatively safe as anything it has done before" [...] and praised it as [...] "sure to be among 2011’s most popular and enduring Christian albums". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel praised the album's songwriting and said the album [...] "is a solid effort in the Crowns discography". Barry Westman of Worship Leader praising the album for its [...] "variety in styles adds to the complexity of the album, and keeps the listener wondering <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> next." [...] At the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, the album received the award for Top Christian Album. Come to the Well has been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album at the 55th Grammy Awards, while [...] "Jesus, Friend of Sinners" [...] has received nominations for Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance and Best Contemporary Christian Music Song.|$|E

He is {{among the first to}} be quarantined along with his wife. Due to his medical expertise he has a certain authority among those quarantined. Much of this really comes from his wife not having gone blind; she is able to see what is going on on the ward and relay this to her husband. When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife's apartment. Several of the other main characters had been visiting the doctor's office when the epidemic begins to spread.|$|E
