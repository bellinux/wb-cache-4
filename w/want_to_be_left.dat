25|$|A {{particularly}} {{strong sense of}} folk faith {{is found in the}} tribal parts of Burma. In this instance, there is not some type of divine being, and folk religion is practised entirely separately from Buddhism. In these tribal societies all nats are traditionally viewed as harmful, unlike in other villages where nats are invited to partake in festivals. Instead of adorning these nats with offerings and food, the most effort is put into fending evil spirits off. These tribes just merely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> alone, undisturbed by the malicious spirits.|$|E
25|$|From around 1920, {{the company}} favoured {{a union of}} Southern and Northern Rhodesia, {{followed}} by their inclusion in the Union of South Africa, {{and it was in}} discussion with South African leaders about this. South Africa offered favourable terms for buying out the BSAC’s interests, and the company would be relieved of any future administrative costs. The BSAC did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> with responsibility for the administration of Northern Rhodesia when Southern Rhodesia gained responsible government, but did want to preserve its commercial interests there, in particular its mining and land rights. To do this, it had to negotiate a settlement with the British government for both parts of Rhodesia. The two parties began negotiations in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion at the end of 1922, but nevertheless reached an agreement of 29 September 1923 to settle all the outstanding questions on Southern and Northern Rhodesia.|$|E

500|$|As the {{territory}} developed, their tasks changed; slaves {{also served as}} household servants and farm workers, {{as in the case}} of William Henry Harrison's slaves. George Rogers Clark's two slaves assisted him in running a gristmill in Clarksville. While the pro-slavery faction was in power, laws were passed permitting anyone to seize and return slaves who were more than ten miles from their home, and a one hundred dollar fine was placed on anyone who helped a slave escape. Some slaves, like [...] "Aunt Fannie", who belonged to Dennis Pennington, refused to be set free. Pennington had freed all his slaves when he left Virginia, but Fannie did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> behind and continued on as a free household servant for the rest of her life. She was buried in the Pennington family cemetery in Corydon, Indiana. Others were not so fortunate {{as in the case of}} another black woman who also lived in Corydon. When she tried to escape from her masters she was run down in the street, beaten, and carried back home. The men threatened death to anyone in the town, which was strongly anti-slavery, who interfered.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{experts have}} found it {{difficult}} to argue that the Gulf Cartel does not impose a direct threat to the state, since they [...] "do not seek political change," [...] and that they only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> alone with their business. Observations indicate that the Gulf Cartel actually controls territories and imposes its own rules—often violent and bloody—over the population. And in doing so, they inherently become a [...] "competitor" [...] with the state, who also claims sovereignty over its territories. Like other drug trafficking organizations, the Gulf Cartel also subverts government institutions, particularly at state and local levels, by using their large profits to bribe officials.|$|E
