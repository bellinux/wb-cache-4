40|$|Reliable {{mechanical}} {{weed control}} requires knowledge of the achievable levels of weed control and crop damage when using certain implements in specific conditions. Quantitative methods that use weed, crop, soil, and cultivator characteristics to predict weed control and crop damage need to be developed. To that end, the relative susceptibility of weeds and crop plants to mechanical weeding and the selective ability of cultivators need to be quantified separately. The method presented in this study uses measured plant anchorage forces to quantify crop and weed sensitivity to being uprooted by a <b>weed</b> <b>harrow</b> and predicts the relationship between weed and crop uprooting by mechanical weeding. Uprooting and anchorage force of young perennial ryegrass and garden cress plants were measured in laboratory harrowing experiments on sandy soil. A nonlinear equation was introduced to describe the relationship between weed uprooting and crop uprooting. The parameters representing the selective potential of the actual crop-weed condition (K-pot) and the imlement selective ability (K-cult) did not depend on crop uprooting. The relationship between potential weed and crop uprooting that could theoretically be obtained by a perfectly selective implement (i. e., pulling each plant with equal force) was calculated from plant anchorage force distributions measured before harrowing. The observed uprooting percentages achieved by harrowing were lower than the potential uprooting percentages. With K-cult accounting for imperfect weeder selective ability, prediction accuracy was satisfactory. Field validation is required to confirm whether this method improves comparison and prediction of weeding performance of different weeding implements in different crop-weed situations...|$|E
40|$|Controlling weeds {{in spring}} cereals grown under organic {{conditions}} is mostly done by post emergence weed harrowing, where spring tines of the <b>weed</b> <b>harrow</b> control weeds by uprooting and/or covering small weeds plants with soil. In situations with relatively large weed plants and relatively small crop plants, there are increased risks for crop damages by soil coverage or other mechanical damages {{of the crop}} leaves. These damages are increasing with increasing weed control intensity, and are resulting in reduced crop growth immediately after weed harrowing. There are risks that the reduced growth reduces final crop yield too. However, {{there is some evidence}} that there are varietal differences in the tolerance to weed harrowing. The aim of this study was to estimate the damages by weed harrowing in four pure genotypes and three two- or one three-component mixtures of spring barley, and to analyze if there were differences in tolerance to weed harrowing between the genotypes and mixtures. Results from a two-year field study showed that there were varietal differences in the tolerance to mechanical weed control in the immediate effect as well as the short term effect, however there were marked differences in the immediate and short term effect between the two years. Regarding the long term effect of weed harrowing on yield, there were no significant differences in 2003 but in 2004, Brazil and the three component mixture suffered significantly from weed harrowing while Modena, Otira and Modena+Orthega mixture, seems to benefit from weed harrowing. The reason for these differences is probably due to differences in growth habit at the time for weed harrowing. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{report shows}} that weed {{harrowing}} in organic cereal fields is an efficient alternative to herbicides since weed harrowing does not reduce yields compared to weed-free plots. Arable weeds provide resources and habitat to many organisms. However, weeds {{are the most}} important constraint to crop production. Indeed, the potential crop losses of the eight major crops due to weed–crop competition amount to about 30  %. New ways of food production are needed due to the current severe biodiversity decline, about 1, 000 times higher than the natural rate of species loss, and the growing food demands. Herbicides are highly efficient at reducing crop losses due to weed–crop competition, but at the expense of declining biodiversity. Studies have shown a poor efficiency of <b>weed</b> <b>harrows</b> in terms of weed reduction in organic farming systems. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of <b>weed</b> <b>harrows</b> in organic fields to reduce weeds to a threshold that does not limit crop production, while maintaining a rich flora. The results were compared to results obtained using herbicides in conventionally managed fields. Eleven organic and conventional cereal field pairs in Catalonia, Spain, were evaluated for one season in 2006 – 2007. Three different weed control treatments were applied: weed-free plots; weed-controlled plots, using herbicide in conventional fields and weed harrowing in organic ones and non-weeded plots. Crop yield and the abundance, richness and composition of the weed flora, which was dominated by ryegrass and poppies, were evaluated. Our results show that weed harrowing prevents weeds from being a limiting factor of crop productivity in organic cereal fields, since weed-controlled plots did not reduce yields compared to weed-free plots. A similar trend was observed in herbicide-controlled plots. However, herbicides diminished weed species richness in approximately 47  % and changed the species composition whereas harrowing allowed the maintenance of high levels of weed diversity in the organic fields...|$|R
40|$|Improvement of intra-row {{mechanical}} {{weed control}} is important to reduce the reliance on herbicides in arable crops and vegetables. Covering weeds by soil is an important weed control mechanism of <b>weed</b> <b>harrows.</b> A shallow post-emergence <b>harrow</b> cultivation controls <b>weeds</b> but also damages the crop to some extent. This paper explores how plants get covered by soil and how a plant’s resistance against being covered is related to its height, flexibility and shape of leaves. Seedlings of two contrasting species were sown in bins filled with a sandy soil and harrowed by a small model harrow in the laboratory. Covering selectivity (percentage covered ryegrass/percentage covered garden cress) could be influenced by soil moisture content, working depth and working speed. Differences in covering were related to spatial patterns of plant downward bending and soil surface level upheaval. These patterns are associated with soil failure patterns near tines and soil flow patterns, connected with different effects of plant height and plant flexibility. This study indicates that relationships between weed control and crop covering may not only depend on weed and crop characteristics but also on soil conditions and implement settings. As less than 10 % of the covered plants were buried deeper than 15 mm, covering would mainly cause growth reduction and little killing. Limited burial depth {{may be an important}} cause for limited weed control effectiveness of harrowing...|$|R
40|$|Non-chemical {{methods for}} weed control play an {{important}} role for the management of weeds in organic cropping systems in Europe. With the expansion of the organic area in recent years, more research has been conducted to develop new methods and improve management strategies. Currently, <b>weed</b> <b>harrows,</b> rotary cultivators and inter-row cultivators are the principal methods used for full-width treatments in large agricultural crops, such as cereals, oil seed rape, maize and pulses. The mechanical methods are often combined with cultural measures, e. g. stale seedbeds, delayed sowing, placement of fertilizers etc., to benefit from the additive and sometimes even synergistic effects of combining direct and cultural methods. In row crops, such as sugar beets and horticultural crops, thermal and mechanical methods are mostly combined to remove as many weeds in the rows as possible in order to minimize the need for manual weeding. Weeds growing between the rows are easily controlled by inter-row cultivation. Robotic weeding for intra-row weed control is now possible for transplanted crops, and inter-row hoes have been equipped with GPS-systems and cameras for optimizing precision and steering. Works on new GPS technology is currently focusing on seeding systems with the ability to create parallel or diamond crop establishment patterns, which enable inter-row hoeing to be conducted in different directions. So far, non-chemical methods have had little uptake in conventional farming but national and EU-based legislative initiatives may change the situation radically in the near future. Several European countries have launched pesticide action plans and the EU a new directive for the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM); all aiming for minimizing the reliance on herbicides. This is expected to accentuate the need for non-chemical methods...|$|R
40|$|There is much {{emphasis}} on technical aspects related to sensor or mapping techniques, which enable so-called intelligent cultivators to target the intra-row spaces within crop rows. This study investigates (i) an expected advantage of an intelligent rotor tine cultivator (the cycloid hoe) in terms of crop-weed selectivity and (ii) an expected synergistic effect between punch planting and post-emergence weed harrowing in terms of improved crop-weed selectivity. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} relationship between weed control and associated crop density decline one week after cultivation, and punch planting is a sowing technique where holes are created in the ground with a minimum of soil disturbance and seeds are inserted into them, without soil disturbance outside the holes. Two experiments were carried out with the cycloid hoe in organic sugar beets. The rotation tines were guided by RTK-GPS relative to geo-referenced sugar beets, and tines were moved into the row when there was enough space between crop plants to cultivate, and kept outside, when they were predicted to strike a crop plant. The selectivity of the cycloid hoe was tested against two machine variants without intelligent guidance: the rotor tine cultivator in a locked mode, where tines rotate within the crop row without taking crop plants into consideration, and an ordinary flex tine <b>weed</b> <b>harrow.</b> The experiments showed no differences between the three machine variants in terms of selectivity. Five experiments with punch planting in sugar beets and carrots showed no synergistic effects between plant establishment procedures and selectivity of post-emergence weed harrowing. Even if punch planting and automated intelligent rotor tine cultivation were not combined, the results indicate that {{there is no reason to}} believe that a combination contributes significantly to the solution of the main problem in mechanical intra-row weed control in direct sown crops, low selectivity, which still remains a major challenge. Future studies on precision intra-row cultivation should focus on cutting implements instead of tine implements which manly works through soil burial...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to obtained information about the interaction of flexible tines and soil for mechanical weeding. Due {{to the fact that}} chemical weeding has negative effects on the environment, mechanical weeding is widely used today as an alternative and more sustainable solution. The complexity of soil-tine interaction, with flexible tines, makes it highly difficult to extract the needed information from experimental works only. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} obtain extended knowledge about optimal design parameters (rake angle and tine geometry) and operational conditions (working depth and bulk density) for optimal soil disturbance and least energy consumption, by the use of numerical finite element computer simulation. To achieve this, a test bench was designed to study different tine designs and operational conditions of selected flexible tines, provided by Einböck, an Austrian manufacturer of <b>weed</b> <b>harrows.</b> The results of the test bench were mainly used to validate the established finite element model, which enabled a more informed analysis of the weeding process. Furthermore, soil parameters and soil-metal properties needed as input for the FEM simulation were determined by standard laboratory tests. Results showed that FEM is an acceptable and cost effective alternative to experiments. The simulation errors for draught and upward tine tip movement were generally smaller than 15 % and 10 %, respectively. Software associated limitations were experienced to model the entire working process satisfactorily, for instance no crack propagation in soils could be taken into account so far. Nevertheless, it was possible to simulate the first soil-tine interaction contact. This was sufficient to optimise tine design parameters and operational conditions, which was considered a cost effective method for the manufacturing of prototypes. From the FEM simulation and soil bin test, it could be concluded that a stiffer tine with a higher torsion spring constant and a small rake angle should be used when less variation in working depth and more aggressive weeding is required. Otherwise, trailing positions should be used, if a shallow working depth is desired, to achieve higher soil disturbance in the surface for smaller draught requirements...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the tolerance to weed harrowing of four spring barley varieties {{and examined the}} possible interactions between varietal weed suppressive ability and two nutrient levels. Tolerance {{was defined as the}} combined effect of crop resistance (ability to resist soil covering) and crop recovery (the ability to recover in terms of yield). The weed harrowing strategy was a combination of one pre- and one post-emergence weed harrowing. In terms of yield, the four varieties responded significantly differently to weed harrowing and the response depended on nutrient level. At the lower nutrient level, weed harrowing caused an increase in yield of 4. 4 hkg ha- 1 for a strong competitor (cv. Otira), while there was no effect on yield at the higher nutrient level. For a weaker competitor (cv. Brazil), weed harrowing caused no change in yield at the lower nutrient level, whereas yield decreased by 6. 0 hkg ha- 1 at the higher nutrient level. There were marked differences between the weed suppressive ability of the four varieties when not harrowed, with less pronounced but significant differences when <b>harrowed.</b> <b>Weed</b> harrowing did not change the weed suppressive ability of a variety. Varieties that are tall at post-emergence harrowing and have increased density after pre-emergence harrowing, are the ones that benefit most from weed harrowing...|$|R
40|$|Intercropping field {{experiments}} with maize and Phaseolus beans are {{conducted at the}} Thünen-Institute of Organic Farming (Schleswig-Holstein, SL, 740 mm, 8. 7 °C) from 2014 - 2016. As known from previous experiments, maize and beans have a very low competitiveness against weeds, due to their relative slow youth development. Therefore, the beans were sown subsequently to the mechanical <b>weed</b> control with <b>harrow</b> and hoe, at the 4 -leaf development stage (BBCH 14) of maize. Hence a mechanical weed control after bean emergence is critical, a field experiment is conducted {{to find out whether}} the establishment of an additional catch crop can reduce weed pressure substantially. For this purpose two catch crop mixtures are evaluated in pure maize plots as well as in intercropping plots with scarlet runner beans (Phaseolus coccineus, cv. Preisgewinner) or common runner beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, cv. Tarbais) respectively. As control variants, plots without undersown crops were used. The undersown crop mixtures are composed of Italian ryegrass (cv. Gersimi, sowing density: 15 kg ha- 1), which is combined with subterranean clover (cv. Seaton Park, sowing density: 30 kg ha- 1) in US 1 and with Chicory (cv. Puna II, sowing density 7. 5 kg ha- 1) in US 2. The highest biomass (50 g DM m- 2) was produced by US 1 in all variants, while the biomass of US 2 was significantly lower with 32 g DM m- 2. As a result of a successful mechanical weed control as well as a good development of the main crops, the weed pressure in 2014 was generally low. Nevertheless, the results show that undersown crops can reduce weeds substantially. While the significantly highest weed biomass was recorded in the plots without undersown crops, it was reduced by 70...|$|R
40|$|Side {{effects of}} {{herbicides}} and increasing prevalence of organic farming nduce {{the need of}} further developments in mechanical weed control. Mechanical weed control is mainly associated with cultivating tillage (e. g. tertiary tillage), but also primary and secondary tillage influence weeds. Cultivating tillage is performed in growing crops with harrows, hoes, brushes {{and a number of}} special tools for intra-row weed control. Inter-row cultivations have been used in many decades in row crops and perform in general well. To increase their capacity and accuracy, guidance systems are important to steer the hoes along the rows. The success of inter- and intra-row cultivation is highly influenced by selectivity factors. The control mechanisms of all cultivating tillage methods are burring in soil, uprooting,and tearing plants into pieces. Especially for whole crop and intra-row cultivators, successful weed control is highly influenced by appropriate adjustment of the intensity (aggressiveness) of cultivation according to the variations of soil resistance, crop and weed resistance to cultivation and the competitive interactions between crop and weeds. Site-specific weed management aims to identify the spatial and temporal variability of weeds and manage them correspondingly. New technologies for sensing crops and weeds in real-time and robotics allow a precise operation of mechanical tools, to improve efficacy of control and reduce operation costs. Hence in this chapter, implements for mechanical weeding are described together with their options for site-specific <b>weed</b> control strategies. <b>Harrows</b> and rotary hoes are used for whole crop treatment, but it is essential to find the right timing and intensity to obtain the best selectivity and yield response. Different implements attached to the same vehicle are combined together attempting more selective weed control,like the in-row cultivator, the rotary harrow, and the precision hoe. Lately, there are prototypes intending automatic adjustment of the aggressiveness for the springtine harrow and autonomous guidance for hoes, thus getting closer to a real-time site-specific weed management approach...|$|R
