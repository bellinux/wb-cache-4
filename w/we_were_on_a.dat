500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trip when we made it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles—partitions separating the musicians {{so that there}} was [...] "an ambience fit for an ensemble". Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, [...] "as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart". Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions.|$|E

John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said, ‘You want to use my tuner?’ He said, ‘No, I’ll bend it in.’ It was so far out. Then we jammed but it didn’t come to anything. Maybe he wasn’t in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didn’t quite happen but it could have worked." ...|$|E

500|$|Beginning on 1 June, {{the first}} track to be {{recorded}} was [...] "Us and Them", followed six days later by [...] "Money". [...] Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded {{to take advantage of}} the band's decision to record a quadraphonic mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders). [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] were the next pieces {{to be recorded}}, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US. [...] The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. [...] Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: [...] "We would sometimes watch them but when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> roll, we would get on." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaushik and {{his team}} taught the crew [...] "all [...] knew about hockey". In an interview, he later said that he [...] "taught him (Sahni) {{everything}} about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he [...] "trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [...] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very hard. I salute them". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned [...] "including the penalty stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen {{that it should be}} very realistic. I took the help of a lot of my former teammates. But more importantly, it was so easy working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted".|$|E
500|$|Crane and Kauffman {{strongly}} envisioned Friends as {{an ensemble}} comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed {{the show as}} such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms {{at the time to}} be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are [...] "of equal importance." [...] As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because [...] "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." [...] Kauffman echoed [...] "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." [...] The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten– approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the [...] "Rachel" [...] and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, [...] "I wanted it to end when people still loved us and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do I have in me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.|$|E

Only 12 episodes aired on CBS between September 18, 1982, and September 3, 1983. In the episode [...] "Let Sleeping Minnows Lie", they travel to an island, get shipwrecked there, and Gilligan observes, [...] "First <b>we</b> <b>were</b> stranded <b>on</b> <b>an</b> island, then <b>we</b> <b>were</b> stranded <b>on</b> <b>a</b> planet, and now we're stranded <b>on</b> <b>an</b> island <b>on</b> <b>a</b> planet." ...|$|R

So play trends changed, and we failed to change. We were not making toys that were sufficiently interesting to children. We failed to innovate enough.

But John lost the ball over the line and our hopes disappeared with that lost, bouncing ball. The Blacks, typically, made good their fortune by getting down to the other end and scoring the points which made such they clinced not only the Test but also the series. Another series against New Zealand had gone west; we were plunged into the ultimate depression." ...|$|E

30|$|Perplexing is {{the fact}} that PD- 1 and CTLA- 4 {{checkpoint}} inhibitors, even when helped by cancer vaccines, are not effective against all cancer types, nor do they work in every patient with the same cancer. Perhaps other immune cell types are negatively affecting cancer immunotherapy? The explanation we put forward to explain this dilemma is that in some cancers we have the machinery (the car) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> downhill slope, so if we release the brake (immune checkpoint inhibitors) the car can move. In contrast, when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> uphill slope or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plain field, releasing the brake simply does not move the car. For such scenarios, we have to release the brake and push the accelerator.|$|R
