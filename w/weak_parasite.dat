5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae grows {{upon the}} wood of {{deciduous}} trees and shrubs, favouring elder. In up to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder. It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a <b>weak</b> <b>parasite</b> (on living wood), and it causes white rot.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{epidemiology}} {{and significance of}} the parasitic fungus Sphaeropsis sapinea in Serbia and Montenegro shows that some parasitic and saprophytic fungi occur {{in connection with this}} pathogen. Among the 13 identified species, the most frequent are Truncatella hartigi and Cenangium accum. Dothistroma septospora is a fungus with the most expressed pathogenic properties among those that colonize Austrian pine needles. A new data is that the above two fungi can occur also on the needles of the same current-year shoots, i. e. that D. septospora can be in succession with S. sapinea when it colonizes the needles on the shoots which were previously infected by S. sapinea.

40|$|Understanding how parasites {{adapt to}} changes in host {{resistance}} is crucial to evolutionary epidemiology. Experimental {{studies have demonstrated that}} parasites are more capable of adapting to gradual, rather than sudden changes in host phenotype, as the latter may require multiple mutations that are unlikely to arise simultaneously. A key, but as yet unexplored factor is precisely how interactions between mutations (epistasis) affect parasite evolution. Here, we investigate this phenomenon in the context of infectivity range, where parasites may experience selection to infect broader sets of genotypes. When epistasis is strongly positive, we find that parasites are unlikely to evolve broader infectivity ranges if hosts exhibit sudden, rather than gradual changes in phenotype, in close agreement with empirical observations. This is due to a low probability of fixing multiple mutations that individually confer no immediate advantage. When epistasis is <b>weaker,</b> <b>parasites</b> are more likely to evolve broader infectivity ranges if hosts make sudden changes in phenotype, which can be explained by a balance between mutation supply and selection. Thus, we demonstrate that both the rate of phenotypic change in hosts and the form of epistasis between mutations in parasites are crucial in shaping the evolution of infectivity range...|$|R

40|$|Tropospheric ozone (O 3) is {{the most}} {{important}} air pollutant because of its effects on forests and relationships with climate change. Results obtained by IPP-CNR in recent years suggest Mediterranean forests are less O 3 sensitive than they were thought before. This does not imply that Mediterranean forests are free of any O 3 damage. Visible foliar injury, stomatal alterations (increased night-time transpiration, delayed closure in response to water and light variations), increased susceptibility to other stressors (drought, <b>weak</b> <b>parasites)</b> as well as background O 3 levels exceeding European standards, confirm O 3 pollution as a serious concern to Italian forests. To protect forests from O 3 effects, Europe uses one only exposure index, i. e. AOT 40, for the entire continent. Researchers now know that O 3 exposure does not summarize the real potential of O 3 injury to vegetation. A new concept of "flux" has been developing and includes avoidance through stomatal closure and tolerance through detoxification and damage repair. Validating the O 3 flux approach implies a great deal of scientific effort. Meanwhile, different AOT 40 thresholds on a geographic or plant-type basis may be tested...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, fungi {{associated}} with larvae {{of the biological}} control agent Cactoblastis cactorum {{may contribute to the}} control of the exotic weed pricklypear (Opuntia inermis), C, cactorum larvae were assessed for their ability to vector pathogenic fungi into O, inermis by the infestation of larvae with fungal suspensions. Six fungal isolates caused disease after being carried into the host on external surfaces of larvae, and propagules of one isolate (UQ 5109) initiated disease after being transferred from the cladode epidermis into the host by larvae feeding on the plant. Scanning electron microscopy revealed extensive hyphal growth on the external surfaces of larvae infested with several of the isolates. Fungi isolated from field-grown O, inermis cladodes were tested for pathogenicity to this plant in an in vivo plant assay. In total, 152 isolates were screened, 22 of which infected the host in pathogenicity tests. Only 1 (UQ 5115) infected undamaged host tissue, whereas the remainder required the host to be wounded before infection could proceed. The majority of isolates were only weakly pathogenic, even when inoculated via wounds, suggesting that most were either saprophytes or <b>weak</b> <b>parasites.</b> This study demonstrates that it is possible for larvae of C, cactorum to transmit fungal pathogens into O, inermis tissue and it has provided a sound basis for future field work to determine the contribution that fungi make to the control of O. inermis, (C) 2001 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|One-year-old {{cork oak}} (Quercus suber) and turkey oak (Q. cerris) {{seedlings}} {{were exposed to}} ozone (110 ppb, 5 h dayË— 1, for 30 days) and were inoculated with Diplodia corticola and Biscogniauxia mediterranea, respectively, by spraying a suspension of spores on the leaves. Both fungi are endophytic and may act as <b>weak</b> <b>parasites,</b> contributing to oak decline. Ozone exposure stimulated leaf attacks after inoculation, although the physiological, visible, and structural responses of both oaks to O 3 exposure were weak. In fact, steady-state gas exchange, leaf waxes, and wettability were not significantly affected by O 3. In Q. cerris, O 3 altered the structure of stomata, as observed by scanning microscopy, and reduced the leaf relative water content. No hyphal entry through stomata or growth towards stomata was, however, observed. Inoculations were performed in a humid chamber at low light; stomata {{were likely to be}} closed. When Q. cerris was inoculated in natural conditions, i. e., in a forest infected by B. mediterranea, seedlings pre-exposed to the enhanced O 3 regime had a higher number of B. mediterranea isolates than the controls. This suggests that pre-exposure to O 3 predisposed Q. cerris leaves to attacks by B. mediterranea independent of stomata. The hyphae of both fungi were able to enter the leaf through the cuticle, either by gradual in-growth into the cuticle or erosion of a hollow in the cuticle at the point of contact. The primary cause of increased leaf injury in O 3 -exposed seedlings appeared to be higher germination of spores than on control leaves...|$|R

50|$|Typically, N. cinnabarina grows as a {{saprophyte}} on dead wood. If a {{plant is}} wounded, the pathogen becomes an opportunistic <b>weak</b> <b>parasite</b> and infects susceptible plants. The complex {{life cycle of}} the N. cinnabarina would be characterized as polycyclic because {{it is capable of}} several infection cycles. During spring or early summer, coral pink or light purplish red spore-producing structures form. These age to tan or brown. This is the sexual stage and is distinguished by the aforementioned pink structures, which are tough perithecia that produce sexual spores. Because N. cinnabarina has sporodochial anamorphs, the perithecia form within the sporodochium. In summer and autumn, orange-red fruiting structures are produced; eventually these structures mature to dark red and can survive through the winter. This is the asexual stage and it is characterized by spongy conidia which can be distinguished by the hard, dark red blobs on the bark. Both of these structures release spores that can be dispersed by water and invade susceptible tissue.|$|E

In this study, detached twigs inoculated with conidia were readily colonized and produced large numbers of pycnidia within 30 to 40 days when they were soaked 3 to 4 h on alternate days. Conidial production was measured by wetting twigs in a rain tower periodically and collecting the conidia in the runoff water. Production began after 80 days and continued for nearly 300 days. In other experiments, production of mature pycnidia on detached twigs was greatest at 94 to 100 % relative humidity (RH) and at 28 degrees C. Low RH and temperature, however, favored survival of conidia in exuded masses on twigs. In the field, colonization of detached twigs by D. citri was high in rainy season, moderate in spring and early fall, and minimal in late fall and winter.

The effectiveness of 11 ARF isolates was compared by introducing homogenized mycelium into heat-treated soil. Soybean seedlings were transplanted into pots containing fungus-infested soil and inoculated with H. glycines. After 30 or 60 days, the number of nematodes and the percentage of parasitized eggs were determined. Three isolates (907, 908, and TN 14), which were previously reported to be <b>weak</b> egg <b>parasites</b> in vitro, consistently suppressed nematode numbers by 50 % to 100 %. Of the isolates previously reported to be aggressive egg parasites, four (903, BG 2, MS 3, and TN 12) reduced nematode numbers by 56 % to 69 % in at least one experimental trial, but the other four had no effect on nematode numbers. When the efficacy of isolate TN 14 was tested in heat-treated and native soil, nematode suppression was greater in the heat-treated soil in only one of two trials. In both soil treatments, nematode numbers were reduced by more than 60 %.

40|$|To develop public-health {{policies}} that extend the lifespan of affordable anti-malarial drugs as effective treatment options, {{it is necessary}} to understand the evolutionary processes leading to the origin and spread of mutations conferring drug resistance in malarial parasites. We built a population-genetic model for the emergence of resistance under combination drug therapy. Reproductive cycles of parasites are specified by their absolute fitness determined by clinical parameters, thus coupling the evolutionary-genetic with population-dynamic processes. Initial mutations confer only partial drug-resistance. Therefore, mutant parasites rarely survive combination therapy and within-host competition is very <b>weak</b> among <b>parasites.</b> The model focuses on the early phase of such unsuccessful recurrent mutations. This ends in the rare event of mutants enriching in an infected individual from which the successful spread of resistance over the entire population is initiated. By computer simulations, the waiting time until the establishment of resistant parasites is analysed. Resistance spreads quickly following the first appearance of a host infected predominantly by mutant parasites. This occurs either through a rare transmission of a resistant parasite to an uninfected host or through a rare failure of drugs in removing "transient" mutant alleles. The emergence of resistance is delayed with lower mutation rate, earlier treatment, higher metabolic cost of resistance, longer duration of high drug dose, and higher drug efficacy causing a stronger reduction in the sensitive and resistant parasites' fitnesses. Overall, contrary to other studies' proposition, the current model based on absolute fitness suggests that aggressive drug treatment delays the emergence of drug resistance...|$|R

Direct, observation-based detection of the parasite is time consuming and destructive, as large parts of the rootstocks have to be uprooted and screened for the tiny, stipitate, hypogeous ascomata of R. subterranea. To facilitate rapid detection in vineyards, protocols to extract DNA from soil samples and grapevine roots, and R. -subterranea- specific PCR primers were designed. Twelve DNA-extraction protocols for soil samples were tested in small-scale experiments, and selected parameters were optimised.

A total of 92 isolates representing six Fusarium species were recovered from O. australiensis. Taxa were delimited based on morphological and phylogenetic (TEF- 1 Î± sequence) characters and identified as F. incarnatum-equiseti species complex (55 %), Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC, 27 %), F. longipes (14 %) and an unidentified Fusarium sp.

No isolates were identified as F. fujikuroi, the cause of Bakanae disease of rice in south-east Asia and other rice growing regions. Morphological, phylogenetic and phenetic (AFLP) analyses were in accordance, differentiating all F. sacchari isolates from other Fusarium taxa. The ratio of F. sacchari mating types (15 MAT- 1 : 9 MAT- 2) in the O. australiensis population was {{not significantly different from}} that expected under random mating (1 : 1). The effective population number (Ne) based on mating type (Ne(mt)) was 94 % of the count (total population). In contrast, that based on female-fertile isolates (Ne(f)) was 15 %, implying low frequencies of sexual reproduction among F. sacchari isolates. Pathogenicities of three F. sacchari genotypes were assessed against O. australiensis and commercial cultivars of rice, sorghum and maize. All F. sacchari isolates significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) reduced emergence of O. australiensis and rice, but not sorghum or maize.

Thus, parasites may influence host life-history characteristics, such as longevity, and simultaneously host life-history may influence parasite diversity. If parasite burden causes increased mortality, we expect a negative association between host longevity and parasite species richness. Alternatively, if long-lived species represent a more stable environment for parasite establishment, host longevity and parasite species richness may show a positive association. We tested these two opposing predictions in carnivores, primates and terrestrial ungulates using phylogenetic comparative methods and controlling for the potentially confounding effects of sampling effort and body mass. We also tested whether increased host longevity is associated with increased immunity, using {{white blood cell counts}} as a proxy for immune investment. Our analyses revealed <b>weak</b> relationships between <b>parasite</b> species richness and longevity. We found a significant negative relationship between longevity and parasite species richness for ungulates, but no significant associations in carnivores or primates. We also found no evidence for a relationship between immune investment and host longevity in any of our three groups. Our results suggest that greater parasite burden is linked to higher host mortality in ungulates. Thus, shorter-lived ungulates may be more vulnerable to disease outbreaks, which has implications for ungulate conservation, and may be applicable to other short...|$|R
40|$|Parasitism {{is widely}} viewed as the primary cost of sociality and a {{constraint}} on group size, yet studies report varied associations between group size and parasitism. Using the largest database of its kind, we performed a meta-analysis of 69 studies {{of the relationship between}} group size and parasite risk, as measured by parasitism and immune defenses. We predicted a positive correlation between group size and parasitism with organisms that show contagious and environmental transmission and a negative correlation for searching parasites, parasitoids, and possibly vector-borne parasites (on the basis of the encounter-dilution effect). Overall, we found a positive effect of group size (r = 0. 187) that varied in magnitude across transmission modes and measures of parasite risk, with only weak indications of publication bias. Among different groups of hosts, we found a stronger relationship between group size and parasite risk in birds than in mammals, which may be driven by ecological and social factors. A metaregression showed that effect sizes increased with maximum group size. Phylogenetic meta-analyses revealed no evidence for phylogenetic signal in the strength of the group size-parasitism relationship. We conclude that group size is a <b>weak</b> predictor of <b>parasite</b> risk except in species that live in large aggregations, such as colonial birds, in which effect sizes are larger.

40|$|African trypanosomes {{thrive in}} the {{bloodstream}} and tissue spaces {{of a wide range}} of mammalian hosts. Infections of cattle cause an enormous socio-economic burden in sub-Saharan Africa. A hallmark of the trypanosome lifestyle is the flagellateâ€™s incessant motion. This work details the cell motility behavior of the four livestock-parasites Trypanosoma vivax, T. brucei, T. evansi and T. congolense. The trypanosomes feature distinct swimming patterns, speeds and flagellar wave frequencies, although the basic mechanism of flagellar propulsion is conserved, as is shown by extended single flagellar beat analyses. Three-dimensional analyses of the trypanosomes expose a high degree of dynamic pleomorphism, typified by the â€˜cellular waveformâ€™. This is a product of the flagellar oscillation, the chirality of the flagellum attachment and the stiffness of the trypanosome cell body. The waveforms are characteristic for each trypanosome species and are influenced by changes of the microenvironment, such as differences in viscosity and the presence of confining obstacles. The distinct cellular waveforms may be reflective of the actual anatomical niches the parasites populate within their mammalian host. T. vivax displays waveforms optimally aligned to the topology of the bloodstream, while the two subspecies T. brucei and T. evansi feature distinct cellular waveforms, both additionally adapted to motion in more confined environments such as tissue spaces. T. congolense reveals a small and stiff waveform, which makes these <b>parasites</b> <b>weak</b> swimmers and destined for cell adherence in low flow areas of the circulation. Thus, our experiments show that the differential dissemination and annidation of trypanosomes in their mammalian hosts may depend on the distinct swimming capabilities of the parasites...|$|R
40|$|Parasite {{virulence}} {{has been}} hypothesised to increase with {{the degree of}} host sociality because highly social hosts have a greater probability of encountering horizontal transmission of parasites and experiencing infections with multiple strains of the same parasites than do solitary hosts. As compared with the defences of closely related social host species, we predicted that solitary hosts should have relatively <b>weak</b> defences against <b>parasites,</b> thus being relatively more affected when parasitised by a novel parasite. We tested this prediction by either experimentally infesting 12 nests of the solitarily nesting red-rumped swallow Hirundo daurica with 50 individuals of the generalist martin bug Oeciacus hirundinis or by fumigation of nine nests. Nestlings 13 days old from the parasite addition group experienced increased mortality, attained lower body mass and tended to have shorter tarsi compared to nestlings from fumigated nests. Surprisingly, nestlings from the parasite addition group had higher packed cell volume (cellular fraction of blood) {{and lower levels of}} heat shock proteins (HSP 60) than nestlings from the fumigation group. A measure of immunocompetence was not significantly affected by treatment, but its magnitude was positively related to packed cell volume and negatively related to level of HSP 60. Solitary hosts like the red-rumped swallow have weak immune responses and low levels of heat shock proteins when infested with ectoparasites while highly social hosts have strong immune responses and high levels of heat shock proteins when infested. These findings partially support the hypothesis that potential host species with weak defences are more susceptible to infection and the deleterious effects of evolving parasites than potential hosts with strong defencesThis study was funded by an ATIPE BLANCHE from CNRS (A.

40|$|Abstract Food {{limitation}} {{can reduce}} reproductive suc-cess directly, {{as well as}} indirectly, if foraging imposes a risk of predation or parasitism. The solitary bee Osmia pumila suffers brood parasitism by the cleptoparasitic wasp Sapyga centrata, which enters the host nest to oviposit while the female bee is away. I studied foraging and reproduction of O. pumila nesting within cages stocked with rich or sparse floral resources, and {{the presence or absence}} of S. centrata to test (1) the response of nesting female O. pumila to food shortages, (2) the response of nesting female O. pumila to the presence of parasites, and (3) whether brood produced under scarce resources are more likely to be parasitized by S. centrata. The rate of brood cell production was significantly lower in cages with sparse floral resources, although females in sparse cages did not produce significantly fewer brood cells overall. Sapyga centrata did not influence the rate of brood cell production, but females exposed to the cleptoparasites had marginally significantly lower repro-ductive output. Nests in parasite cages had significantly fewer brood cells than those in parasite free cages. The mean duration of foraging bouts made by female O. pumila in sparse cages was not significantly longer than that in rich cages. O. pumila spent less time in the nest between pollen and nectar foraging bouts in sparse cages with S. centrata than those in other cages suggesting that these individuals made more frequent food foraging trips. Despite the <b>weak</b> effects of <b>parasites</b> and bloom density on foraging behavior, O. pumila brood cells experienced a 15 -fold higher probability of parasitism by S. centrata in cages with sparse bloom than in those with rich bloom. These results support the hypothesis that indirect effects of food scarcity increase O. pumila susceptibility to brood parasitism, although the exact mechanism is not entirely clear yet.
