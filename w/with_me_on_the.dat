It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E

The only track that was left off {{the final version of the}} release is Butch Vig's remix of [...] "Last" [...] (the outro of the [...] "Last" [...] remix is heard in [...] "Throw This Away", which also includes Vig's remix of [...] "Suck"). [...] The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11kHz file, [...] "NIN_LAST.AIFF", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). [...] Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying [...] "I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remix, in the very early days of Garbage." ...|$|E

It was nominated in the category of Award for Best Original Song at the 68th Golden Globe Awards in January 2011. In an interview with VEVO, Aguilera explained the collaborative process between Furler and herself, and why she likes to work with her: Sia and I always done amazing collaborations, she worked <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> movie soundtrack 'Burlesque,' which we got a Golden Globe nomination for, we also did a lot of work on my 'Bionic' record, that was so sentimental, intimate and vulnerable feeling, and that's what I love about working with her". Aguilera was interviewed by Billboard when she attended the Billboard Film & TV Music Conference. She revealed that she views [...] "Blank Page" [...] as a more [...] "vulnerable" [...] version of her 2002 song, [...] "Beautiful". When she was asked by the interviewer who her favorite people were to collaborate with, she responded by solely mentioning Furler and explained what led to her to enjoy working with her: ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] For Ludwig I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that he was afraid to walk alone <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before I discovered that the old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E
