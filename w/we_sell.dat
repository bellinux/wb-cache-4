Then the musicians were asked what they play and they say sitar, sarangi and drums. The poet even comes across magicians and asks them what they are chanting and they say that they are chanting magical spells to charm thousand ages to come.|$|E

He can head the ball, he's as strong as an ox, he can run, dribble and shoot. Most important of all, he's a smashing lad.|$|E
500|$|In construing {{the concept}} of {{equality}} in Article 12, the Court held that equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Chief Justice Yong Pung How arrived at this conclusion by considering the history that underpinned the notion of equality. The Court traced the origin of Article 12 back to the 40th article of the Magna Carta which reads, [...] "To none will <b>we</b> <b>sell,</b> to none will we deny, to none will we delay right or justice." ...|$|E

Despite not wanting to act, Hakim was afraid to be impolite to the endearing Karya and did not refuse. She later described it as being [...] "reeled in, slowly, slowly, like by a fisherman". The casting of Hakim did {{not sit well with}} the producer, who considered her too thin and her chest too small. Karya defended his choice, replying [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>selling</b> a film or are <b>we</b> <b>selling</b> breasts?" ...|$|R

500|$|In his speeches, Morales {{presented}} the coca leaf {{as a symbol}} of Andean culture that was under threat from the imperialist oppression of the U.S. In his view, the U.S. should deal with their domestic cocaine abuse problems without interfering in Bolivia, arguing that they had no right trying to eliminate coca, a legitimate product with many uses which played a rich role in Andean culture. In a speech on this issue, Morales told reporters [...] "I am not a drug trafficker. I am a coca grower. I cultivate coca leaf, which is a natural product. I do not refine (it into) cocaine, and neither cocaine nor drugs have ever been part of the Andean culture." [...] On another, he asserted that [...] "We produce our coca, we bring it to the main markets, <b>we</b> <b>sell</b> it and that's where our responsibility ends." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1998 {{decision}} Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong, the Court of Appeal {{regarded the}} concept of equality {{as a component of}} the wider doctrine of the rule of law, and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states: [...] "To none will <b>we</b> <b>sell,</b> to none will we deny, to none will we delay right or justice." [...] Article 12(1) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying [...] "to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws", and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying [...] "to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India". Article 12(1) is identical to Article 8(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, from which it was adopted following Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965.|$|E
500|$|U2 manager Paul McGuinness confessed {{anxiety over}} initial ticket sales taking {{place during the}} late 2000s recession. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "Will <b>we</b> <b>sell</b> it out? Who knows? Will the {{economic}} situation have an impact? Probably. But that's {{not going to stop}} us." [...] Bono said, [...] "I want to put on an extraordinary show, but I’d like to own my house when it's over." [...] The tour featured a tiered pricing system for tickets; the most expensive ticket being slightly higher in price than the last tour, but the cheapest tickets, the general admission tickets, being lower. Playing larger capacity venues allowed the band to price tickets more conservatively and subsidise less expensive tickets with costlier ones. In the US, field level tickets were priced at $55, and approximately 10,000 tickets per show were priced at $30. The price points were $30, $55, and depending on the market, $90–95 and $250. McGuinness said, [...] "We have worked very hard to ensure that U2 fans can purchase a great-priced ticket with a guaranteed great view." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, Hakim did {{not intend}} to be an actress, but an {{architect}} or psychologist. However, she was cast in Teguh Karya's 1973 film Cinta Pertama after he saw pictures of her modelling in a magazine; despite only modelling to help her friend and not wanting to act, she was unable to decline Karya's request for fear of being impolite to such a [...] "warm and friendly" [...] person. She later described Karya as having [...] "reeled [...] in, slowly, slowly, like a fisherma," [...] and considered leaving acting after wrapping up filming. Her work in Cinta Pertama garnered her a Citra Award for Best Actress, which convinced her to continue acting. Karya later told her that he had fought with his producer over her casting; the producer expressed concern that Hakim was [...] "too thin and had no chest," [...] to which Karya replied [...] "are <b>we</b> <b>selling</b> a film or are <b>we</b> <b>selling</b> breasts?" ...|$|R
