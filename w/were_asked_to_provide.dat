25|$|The Hamilton Project {{published}} a guidebook with 15 different proposals from various policy and budget experts in February, 2013. The authors <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> pragmatic, evidenced-based proposals that would both {{reduce the deficit}} and bring broader economic benefits. Proposals included a value added tax and reductions to tax expenditures, among others.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} requirements {{document was}} finalized in October, and sent {{out as a}} request for proposals (RFP) to 13 companies on 8 December 1965. Eight companies responded with proposals. Following a downselect, four companies <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> further developments. In total, they developed some 500 design concepts. Typical designs featured variable-sweep wings, weighed over , included {{a top speed of}} Mach 2.7 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.75. When the proposals were studied in July 1966, the aircraft were roughly the size and weight of the TFX, and like that aircraft, a design that could not be considered an air superiority fighter.|$|E
25|$|If a {{participant}} indicated a {{tip of the}} tongue state, they <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> any information about the target word they could recall. Brown and McNeill found that participants could identify the first letter of the target word, the number of syllables of the target word, words of similar sound, words of similar meaning, syllabic pattern, and the serial position of some letters in the target word better than would be expected by chance. Their findings demonstrated {{the legitimacy of the}} feeling of knowing experienced in a tip of the tongue state. This study was the foundation for subsequent research about tip of the tongue phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Forty-two {{bodies were}} found and transported to Montreal to be {{identified}}. 39 of those were identified by investigators by late August 2013 and the 40th in April 2014. Identification of additional victims became increasingly difficult after the August 1 end of the on-site search and family members <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> DNA samples of those missing, as well as dental records. The bodies of five presumed victims were never found. It {{is possible that some}} of the missing people were vaporized by the explosions. As two of the three local notary offices were destroyed by fire (and only one of the document vaults survived the blaze), the last will and testament of some victims of the disaster was lost.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 75 ethnic, {{social, and}} {{religious}} Chicago organizations <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> candidates whose faces would be photographed for {{integration into the}} fountain. The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition HDW-F900 video camera, the same model used {{in the production of}} the three Star Wars prequels. About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in public art for the project. Faculty from Columbia College Chicago was also involved in the production of the video. The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project. [...] Because the image proportions were like a movie screen with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was turned on its side during filming.|$|E
500|$|A {{year after}} Zhang {{presented}} his seismoscope to the court, officials and candidates <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> comments about {{a series of}} recent earthquakes which {{could be interpreted as}} signs of displeasure from Heaven. The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth. In Zhang's memorial discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters, he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title [...] "Filial and Incorrupt" [...] at age forty. The new system also transferred the power of the candidates' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household, who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen. Although Zhang's memorial was rejected, his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace Attendant, a position he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun. With this prestigious new position, Zhang earned a salary of 2,000bushels and had the right to escort the emperor.|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} rapid transit proposal came {{as part of}} the Forward Thrust initiatives of the late 1960s, which was centered around a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue. The subway would be fed by lines from Ballard, Lake City, the University District, Capitol Hill, Bellevue, and Renton, combining for a planned minimum headway of [...] minutes at rush hour, [...] minutes during midday, and five minutes at all other times. The stations on 3rd Avenue were to be situated at South Jackson Street and 5th Avenue South, James and Cherry streets, Seneca and Spring streets, and Pike and Pine streets, all planned to open by 1985 and operated by the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle. Seattle voters <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> $385 million (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars), to supplement a $765 million grant (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), during a municipal election on February 13, 1968, narrowly passing the bond by 50.8%, but falling short of the required 60 percent supermajority. A second attempt on May 19, 1970, with an adjusted $440 million local contribution (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) and $881 million federal grant (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars), failed to pass with only 46% approval amid a local recession caused by layoffs at Boeing; the earmarked funds intended for the Forward Thrust rapid transit project were instead allocated to Atlanta, to build its rapid transit system.|$|E
2500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Sheffield, England, as a schoolgirl in 1980 Sulley (aged 17) and her friend Joanne Catherall were [...] "discovered" [...] in the Crazy Daisy Nightclub in Sheffield by Philip Oakey, the lead singer and a {{founding}} member of The Human League. The pair were invited to join the new line-up, initially as dancers and incidental vocalists (and, as Oakey puts it, [...] "to provide some glamour") for a European tour. They soon <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> full vocals by Oakey as an experiment. The girls' distinctive vocals rapidly became a signature of the new Human League, changing the band's style, its appeal to the mainstream public, and to its subsequent commercial success.|$|E
2500|$|HMS Paz was {{registered}} on 4 June 1808. However, she {{was already}} commissioned in February 1807 under Lieutenant George Mitchenor. In April, Lieutenant John Pierie replaced Mitchenor, still on the River plate station. Pierie had been a pressed man, an unusual background for an officer. He quarreled with his sailing master and froze {{him out of the}} running of the vessel. During Pierie's command, 14 of his 31 crewmen deserted. This may not have been entirely due to Pierie. When captains of four other vessels on the station <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> crew to man Paz, they naturally sent over [...] "the clumsy, the stupid, the violent, and the disobedient", and these men represented over half of her crew.|$|E
