5|$|Work teams (also {{referred}} to as production and service teams) are continuing work units responsible for producing goods or providing services for the organization. Their membership is typically stable, usually full-time, and well-defined. These teams are traditionally directed by a supervisor who mandates what <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> who does it, and in what manner is it executed. Work teams are effectively used in manufacturing sectors such as mining and apparel and service based sectors such as accounting which utilize audit teams.|$|E

5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by {{hand from the}} beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E
5|$|Chief Vanuatu, {{leader of}} the bigfoots, in {{recognition}} of the pair's actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell that will make the world safe for bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell's four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max's help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur, and a vortex contained within a snow globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that their <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> Sam and Max take the frozen ice block containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has been returned to them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.|$|E

25|$|In {{the notable}} {{case of a}} force applied to a body always at an angle of 90° from the {{velocity}} vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force), no <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> at all, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{expansion}} {{discussed in this}} article, in which a gas or liquid at pressure P1 flows into a region of lower pressure P2 without significant change in kinetic energy, is called the Joule–Thomson expansion. The expansion is inherently irreversible. During this expansion, enthalpy remains unchanged (see proof below). Unlike a free expansion, <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> causing a change in internal energy. Whether the internal energy increases or decreases is determined by whether <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> on or by the fluid; that {{is determined by the}} initial and final states of the expansion and the properties of the fluid.|$|E

25|$|A {{positive}} cell potential gives {{a negative}} change in Gibbs free energy.
