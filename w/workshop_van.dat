Upon {{arrival in}} Sobibor {{he was among}} the skilled workers selected while the remainder of the deportees were gassed or shot. Van Dam was set up in an atelier for craftsmen where he created paintings for the camp staff. Sobibor survivor Kurt Ticho, who had befriended Van Dam in the camp, later recalled that deputy camp commander SS-Oberscharführer (Staff Sergeant) Gustav Wagner had ordered Van Dam to paint him based on the image on a postcard. Ticho testified during the Sobibor trial in Hagen that van Dam had painted portraits for the SS. An other survivor, Ursula Stern, mentioned in her post-war statements that Heinrich Himmler had posed for a portrait by Van Dam on an inspection tour of the extermination camp and its gassing operations. In the craftsmen’s <b>workshop</b> <b>Van</b> Dam worked alongside Li van Staden, Moshe Goldfarb and the surviving gold smith Stanislaw Szmajzner. During much of his time in the camp Van Dam had a privileged position. When approximately 70 Dutch men assigned to slave-labour in the camp were murdered, following a betrayed escape attempt, he was exempt from these reprisal killings. SS-Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel stated in 1983 that he had kept one of the paintings by Van Dam but that his family had destroyed it, and everything else that connected Frenzel with the camps, after his 1962 arrest. He further stated that Van Dam had been killed in the revolt and that the paintings in Sobibor’s staff quarters had been destroyed at the same time.|$|E

The second {{aim was to}} examine differences in intention to participate in running, how apps were used, and expected effects of app use between fast and slow runners {{six months after the}} run. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted to analyze differences between fast and slow runners on a recreational run. A random selection of 15, 000 runners (of 54, 000 participants) of a 4 and 10 EM recreational run (Dam tot Damloop) in the Netherlands was invited to participate in an online survey two days after the run. The following issues were addressed: age, sex, experience with running, time to complete distance, motives for running and importance of app functionalities. Based on their performance, the runners were divided into four groups; the fastest quartile and slowest quartile were determined for each sex. In addition, six months after the run the same participants were invited to participate in a follow-up online survey. Based on a theoretical model, participants were asked about their intention to engage in physical activity and how they used apps (Ajzen, 1991). Attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioral control were addressed. For males and females, the fastest and slowest group were compared by using Man-Whitney tests.

40|$|Wheat {{was one of}} thee first {{plants to}} be {{cultivated}} by mankind, and today {{it is a major}} dietary constituent of {{about a quarter of the}} world's population, according to the International Wheat Council. It also dominates world cereal trade, with global trade increasing from 35 million tonnes In the 1950 's to 100 million tonnes in the Eighties (1988 - 89, 97. 8 m). North American production accounts for 38 % of this total. More significantly, wheat has for some time been the greatest cause of a massive shift in food preference throughout the tropics, a shift which has posed an as yet unresolved dilemma for many tropical countries. Food-deficit nations in Africa and else where have made up for their shortages of locally grown grains by importing cereals, most notably wheat. As a result, the importance of wheat in the diets of many developing countries has grown substantially, and it now provides 27 % of their cereal calories and 3 % of protein requirements. Wheat flour is unique in that it contains high levels of gluten. When water is added to wheat flour, the gluten proteins bind with water to make the dough easily work able and a light, palatable loaf results. Flours from other cereals and tubers contain little or no gluten and tend to result in a much more dense loaf. As a result, many people, especially city-dwellers, now want bread made from wheat flour because it is not only more > than traditional staple crops such as cassava, millet or sorghum, it also has a certain > attached to it. Yet wheat cannot easily be grown in most tropical countries. The growing demand for wheat has become a major problem for many ACP countries. Wheat imports have been rising steadily to around 20 million tonnes annually representing 80 % of requirements. High population growth, rising incomes, income distribution, low prices and simple changes in food preference are all contributory factors and cereal imports into tropical countries are growing faster than the ability of some of the countries to pay. More than 12 million tonnes are imported annually into subSaharan Africa alone, costing in excess of $ 2. 5 billion. More than 20 % of all cereals eaten are imported and 25 % of export earnings are used up to pay for them. Wheat is already the most important staple crop in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, so what are the prospects for ACP countries? Can wheat be grown successfully in tropical climates, and is there any real need to expand production when the world already houses surplus stocks of 130 million tonnes? Ideal conditions Wheat is cultivated in a wide range of environments around the world but grows best in temperate zones where there is low to moderate rainfall. More land is devoted to growing wheat - about 230 million ha than to any other commercial crop and more wheat is produced than any other cereal. But 90 % of all wheat is grown in the northern hemisphere. Wheat production in the tropics contributes less than 2 % of the total global wheat harvest. In Africa, very little wheat is grown south of the Sahara. What little is produced is grown in rainfed systems in the East African highlands or as irrigated winter season crops in southern Africa. Rainfed wheat is produced only at altitude: Kenya, for example, grows all of its wheat on land above 2000 metres In west and central Africa, small amounts of wheat have been grown for centuries on small irrigated plots during the dry season in the Sudan and the Sahel. The potential for wheat is improving with the development of irrigation schemes, notably in Nigeria, Chad and Ghana, but local varieties are especially susceptible to stem rust, a major disease of wheat. Other problems are that they are weak-strawed and also unsuitable for baking. Yet, according to the FAO, 38 million ha in Africa are suitable for wheat production and many African countries are now looking to expand wheat production to try and reduce import bills. Somalia is interested in reducing its annual imports of 180, 000 tonnes of wheat flour but, at present, wheat is grown only by smallholders on 4000 ha in the remote northwest highlands. Sudan is attempting to expand wheat production or irrigated clay soils in a double cropping system with cotton. The Institute of Agricultural Research in Ethiopia has developed wheat varieties specifically suited for local conditions, but the supply of water from the Awash river and the availability of sufficient labour to hand-harvest the cotton crop, with which the wheat would be grown have proved restrictive. Nigeria has announced that its production target will be 800, 000 tonnes in 1989. Scientists have been striving for more than 40 years to produce better varieties of wheat and improved high-yield varieties (HYV), adapted to sub-tropical conditions, were developed in Mexico by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) has a global mandate to increase productivity in wheat and maize, its research resources being targeted towards improving techniques for resourcepoor farmers. The use of HYV seeds led to a marked improvement in wheat production throughout the world. Production in India doubled between 1966 and mid- 1972 and, virtually within a decade, India changed from being the world's second largest importer of cereals to being self-sufficient. By the 1970 s more than half the wheat fields in developing countries were using new varieties which could produce two to three times as much as traditional varieties. Initially, only wealthy farmers could benefit from using the seeds as they required fertiliser, good water supplies and protection from a wide range of pests and diseases. Led by CIMMYT and the FAO's Seed Improvement and Development Programme (SIDP), which covers more than 118 countries, research is now being directed toward producing new seeds that are not so reliant on expensive inputs. Work is also progressing toward developing seeds designed to grow well in tropical climates. Tropical wheat systems Several major constraints will need to be overcome if large-scale wheat fanning is to be introduced successfully in the tropics. In Europe and the Americas wheat is grown in sophisticated farming systems, often using the latest technology. However, in the tropics, it is grown mainly as a high-altitude crop - usually as part of a wheat/dairy farming system - and is not as suitable as other cereals, such as maize, for growing by small-holders, unless they are organised into cooperatives. Wheat-farming systems in the tropics face a variety of other problems. There is a tendency to burn off straw and stubble after harvesting, which makes ploughing easier and helps prevent the carry-over of disease. But this is counter-productive in areas where poor, light soils could be improved by ploughing in the straw to improve soil structure. In the tropics, soil erosion may also be a significant factor in curtailing wheat production. Soil loss is particularly damaging, as shown by the situation in the United States where the loss of two cms of topsoil reduced yields by 6 %. Unless new varieties of wheat are developed, the need for a high level of inputs will remain a major drawback. At present, nitrogen fertilizer requirements rise to 150 kg per ha for any sort of economic return on high-yield seeds. And phosphate must also be carefully considered as full response to nitrogen fertilizer is obtained only when phosphorus is not a limiting factor. Wheat is often grown in rotation with rice, but the two cereals have almost 200 insect pest in common. Also, the bacterium Xanthomanas campestris, which has a worldwide distribution, causes a serious disease of wheat and, to control it in tropical regions, seeds and irrigation water need to be carefully monitored. Stem, leaf and stripe rusts caused by Puccinia fungi are the most serious diseases of wheat. In epidemics, up to 75 % of the crop may be destroyed by pests; therefore, effective pest and disease control will require a community-wide crop management programme to avoid pest build-up and minimize losses. This will necessitate a great deal of coordination and expense. Towards improved production Fortunately, many wild strains of wheat contain genetic material from which plant breeders can introduce pest and disease resistance. Wild varieties also show drought resistance, salt and heat tolerance, winter hardiness and increased protein content. Consequently, if wheat is to be grown with any degree of economic success in the tropics, plant breeding and biotechnology will have a major role to play. Wheat yields are sensitive to high temperatures early in the growing season and to even slight deviations from optimal planting dates. Although high temperatures limit yield potential, it is moisture levels and soil acidity that are more critical. Consequently, in the tropics dramatic fluctuations in yields are common. However, field trials of wheat in tropical conditions have shown that yields of 5, 000 kg per ha can be achieved. At harvest, small-holders must cut their wheat manually with hand sickles when the seeds are hard and dry. Cutting semidwarf HYVs is a particularly exhausting task. There are severe storage problems to overcome: high temperatures and relative humidities are not conducive to efficient, low-cost storage methods, particularly as stored wheat grain should have a moisture content of less than 14 %. Additionally, wheat grain generally needs to be milled before use, which requires both equipment and a source of power. The milling process itself also has to be carried out fairly carefully, as all the thiamine (vitamin B 1) can be milled out of the grain leading to deficiency diseases such as Beri Beri Wheat is now being promoted as an additional crop in rotations where there would otherwise be no crop during the cool' dry season, such as in rainfed upland or rice paddies. During 1975 - 84, wheat production in developing countries increased at 5 % per year. higher yields mainly being from the use of HYV seeds. Although the total potential wheat area in the tropics is estimated to be around 3. 5 million ha spread through 60 countries, until 1982 no efforts had been made to expand research to over production in tropical climates. Today, several national wheat programmes have been established in ACP countries, including Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon' and Madagascar. Particular attention is being paid to the potential of Triticale, a hybrid cereal obtained by crossing wheat and rye, which can be grow on land that is marginal for wheat. Triticale is comparatively disease-resistant and adapted to acid soils. In rice-growing areas, it performs well when grown out of season on rice paddies. In addition, it shows better nutrient efficiency than wheat and is almost as rich in gluten, with the result that Triticale flour can be used for baking bread. Wheat improvement programmes have already identified varieties that show a tolerance to otherwise toxic levels of free aluminium the soil, and seeds which perform well in acidic soils. But relatively little effort has been made to use modern breeding techniques to adapt wheat plants to soils of poor nutritional status, such as those in much of the tropics. Furthermore, there is scant evidence to suggest that increased protein content in either wheat or Triticale can be combined with high-yield, (protein deficiency being an important factor in improving health in developing countries). In the past, wheat consumption has been an indicator of the degree of industrialisation and urbanisation of a country. Demand for leavened bread in the northern industrialized countries rose dramatically in the 19 th century, but has been on the decline ever since. Meanwhile, as counties in Asia, Africa and the Pacific continue to become more developed, the demand for bread is rising, especially in the cities. Several of these nations are resorting to a rar~ety of ploys to try and reduce the burden of wheat imports. A composite Flour Programme was begun by the FAO in 1965, which encouraged people to use flours and starches other than wheat in bakery products. As a result, in Senegal, two kinds of composite wheat flour were introduced. > uses wheat flour mixed with 30 % millet flour and 7 % peanut flour. > has 20 % cassava starch, enriched with soya or peanut flour. In Brazil, all wheat flour products must use at least 5 % cassava flour. Satisfying the demand for wheat in the tropics from domestic production will not be easy. Many nations which have regularly imported wheat have established processing facilities, but these have been sited close to the major coastal ports. Unfortunately, this will do little to ease the problems for countries wishing to set up their own wheat industry at any distance from these facilities. In Nigeria, for example, areas with potential for domestic wheat production are 1, 000 km from the port-based processing factory, the port also happening to be the largest city and consumer of wheat. Moreover, large-scale processing mills are not able to deal efficiently and economically with small amount of domeshcally-grown wheat. It seems likely that small rural processing facilities will have to be established if local wheat production is to be a success.
