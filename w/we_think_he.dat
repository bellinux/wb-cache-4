500|$|On October 23, 2008, Frazier {{verbally}} {{committed to}} the Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team. He said to Scout.com, [...] "I decided to be a Nittany Lion because I {{felt it was a}} great fit for me. Penn State has great academics as well as a great basketball team and that's what I was looking for." [...] Frazier also said that he had a [...] "great time" [...] on his official visit and all his relatives supported the decision. He received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008. After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He can get in the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score. He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really solidifies our backcourt for the future." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{he persuaded}} [...] John Cockcroft, {{a member of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, to suggest who might be invited to the 1958 conference. [...] He {{successfully}} resisted a subsequent attempt to take over the conferences, causing a Foreign Office official to write that [...] "the difficulty is to get Prof. Rotblat to pay any attention to what <b>we</b> <b>think...</b> <b>He</b> is no doubt jealous of his independence and scientific integrity", and that securing [...] "a new organizer for the British delegation seems to be the first need, but I do not know if there is any hope of this." [...] By the early 1960s the Ministry of Defence thought that the Pugwash Conferences were [...] "now a very respectable organization", and the Foreign Office stated that it had [...] "official blessing" [...] and that any breakthrough may well originate at such gatherings. The Pugwash Conferences are credited with laying the ground work for the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 and the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. In parallel with the Pugwash Conferences, he [...] joined with Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, Bertrand Russell and other concerned scientists to found the World Academy of Art and Science, which was proposed by them in the mid-1950s and formally constituted in 1960.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the case}} {{reaching}} the high court, Lewis tweeted that Avicii was fully aware of his song being sampled on [...] "Collide", [...] "With regards to my song, Avicii was aware & agreeing publishing splits {{for himself and his}} manager. When Avicii sent his track out to have a song written over it I totally fell in love with this version and I think he's super talented." [...] Syco also responded to the claim, stating that Avicii was always going to work with Lewis, and that he would be credited on the song. In response, Avicii accused Lewis and her label of lying about working together, and tweeted [...] "Thanks for accusing me of lying and speaking on my behalf. Since we never met or even spoke, please let me and my manager know who told you that and what confirmation they gave you." [...] Hours before both Lewis's and Avicii's record labels were supposed to appear in the high court, Syco released a statement that both record labels had reached an agreement and that Avicii would appear as a featured artist on [...] "Collide", whilst Lewis would appear as the lead artist. Avicii and his record label were pleased with the result, with the former saying [...] "Glad to FINALLY have resolved situation with Leona. Music is the answer... We've finally come to an agreement with Leona on all the issues... So happy to move on and focus on hit making... So happy to move on with Leona and focus on having a hit together." [...] The latter stated [...] "Avicii is an up-and-coming talent; <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> should be given a fair crack at making this record the hit it deserves to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Dewey (1859–1952) {{had a major}} {{influence}} on the development of progressive education in the United States. He believed that the classroom should prepare children to be good citizens and facilitate creative intelligence. He pushed for the creation of practical classes that could be applied outside of a school setting. He also thought that education should be student-oriented, not subject-oriented. For Dewey, education was a social experience that helped bring together generations of people. He stated that students learn by doing. He believed in an active mind that was able to be educated through observation, problem solving and enquiry. In his 1910 book How <b>We</b> <b>Think,</b> <b>he</b> emphasizes that material should be provided {{in a way that is}} stimulating and interesting to the student since it encourages original thought and problem solving. [...] He also stated that material should be relative to the student's own experience.|$|E
2500|$|On February 25, 2006, Vargas {{once again}} {{returned}} to the ring to face fellow Southern California boxer Sugar Shane Mosley. [...] In a tightly contested battle, Vargas' left eye became grotesquely swollen and referee Joe Cortez decided to stop the fight in the 10th round to minimize further damage, granting a technical knockout (TKO) victory to Mosley. The reasoning behind the stoppage, explained Nevada State Athletic Commission czar Marc Ratner, was that the referee and the fight doctor deemed that Vargas was unable to defend himself adequately against Mosley's right-hand shots. At {{the time of the}} stoppage, two judges had Mosley winning the fight 86-85. One judge had Vargas winning the fight 86-85. Fightnews.com had the bout scored 86-85 for Mosley. In the post fight press conference, Vargas {{made it clear that he}} would resume his boxing career and stated that a rematch with Mosley should be in order because the match was stopped on a technicality. ESPN boxing expert Dan Rafael wrote: [...] "Vargas is so utterly delusional about what actually happened in his first fight with Mosley that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might have a concussion. When will he stop lying to himself -- and when will his team stop going along with him? He needs to admit that: (a) The swelling around his eye was caused by a clean punch, not a headbutt; and (b) He was not winning the fight when it was stopped in the 10th round." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by M83's Anthony Gonzalez, who had supported the band on their Day & Age World Tour. Island Records subsequently suggested Gonzalez as a possible producer for the band, following the success of M83's sixth studio album, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming (2011). Guitarist Dave Keuning noted, [...] "There was a mutual thing like, 'Yeah <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> good. We'll try him out.' It's something we finally agreed with our label on." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{character}} of Burt {{has been extremely}} well received by critics.

5000|$|Marson {{participated in}} the major league 2009 spring {{training}} with the Phillies, where veteran starter Jamie Moyer expressed his pleasure with Marson's skills and ability to call the game. Assistant GM Chuck LaMar said that [...] " [...] strength has actually become his ability to run the game… That is unique for a converted catcher. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{one of the finest}} catching prospects in baseball." [...] Marson was reassigned to the minor leagues on March 23, but was called up to the majors on April 11 to replace Carlos Ruiz, who injured his right oblique muscle.

5000|$|Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) is Kurt's {{father and}} Finn's {{stepfather}} to whom Kurt {{comes out in}} the episode [...] "Preggers". Both James Poniewozik for Time and Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly praised O'Malley's performance in the storyline, with Poniewozik additionally commenting: [...] "the fact that Dad ... ends up not being the boor <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> going to be {{is one of the}} first signs that Glee is growing up as a series, that having established a world of primary-color stereotypes, it's now willing to subvert those expectations."

[...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized Rachel's actions in the episode, and felt that: [...] "Rachel has become insufferable. The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bona fide triple-threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna to the rest of Glee." ...|$|R
