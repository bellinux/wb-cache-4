40|$|Abstract Background The genus Flavivirus {{encompasses}} {{more than}} 50 distinct species of arthropod-borne viruses, including several major human pathogens, such as West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus {{and the four}} serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV type 1 - 4). Each year, flaviviruses cause more than 100 million infections worldwide, some of <b>which</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>life-threatening</b> conditions such as encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever. Among the viral proteins, NS 3 and NS 5 proteins constitute the major enzymatic components of the viral replication complex and {{are essential to the}} flavivirus life cycle. Results We report here the results of a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the interactions between human host proteins and the flavivirus NS 3 and NS 5 proteins. Using our screen results and literature curation, we performed a global analysis of the NS 3 and NS 5 cellular targets based on functional annotation with the Gene Ontology features. We finally created the first flavivirus NS 3 and NS 5 proteins interaction network and analysed the topological features of this network. Our proteome mapping screen identified 108 human proteins interacting with NS 3 or NS 5 proteins or both. The global analysis of the cellular targets revealed the enrichment of host proteins involved in RNA binding, transcription regulation, vesicular transport or innate immune response regulation. Conclusions We proposed that the selective disruption of these newly identified host/virus interactions could represent a novel and attractive therapeutic strategy in treating flavivirus infections. Our virus-host interaction map provides a basis to unravel fundamental processes about flavivirus subversion of the host replication machinery and/or immune defence strategy. </p...|$|E

In the discovery GWAS, we identified 243 autosomal variants which clustered in 14 loci (p≤ 10 − 5). The best association signal (rs 117983287; p= 8. 16 × 10 − 8) was observed for a missense variant located at chromosome 9 q 21. 2 in the VPS 13 A gene. VPS 13 A was further supported by additional GWAS (p= 0. 03) and sequencing data (p= 0. 04).

30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{hypoglycemia}} is induced by various reasons such as the overuse of anti-diabetic drugs and/or insulin, various diseases including insulinoma, insulin autoimmune syndrome and adrenal insufficiency. Hypoglycemia influences quality of life and increases the risk of cardiovascular events (Frier et al. 2011; Barendse et al. 2012). When subjects suffer from hypoglycemia, they usually notice it with warning symptoms such as cold sweating and/or palpitation, but recurrent hypoglycemia can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the impairment of counter-regulatory hormone response and awareness of hypoglycemia <b>which</b> sometimes <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>life-threatening</b> hypoglycemic coma (Widom and Simonson 1992; Kinsley et al. 1995; Lingenfelser et al. 1995; Kaneto et al. 1998).

He had experienced repeated pancreatitis since he was 18 years old, and the attack frequency in the previous 2 years had increased from once per 3 months to once per 1. 5 months. He had received diet modification, medication, and even apheresis, but the effects were not satisfactory. He finally underwent laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass surgery as a mode of metabolic surgery on August 1, 2011. His triglyceride level decreased rapidly after the surgery.

However, {{a clear picture of}} the clinical course of CGD is hampered by its low prevalence (approximately 1 : 250, 000). Therefore, extensive clinical data from 429 European patients were collected and analyzed. Of these patients 351 were males and 78 were females. X-linked (XL) CGD (gp 91 (phox) deficient) accounted for 67 % of the cases, autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance for 33 %. AR-CGD was diagnosed later in life, and the mean survival time was significantly better in AR patients (49. 6 years) than in XL CGD (37. 8 years), suggesting a milder disease course in AR patients. The disease manifested itself most frequently in the lungs (66 % of patients), skin (53 %), lymph nodes (50 %), gastrointestinal tract (48 %) and liver (32 %). The most frequently cultured micro-organisms per episode were Staphylococcus aureus (30 %), Aspergillus spp. (26 %), and Salmonella spp. (16 %). Surprisingly, Pseudomonas spp. (2 %) and Burkholderia cepacia (< 1 %) were found only sporadically. Lesions induced by inoculation with BCG occurred in 8 % of the patients. Only 71 % of the patients received antibiotic maintenance therapy, and 53 % antifungal prophylaxis. 33 % were treated with gamma-interferon. 24 patients (6 %) had received a stem cell transplantation. The most prominent reason of death was pneumonia and pulmonary abscess (18 / 84 cases), septicemia (16 / 84) and brain abscess (4 / 84).

40|$|Clozapine is an {{antipsychotic}} drug {{which is used}} in the treatment of therapy-resistant schizophrenia. The most frequently reported side effects (occurring in more than 10 % of patients) are gastro-intestinal complaints, including constipation. Here we describe the case of a 28 -year-old man with schizophrenia who developed constipation and abdominal distension for several weeks while taking clozapine. He was admitted as an emergency suffering from clozapine-induced Ogilvie syndrome (acute pseudo-obstruction caused by a disturbed balance in the autonomic regulation of intestinal motility). Treatment on the intensive care unit was required because of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Colonoscopy showed severe ischaemic colitis without signs of perforation or obstruction. Because conservative treatment with enemas, prokinetic drugs and antibiotics did not have sufficient effect, the cholinergic drug neostigmine was added to the treatment regimen.

Hemorrhage and plasma leakage are two major hallmarks of DHF/DSS. Because the mechanisms causing these pathogenic changes are unclear, there is no effective therapy against DHF/DSS. In this review, we focus on the possible pathogenic effects of a pleiotropic cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), on the pathogenesis of DENV infection. MIF is a critical mediator of the host immune response and inflammation, and there is a correlation between the serum levels of MIF and disease severity in dengue patients. Furthermore, MIF knock-out mice exhibit less severe clinical disease and lethality. However, the role of MIF in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not limited to immune cell recruitment. Recent evidence indicates that DENV infection induced MIF production and may contribute to vascular hyperpermeability and viral replication during DENV infection. The expression of both adhesion and coagulation molecules on MIF-stimulated monocytes and endothelial cells is also increased, which may contribute to inflammatory and anticoagulatory states during DHF/DSS. Therefore, blocking MIF production or its function may provide a solution for the treatment and prevention of DHF/DSS...|$|R

After 9 months of feeding with this diet, the rabbits showed high total cholesterol levels in serum and liver tissues in the absence of insulin resistance. The livers became whitish and nodular. In addition, the number of rabbit macrophage antigen-positive cells and the expression of mRNAs for inflammatory cytokines showed a significant increase. Moreover, fibrotic septa composed of collagens and α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells were found between the central and portal veins, indicating alteration of the parenchymal architecture. There was also a marked increase of mRNAs for transforming growth factor-β 1 and collagen 1 A 1. Comprehensive analysis of protein and gene expression revealed an imbalance of the antioxidant system and methionine metabolism. We also found that ezetimibe attenuated steatohepatitis in this model.

Investigating the adhesion to the main muscle fibrous ECM proteins, insoluble fibronectin, collagen I, III and IV, laminin-a 2 and elastin, results demonstrated that the preceding growth conditions had a great influence on subsequent bacterial attachment.

40|$|Introduction: Huge {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) possesses a potential risk for spontaneous rupture, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a <b>life-threatening</b> complication {{with a high}} mortality rate. In addition, a large HCC is frequently accompanied by intrahepatic metastases. Presentation of case: We describe, {{the case of a}} 74 -year-old woman with a huge extrahepatically expanding HCC with multiple intrahepatic metastases who was treated by liver resection with repeated transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). To prevent tumor rupture or bleeding, we performed right hepatectomy. After the operation, TACE was applied for multiple intrahepatic metastases in the remnant liver. Furthermore, the elevated protein induced vitamin K absence (PIVKA II) level had decreased to limits within the normal range. Three months after the first TACE, computed tomography revealed several recurrences in the liver. TACE was applied for the second and third time and the tumors were well controlled. Discussion: Although, liver resection is occasionally performed for patients with huge HCC to avoid spontaneous tumor rupture, only surgical approach might not be sufficient for such advanced HCC. To achieve long-term survival, it is necessary to control the residual intrahepatic tumors. We could control multiple intrahepatic metastases with repeated TACEs after hepatectomy. Conclusion: Multimodal treatment involving hepatectomy and TACE might be a good treatment strategy for patients with huge HCC with multiple intrahepatic metastases if the tumors are localized in the liver without distant or peritoneal metastasis...|$|R
40|$|In {{sickle cell}} disease, sickle {{erythrocyte}} (SSRBC) interacts with endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets, and activates coagulation and inflammation, promoting vessel obstruction, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> serious <b>life-threatening</b> complications, including acute painful crises and irreversible damage to multiple organs. The mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK 1 / 2, is abnormally activated in SSRBCs. However, the therapeutic potential of SSRBC ERK 1 / 2 inactivation {{has never been}} investigated. I tested four different inhibitors of MEK 1 / 2 (MEK), the kinase that activates ERK 1 / 2, in a model of human SSRBC adhesion to TNFa-activated endothelial cells (ECs). SSRBC MEK inhibition abrogated adhesion to non-activated and TNFa-activated ECs to levels below baseline SSRBC adhesion to non-activated ECs in vitro. SSRBC MEK inhibition also prevented SSRBCs from activating naı̈ve neutrophils to adhere to endothelium. To {{determine the effect of}} MEK inhibitors on SSRBC adherence in vivo, sham-treated or MEK inhibitor-treated SSRBCs were infused to nude mice previously treated with TNFa. Sham-treated SSRBCs displayed marked adhesion and occlusion of enflamed vessels, both small and large. However, SSRBC treatment with MEK inhibitors ex vivo showed poor SSRBC adhesion to enflamed vessels with no visible vasoocclusion in vivo. In addition, MEK inhibitor treatment of SSRBCs reduced SSRBC organ trapping and increased the number of SSRBCs circulating in bloodstream. Thus, these data suggest that SSRBC ERK 1 / 2 plays potentially a critical role in sickl...|$|R
40|$|Vascular leakage is {{a serious}} side effect of therapies based on {{monoclonal}} antibodies or cytokines <b>which</b> may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>life-threatening</b> situations. With the steady increase of new drug development programs for large molecules, there is an urgent need for reliable tools to assess this potential liability of new medicines in a rapid and cost-effective manner. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) {{as a model for}} endothelium, we established an impedance-based assay measuring the integrity of the endothelial cell monolayer in real time. We could demonstrate that the HUVEC monolayer in our system was a relevant model as cells expressed major junctional proteins known to be responsible for maintaining tightness as well as receptors targeted by molecules known to induce vascular leakage in vivo. We assessed the time-dependent loss of barrier function using impedance and confirmed that signals obtained corresponded well to those from standard transwell assays. We assayed a series of reference molecules which led to the expected change of barrier integrity. A nonspecific cytotoxic effect could be excluded by using human fibroblasts as a nonresponder cell line. Finally, we could show reversibility of vascular permeability induced by histamine, IL- 1 β, or TNF-α by coincubation with established antagonists, further demonstrating relevance of this new model. Taken together, our results suggest that impedance in combination with HUVECs as a specific model can be applied to assess clinically relevant vascular leakage on an in vitro leve...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} and activity of different channel types mark and regulate specific stages of cancer establishment and progression. Blocking channel activity impairs {{the growth of}} some tumors, both in vitro and in vivo, which opens a new field for pharmaceutical research. However, ion channel blockers may produce serious side effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias. For instance, Kv 11. 1 (hERG 1) channels are aberrantly expressed in several human cancers, in which they control {{different aspects of the}} neoplastic cell behaviour. hERG 1 blockers tend to inhibit cancer growth. However they also retard the cardiac repolarization, thus lengthening the electrocardiographic QT interval, <b>which</b> can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular arrhythmias. Several possibilities exist to produce less harmful compounds, such as developing specific drugs that bind hERG 1 channels in the open state or disassemble the ion channel/integrin complex which appears to be crucial in certain stages of neoplastic progression. The potential approaches to improve the efficacy and safety of ion channel targeting in oncology include: (1) targeting specific conformational channel states; (2) finding ever more specific inhibitors, including peptide toxins, for channel subtypes mainly expressed in well-identified tumors; (3) using specific ligands to convey traceable or cytotoxic compounds; (4) developing channel blocking antibodies; (5) designing new molecular tools to decrease channel expression in selected cancer types. Similar concepts apply to ion transporters such as the Na+/K+ pump and the Na+/H+ exchanger. Pharmacological targeting of these transporters is also currently being considered in anti-neoplastic therapy...|$|R
40|$|Thoracic aortic {{aneurysm}} (TAA) is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving subclinical and progressive dilation of the thoracic aorta, <b>which</b> can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>life-threatening</b> complications such as dissection or rupture. Genetic testing {{is important for}} risk stratification and identification of at risk family members, and clinically available genetic testing panels have been expanding rapidly. However, when past testing results are normal, {{there is little evidence}} to guide decision-making about the indications and timing to pursue additional clinical genetic testing. Results from research based genetic testing can help inform this process. Here we present 10 TAA patients who {{have a family history of}} disease and who enrolled in research-based exome testing. Nine of these ten patients had previous clinical genetic testing that did not identify the cause of disease. We sought to determine the number of rare variants in 23 known TAA associated genes identified by research-based exome testing. In total, we found 10 rare variants in six patients. Likely pathogenic variants included a TGFB 2 variant in one patient and a SMAD 3 variant in another. These variants have been reported previously in individuals with similar phenotypes. Variants of uncertain significance of particular interest included novel variants in MYLK and MFAP 5, which were identified in a third patient. In total, clinically reportable rare variants were found in 6 / 10 (60 %) patients, with at least 2 / 10 (20 %) patients having likely pathogenic variants identified. These data indicate that consideration of re-testing is important in TAA patients with previous negative or inconclusive results...|$|R
