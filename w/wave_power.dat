5|$|As Hurricane Felix was looping {{offshore}} {{the eastern}} United States, it produced swells of 26ft (8m) along the Nova Scotia coast on an otherwise sunny day. Beaches were closed. Buoys near the Newfoundland coast recorded wave heights of 49ft (15m), while buoys farther offshore reported wave heights of 82ft (27.5m). The outer rainbands {{of the storm}} dropped light rainfall, peaking at around 3.43mm (87mm) in northern Newfoundland. Offshore Caithness in Scotland, waves from the remnants of Felix submerged an experimental <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> station, damaging it further after previous waves damaged the system.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to an existing installed capacity of 1.3 Gigawatts (GW) of hydro-electric schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of wind and 7.5 GW of tidal power, 25% of the estimated total capacity for the European Union and up to 14 GW of <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> potential, 10% of EU capacity. The renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, considerably greater than the existing capacity from all Scottish fuel sources of 10.3 GW. Scotland exceeded its renewable energy target, set in 2007, for 31% of total power generation coming from renewables by 2011. Scotland eyes 50% renewable energy by 2030.|$|E

5|$|The {{renewable}} energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, {{according to a}} 2013 study by Scottish Renewables. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support for {{renewable energy}}. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands.

5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

40|$|An {{expression}} is derived {{that describes the}} coherent Cerenkov radiated power {{from a group of}} test particles in a plasma medium moving parallel to a magnetic field. In this analysis, each particle has an arbitrary position and velocity along a field line and, as a consequence, both the spatial and temporal coherence of the radiation are considered. As an example, it is demonstrated that a monoenergetic electron beam consisting of small pulses can generate <b>wave</b> <b>powers</b> well above incoherent levels if the pulse spacing is comparable to an integer number of emission wavelengths. It is also shown that, if the beam particles have a velocity spread, Delta-V, the <b>wave</b> <b>powers</b> will decrease in time due to the reduced temporal coherence of the particle radiators, where this coherence scales as 1 /Delta-V. This latter effect applies to any charged particle beam propagating in a magnetoplasma, because even an initially monoenergetic beam becomes thermalized by electrostatic wave-particle interactions reducing the radiated power...|$|R

40|$|During the Spacelab 2 mission {{the plasma}} {{diagnostics}} package (PDP) {{was released from}} the Shuttle to free fly. At times during this free flight, when the PDP was magnetically connected to the Shuttle, Stanford's fast-pulsed electron generator, located in the Shuttle cargo bay, ejected a 1 -keV 50 -mA electron beam. The PDP plasma-wave instrument detected intense whistler-mode radiation during these beam ejections. This paper presents a study of a whistler mode emission detected during one particular continuous electron beam firing. Calculations indicate that the beam radiated approximately 1. 6 mW in the whistler mode as the beam traversed the 200 m from the Shuttle to the PDP. The emissivity also decreased by about a factor of 10 over this same distance. The measured <b>wave</b> <b>powers</b> are 10 to the 7 th greater than <b>wave</b> <b>powers</b> expected from incoherent Cerenkov radiation, verifying that the radiation is generated by a coherent process. Estimates of the emissivity based on measured electric field intensities in the beam indicate that the whistler-mode noise is produced by radiation from electron bunches created by an electrostatic beam-plasma instability...|$|R

40|$|Cordycepin (3 ′-deoxyadenosine) is a {{naturally}} occurring adenosine analogue {{and one of}} the bioactive constituents isolated from Cordyceps militaris/Cordyceps sinensis, species of the fungal genus Cordyceps. It has traditionally been a prized Chinese folk medicine for the human well-being. Because of similarity of chemical structure of adenosine, cordycepin has been focused on the diverse effects of the central nervous systems (CNSs), like sleep regulation. Therefore, this study was undertaken to know whether cordycepin increases the natural sleep in rats, and its effect is mediated by adenosine receptors (ARs). Sleep was recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG) for 4 hours after oral administration of cordycepin in rats. Sleep architecture and EEG power spectra were analyzed. Cordycepin reduced sleep-wake cycles and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Interestingly, cordycepin increased θ (theta) <b>waves</b> <b>power</b> density during NREM sleep. In addition, the protein levels of AR subtypes (A 1, A 2 A, and A 2 B) were increased after the administration of cordycepin, especially in the rat hypothalamus which {{plays an important role in}} sleep regulation. Therefore, we suggest that cordycepin increases theta <b>waves</b> <b>power</b> density during NREM sleep via nonspecific AR in rats. In addition, this experiment can provide basic evidence that cordycepin may be helpful for sleep-disturbed subjects...|$|R
