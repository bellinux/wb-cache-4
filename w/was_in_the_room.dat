25|$|On March 18, 2017, an {{electrical}} fault {{occurred in a}} Unit 3 switchgear room, resulting {{in the loss of}} a safety related electrical bus and a reactor trip. Other safety systems functioned as required, ensuring adequate reactor cooling. There was no threat to local residents or the environment, and the alert, the second-lowest Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) emergency declaration, was terminated later that same day. The electrical fault caused an arc flash, resulting in a minor burn of a plant worker who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and was treated at a local hospital. On March 22, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that it had initiated a special inspection into the failure of the electrical bus that resulted in the plant declaring an alert.|$|E
25|$|As a baby, Harry <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> when Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul {{had been}} {{weakened}} and destabilised by his continuous murders {{and the creation}} of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead {{is a direct result of}} this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.|$|E

[...] Slaton also said that Phagan's head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on the lathe, the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan's nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.|$|E

2500|$|The American {{reaction}} {{was that they}} would not apply any undue pressure on Israel to quit Lebanon as the Israeli presence in Lebanon may prove to be a catalyst for the disparate groups of Lebanon to make common cause against both Syrian and Israeli forces. Haig's analysis, which Ronald Reagan agreed with, was that this uniting of Lebanese groups would allow President Elias Sarkis to reform the Lebanese central Government and give the Palestinian refugees Lebanese citizenship. Additional evidence that the United States approved the Israeli invasion comes from longtime CIA analyst Charles Cogan, who says that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> during a May 1982 meeting in The Pentagon during which Sharon explained to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger [...] "in great detail how the Israelis were going to invade Lebanon...

2500|$|While {{serving as}} Assembly Speaker, Brown was {{diagnosed}} with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that still has no cure and that would slowly steal his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown's two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, [...] "Having RP is a challenge, as Speaker of the Assembly {{it was very important}} that I recognize people in the halls of the Legislature. But I couldn't see people unless they were right in front of me. I needed to have the security people give me notes to tell me who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means having to use more of your brain function—I listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands." [...] Brown has worked with the Foundation Fighting Blindness to raise awareness of the disease.|$|E

2500|$|In 1652, Matei and Princess Elena Năsturel {{had lost}} their adoptive son, Mateiaș. This fueled a search for another heir: Mihai, son of Nicolae Pătrașcu, and Istratie Golescu were considered, but Matei finally {{selected}} Buicescul—although the latter was by then middle-aged. Other boyars were disappointed with Matei's choice, believing Buicescul to be of flippant and haughty character; they sympathized more with the Serdar Constantin Șerban, {{born out of wedlock}} to the former Prince of 1602–1611, Radu Șerban. Buicescul himself had a noted rivalry with the Serdar, particularly after being revealed as an heir apparent. One detailed account, originating with Paul of Aleppo, suggests that Șerban refused to honor the Prince's choice, and never removed his hat if Buicescul <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Their clashes aggravated with time, prompting Prince Matei to arrest Șerban—allegedly, after Buicescul threatened resignation. Buicescul's rival was mutilated, or [...] "carved at the nose", which would have technically invalidated him from ever placing a claim to the throne. Historians disagree on whether this [...] "marking" [...] happened during Șerban's early years or was a consequence of his arrest by Prince Matei.|$|E

To Yusupov's surprise, Rasputin {{did not appear to}} be {{affected}} by the poison. Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. [...] Taking a revolver from Dmitry Pavlovich, Yusupov returned to the basement and, referring to a crucifix that <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> told Rasputin that he'd [...] "better look at the crucifix and say a prayer," [...] then shot him once in the chest. [...] Believing him to be dead, they then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat, in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night. [...] Upon returning to the Moika Palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead. Suddenly, Rasputin leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who - with some effort - freed himself and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed, and made it into the palace's courtyard before being shot by Purishkevich and collapsing into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped Rasputin's body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge and dropped it into the Malaya Nevka River.|$|E

Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it.
