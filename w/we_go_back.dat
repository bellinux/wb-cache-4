500|$|After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had {{difficulty}} {{finding a new}} subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced {{that it would be}} expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, [...] "Will <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to it? [...] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A." [...] Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Say Yes" [...] was filmed on May 20, 2014 and {{directed}} by Matthew A. Cherry. The clip was filmed {{in a house in}} Maplewood, New Jersey, where a crowd gathered the watch the trio on set. Following that, filming was cordoned by local police. Several pictures of Beyoncé arriving on set were shared on social networks by fans. Williams debuted the clip for [...] "Say Yes" [...] on her appearance at Good Morning America on June 18, 2014. Regarding the filming of the video, she stated, [...] "Sometimes the director or production assistants had to say like, 'OK, girls, bring it back home. Bring it back together because when we were together, <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to how we were when we were younger, just always laughing and talking about things. It's been a great moment." [...] The video was released on Williams' Vevo account the same day. A behind-the-scenes footage was also released featuring the trio on set and talking about the song and their reunion. In the clip, Williams said she felt excited that she had her [...] "sisters" [...] with her spreading a positive message for the world.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: [...] "We're not allowed {{to say anything about}} anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [...] has Tom Cruise seen this?!" ...|$|E

500|$|Lee later lamented: [...] "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, {{sitting in}} this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian. This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... {{emotions}} are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will {{have the kind of}} warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia." [...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why should <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E
2500|$|On February 28, 2008 McCain told ABC News' Bret Hovell, [...] "It's indisputable that (autism) is on {{the rise}} amongst children, the {{question}} is what's causing it.

2500|$|Meath's captain Nigel Crawford {{gave his}} {{opinion on the}} incident: [...] "I'm sure most players have been {{involved}} in controversial situations like that where you get calls for replays and things like that happening, but I just don't think it's possible or I just don't think it can happen. If you start that, where do you end up? Do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and say the ball wasn’t on the ground when we touched it and they got a free or whatever? It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right {{at the end of a}} game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation".|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, {{the private}} French COMETA report (written {{primarily}} by military defense analysts) stated the conclusion regarding UFO phenomena, that a [...] "single hypothesis sufficiently {{takes into account}} the facts and, for the most part, only calls for present-day science. It is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors." [...] The report noted issues with formulating the extraterrestrial hypothesis, likening its study to the study of meteorites, but concluded that although it was far from the best scientific hypothesis, [...] "strong presumptions exist in its favour". The report also concludes that the studies it presents [...] "demonstrate the almost certain physical reality of completely unknown flying objects with remarkable flight performances and noiselessness, apparently operated by intelligent [...] … Secret craft definitely of early origins (drones, stealth aircraft, etc.) can only explain a minority of cases. If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> far enough in time, we clearly perceive the limits of this explanation." ...|$|E

The fight {{took place at the}} Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield. Khan was able to control some of the fight and managed to survive a fourth-round knockdown from Diaz. Khan managed to hold on throughout the fight to go onto win the fight by a fairly close unanimous decision. The scorecards; Phil Edwards 114–113 – Steve Gray 115–113 – Terry O'Connor 115–112. In the aftermath, Khan praised Díaz, He caught me while I was off balance, and I couldn't get my stance back. I went down. I kept moving to recompose myself. That's what happens. There are little things to work on when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in the gym." [...] Khan stated the fight could be his last in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone following the first reunion show Only {{was asked about the}} future of the Misfits, and if there were plans to continue and possibly record new music. [...] "I want it to continue. I know Doyle wants it to continue. I know Glenn wants it to continue. We just have to be big-enough people to make it continue. And that's where we're at. Whatever it takes. We're going into our 40th anniversary so the timing couldn't be more perfect. Eventually Doyle's got to write a new album; I've got to write a new album; Glenn's got to write a new album. Why don't we work together and make the greatest album ever? Now we've got different elements. We've got Doyle playing more of a metal kind of thing. We've got Dave, who we're trying to figure out what the fuck he's doing. And Glenn's got his own thing. And Acey [...] fills in good, too. And I've got the band where it is today. So it's a matter of re-molding and using all the different elements that I've got." [...] When asked if Danzig would want to record new music Only said, [...] "I think it's got to evolve naturally. The thing is we've tried to plan things, and then we stand there and wait, and as it comes we'll just do it. When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> — I don't know about Glenn — but I canceled our touring and everything for this, so I'm going to go home and write and lift." ...|$|E
