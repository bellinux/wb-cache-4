[...] Angelica McDaniel on Williams' casting (2012) [...] In August 2012, with the installation of new executive producer Jill Farren Phelps and head writer Josh Griffith, The Young and the Restless released a casting call for the contract role of [...] "Tyler Douglas". A casting call released for the role of Lily led to speculation that the producers were recasting the role of Lily's brother, Devon Hamilton, portrayed by Bryton James. However, Phelps later confirmed that Tyler was a new character. Williams' audition tape would later surface revealing some very crucial information about the character. Initially, Tyler [...] "Douglas" [...] was to be introduced as the nephew of Sarge Wilder (Darnell Williams) and interacts with Lily when he starts working at Jabot Cosmetics. Later, Griffith stated that the character's familial relationship to Sarge was subject to change. After much speculation, Soap Opera Digest later revealed that the character would be the younger brother of Leslie Michaelson. In October, it was confirmed that Williams had been cast in the role; he taped his first scenes during the week of November 5, and was scheduled to begin airing on December 12. According to legendary casting director Judy Blye Wilson, despite Williams being very well known as a model, he was not on the soap opera's radar. Williams' manager heard about the casting call and had the actor upload his audition tape to his personal YouTube channel so Wilson could see it. Williams later revealed that after sending in his audition tape, he was contacted by the series to screen test with Khalil and Goddard. Williams made his first onscreen appearance on December 17, 2012. After a short time on a recurring status, Williams was placed on contract. He stated that he had [...] "mixed emotions" [...] of signing a contract, saying that he was [...] "a little concerned" [...] about being [...] "locked in for years", but added: [...] "On the other hand, knowing how this industry is, it felt good to have job security." [...] Williams was taken off contract in 2014, and was last seen on September 30.|$|E

One day last September when I was out shooting, she drove in a little pony cart we had, with the nurse, and the child but no man, to call on Mrs. Scroope who also had been recently confined.

30|$|In the {{newspaper}} Tidningen Härjedalen on 19 August 2010, the traditional farmer Karl-Olov Sundeberg {{was quoted as}} saying that 'we like music a lot and so a while ago Ingegerd [Karl-Olov's wife] and I were to go listen to Tomas Ledin [famous Swedish musician] when he played in Rätan, but then the cows did not come home from the forest so we couldn't make it. But all of that is forgotten the next day because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> with the life we lead' [author's translation and notes]. The milk cows are {{at the core of the}} business and the care and affection shown to farm animals was striking in encounters with traditional farmers in the present field studies. Free-range forest pasturing is based on being able to control animal behaviour, as the cows are expected to return home every night by themselves, so a lot of time is invested in creating emotional bonds with the cows. This is not regarded as something specific for this type of farming by the farmers themselves, as it is usually based on tacit knowledge and regarded simply as a necessity that comes with this line of work. Giving the animals the time and patience needed to establish necessary bonds of trust is crucial to these pasture regimes.|$|E
