Some studies have also shown that contrary to common belief complexity measures are not always better predictors than simple size metrics. All of these studies share one characteristic – they measure size, complexity and number of faults at the granularity of at least modules. In this work we compare the relative ability to predict the number of faults and fault-proneness of simple size metrics, such as Lines of Code (LOC), and complexity metrics. The caveat of our empirical investigation is that <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> <b>evidences</b> to compare the metrics on a level of granularity smaller than modules; we do it for segments of code that implement a particular software testing requirement.

We use the distinctive features of social welfare for identification. Methods: We consider a sample of disadvantaged males from The Netherlands who are observed between ages 18 and 32 on a monthly time scale. We simultaneously model the offending, employment and social welfare variables using a dynamic discrete choice model, where we allow for state dependence, reciprocal effects and time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. Results: We find significant negative bi-directional structural effects between employment and property crime. Robustness checks show that only regular employment is able to significantly reduce the offending probability. Further, a significant uni-directional effect is found for the public assistance category of social welfare on property offending. Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of economic incentives for explaining the relationship between employment and crime for disadvantaged individuals. For these individuals the crime reducing effects from the public assistance category of social welfare are statistically equivalent to those from employment, which suggests the importance of financial gains.

We find 21 NEAs whose orbital fits show a measurable orbital drift with a {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) greater than 3. The best determination is for asteroid (101955) 1999 RQ 36, resulting in the recovery of one radar apparition and an orbit improvement by two orders of magnitude.

In some cases it is possible to constrain physical quantities otherwise unknown by means of the detected orbital drift. Furthermore, the distribution of the detected orbital drifts shows an excess of retrograde rotators that can be connected to the delivery mechanism from the most important NEA feeding resonances and allows us to infer the distribution for NEAs obliquity.

Remarkably, a major role of this gene is regulation of the same hypoxia response pathway on which selection has most strikingly been observed in both Tibetan and Andean populations. Because it is also an important player in the circadian rhythm pathway, BHLHE 41 might also provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the recognized impacts of hypoxia on the circadian clock. These results support the view that Ethiopian, Andean, and Tibetan populations living at high altitude have adapted to hypoxia differently, with convergent evolution affecting different genes from the same pathway...|$|E
