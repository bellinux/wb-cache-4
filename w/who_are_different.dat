25|$|Learners {{learn about}} their identities {{and how they are}} {{situated}} within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people’s views about those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different,</b> and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others.|$|E
25|$|At a young age, {{children}} can already utilize {{their knowledge of}} different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people’s behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An {{example of this is}} the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys. Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience. The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.|$|E

[...] "The way we behave, to treat one another the way we're treating one another, to maintain this level of intolerance and discriminatory prejudice... hateful behavior towards other human beings <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> than you are," [...] Madonna concluded.|$|E
500|$|The social {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem {{wrote in}} Psychological Review that Bell et al. {{provide the most}} important data concerning [...] "experience-based theories" [...] {{of the development of}} sexual orientation, including [...] "the classical psychoanalytic account", as well as views that attribute the origins of sexual orientation to learning, conditioning, seduction, or labeling. According to Bem, their finding that [...] "no family variables" [...] are [...] "strongly implicated in the development of sexual orientation for either men or women" [...] is [...] "consistent with accumulating evidence that family variables account for much less of the environmental variance in personality than previously thought". Bem proposed a hypothesis that he refers to as [...] "Exotic becomes erotic": children feel different from either their same-sex peers or opposite-sex peers and therefore eroticize them, leading to homosexuality and heterosexuality respectively. Bem referred to Bell et al.′s finding that gay men and lesbians {{were significantly more likely to}} recall having felt different from same-sex children during the grade-school years, and to other studies that drew similar conclusions. Bem maintained that Bell′s view that people become erotically attracted to those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from them out of a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] does not accurately characterize or explain the data, and rejected Bell et al.′s conclusion that sexual orientation is innate.|$|E

2500|$|In the Old Testament, {{the books}} of Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy make similar {{statements}} about the treatment of strangers.

2500|$|Weinrich et al. (1993) and Weinberg et al. (1994) {{criticized the}} scale for lumping {{individuals}} <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> based on different dimensions of sexuality {{into the same}} categories. [...] When applying the scale, Kinsey considered two dimensions of sexual orientation: overt sexual experience and psychosexual reactions. Valuable information was lost by collapsing the two values into one final score. A person who has only predominantly same sex reactions is different from someone with relatively little reaction but lots of same sex experience. It would have been quite simple for Kinsey to have measured the two dimensions separately and report scores independently to avoid loss of information. Furthermore, {{there are more than}} two dimensions of sexuality to be considered. Beyond behavior and reactions, one could also assess attraction, identification, lifestyle etc. This is addressed by the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid.|$|E

2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different.</b> But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E

[...] She continued, noting Martin Luther King, Jr. as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, [...] "I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." [...] She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their [...] "love and support of the gay community." [...] She concluded, [...] "for people quoting the Bible, and using God as a defense mechanism: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, and Moses preached this—it's in every Holy book—'love thy neighbor as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and live our lives without fear. Amen." ...|$|E

6000|$|The fitness {{of women}} for {{political}} activity {{is not in}} present question; I am considering the fitness of political activity for women. For women as men say they are, wish them to be, and try to think them, it is unfit altogether--as unfit as anything else that [...] "mixes them up" [...] with us, compelling a communication and association that are not social. If we wish to have women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from ourselves in knowledge, character, accomplishments, manners; as different mentally as physically--and in these and in all odier expressible differences reside all the charms that they have for us--we must keep them, or they must keep themselves, in an environment unlike our own. One would think that obvious to the meanest capacity, and might even hope {{that it would be}} understood by the Daughters of Thunder. Possibly the Advanced One, hospitably accepting her karma, is not concerned to be charming to [...] "the likes o' we'"--would prefer the companionship of her blue gingham umbrella, her corkscrew curls, her epicene audiences and her name in the newspapers. Perhaps she is content with the comfort of her raucous voice. Therein she is unwise, for self-interest is the first law. When we no longer find woman charming we may {{find a way to make}} them more useful--more truly useful, even, than the speech-ladies would have them make themselves by competition. Really, there is nothing in the world between them and slavery but their power of interesting us; and that has its origin in the very differences which the Colonels are striving to abolish. God has made no law of miracles and none of His laws are going to be suspended in deference to woman's desire to achieve familiarity without contempt. If she wants to please she must retain some scrap of novelty; if she desires our respect she must not be always in evidence, disclosing the baser side of her character, as in competition with us she must do (as we do to one another) or lamentably fail. Mrs. Edmund Gosse, like [...] "Ouida," [...] Mrs. Atherton, and all other women of brains, declares that the taking of unfair advantages--the lack of magnanimity--is a leading characteristic of her sex. Mrs. Gosse adds, with reference to men's passive acquiescence in this monstrous folly of [...] "emancipation," [...] that possibly our quiet may be the calm before the storm; and she utters this warning, which, also, more strongly, [...] "Ouida" [...] has uttered: [...] "How would it be with us if the men should suddenly rise en masse and throw the whole surging lot of us into convents and harems?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{should it}} {{matter to me}} {{whether it is the}} custom of the English? I am not English,' said Laura Wing. Then her {{companion}} explained that he only wanted a general guidance--that with her (she was so kind) he had not the sense of having taken a liberty. The point was simply--and rather comprehensively and strenuously he began to set forth the point. Laura interrupted him; she said she didn't care about it and he almost irritated her by telling her she was kind. She was, but she was not pleased at its being recognised so soon; and he was still too importunate when he asked her whether she continued to go by American usage, didn't find that if one lived there one had to conform in a great many ways to the English. She was weary of the perpetual comparison, for she not only heard it from others--she heard it a great deal from herself. She held that there were certain differences you felt, if you belonged to one or the other nation, {{and that was the end}} of it: there was no use trying to express them. Those you could express were not real or not important ones and were not worth talking about. Mr. Wendover asked her if she liked English society and if it were superior to American; also if the tone were very high in London. She thought his questions 'academic'--the term she used to see applied in the Times to certain speeches in Parliament. Bending his long leanness over her (she had never seen a man whose material presence was so insubstantial, so unoppressive) and walking almost sidewise, to give her a proper attention, he struck her as innocent, as incapable of guessing that she had had a certain observation of life. They were talking about totally different things: English society, as he asked her judgment upon it and she had happened to see it, was an affair that he didn't suspect. If she were to give him that judgment it would be more than he doubtless bargained for; but she would do it not to make him open his eyes--only to relieve herself. She had thought of that before in regard to two or three persons she had met--of the satisfaction of breaking out with some of her feelings. It would make little difference whether the person understood her or not; the one who should do so best would be far from understanding everything. 'I want to get out of it, please--out of the set I live in, the one I have tumbled into through my sister, the people you saw just now. There are thousands of people in London <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from that and ever so much nicer; but I don't see them, I don't know how to get at them; and after all, poor dear man, what power have you to help me?'
