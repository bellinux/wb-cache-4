40|$|Non-proportional hazards {{have been}} {{observed}} in clinical trials. The log-rank test loses power and the standard Cox model generally produces biased estimates under such conditions. <b>Weighted</b> log-rank <b>tests</b> have been utilized to increase the test power; however, it is not intuitive how to interpret the <b>test</b> <b>result</b> {{in terms of the}} clinical effect. We propose a Cox-model based time-varying treatment effect estimate to complement the <b>weighted</b> log-rank <b>test.</b> The score test from the proposed model is equivalent to the <b>weighted</b> log-rank <b>test,</b> and a time-profile of the treatment effect can be obtained by fitting a time-varying covariate Cox model. Simulation results show that the proposed model preserves type-I error and achieve higher power than log-rank tests under non-proportional hazards scenarios. Whereas the standard Cox model produces biased effect estimates, the proposed model produces unbiased estimates if the weight function is correctly specified. It also achieves a better model fit and an enhanced flexibility to accommodate non-proportional hazards compared to the standard Cox model. The proposed approach makes the assumptions of the <b>weighted</b> log-rank <b>test</b> explicit and the validity of assumptions can be assessed based on prior knowledge or model goodness-of-fit. It also helps to translate the <b>weighted</b> log-rank <b>test</b> <b>results</b> into quantitative estimates of the treatment effect with intuitive interpretation.

We aimed to evaluate trained clinicians' ability to assess suicidality against a structured assessment made by trained raters. Method Treating clinicians classified 218 adolescent psychiatric outpatients {{suffering from a}} depressive mood disorder into three classes: 1 -no suicidal ideation, 2 -suicidal ideation, no suicidal acts, 3 -suicidal or self-harming acts. This classification was compared with a classification with identical content derived from the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL) made by trained raters. The convergence was assessed by kappa- and <b>weighted</b> kappa <b>tests.</b> <b>Results</b> The clinicians' classification to class 1 (no suicidal ideation) was 85 %, class 2 (suicidal ideation) 50 %, and class 3 (suicidal acts) 10 % concurrent with the K-SADS evaluation (γ 2 = 37. 1, df 4, p = 0. 000). Weighted kappa for the agreement of the measures was 0. 335 (CI = 0. 198 – 0. 471, p Conclusion There was only a modest agreement between the trained clinicians' suicidality evaluation and the K-SADS evaluation, especially concerning suicidal or self-harming acts.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} on-chip {{generation}} of <b>weighted</b> <b>test</b> sequences for synchronous sequential circuits. For combinational circuits, three weights, 0, 0. 5 and 1, are sufficient to achieve complete coverage of stuck-at faults, since these weights are sufficient to reproduce any specific test pattern.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} a histological diagnosis of cervical cancer following a given Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> and for a given history of Pap <b>test</b> <b>results</b> in a screened population across the full spectrum of possible cytological results. Methods: All the Pap screening results held on the New South Wales Pap Test Register for 1997 - 2003 (five million tests for 1. 87 million women) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the odds of having a histologically determined cervical cancer for a given Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> and <b>test</b> <b>result</b> history. The hazard ratios of having cervical cancer in relation to Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> histories were estimated: (i) in regard only to the last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> adjusting for age, frequency of Pap testing and proportion of high grade (≥cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN 2]) abnormalities found in a woman 2 ̆ 7 s total recorded <b>test</b> <b>result</b> history; and (ii) with regard to the last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> against the highest grade of cytological abnormality found prior to the last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> The hazard ratios are for a cancer diagnosis occurring before the next Pap test and were adjusted for age, quintile of socioeconomic status of residence, frequency of past Pap testing and proportion of high-grade abnormalities detected in each woman 2 ̆ 7 s prior Pap test history. The adjusted hazard ratios were then applied to the tabulated proportions of referent women with negative cytology in each broad age group, and for all women, to estimate the 2 ̆ 71 in n 2 ̆ 7 odds of being diagnosed histologically with cervical cancer for a given last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result,</b> and by a given last Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> for various prior Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> histories. Results: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, frequency of previous Pap testing and proportion of past high-grade screen-detected abnormalities, the adjusted hazard ratio of having a subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis for women with a negative Pap <b>test</b> <b>result</b> was 1 in 5546, compared with 1 in 833 for a low-grade epithelial abnormality (atypia, CIN 1), 1 in 56 for a high-grade epithelial abnormality and 1 in seven for a cytological prediction of cervical cancer.
