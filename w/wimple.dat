Deady represented him at trial and was to receive as payment Wimple’s land claim via his will. <b>Wimple</b> was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death, but was only hung after being recaptured from a jail break. In 1852, Deady was among many legal minds and politicians in the territory such as Joseph C. Avery and Robert Moore that signed a petition asking Governor John P. Gaines to pardon Nimrod O'Kelly after O'Kelly's controversial conviction for murder. O'Kelly was eventually spared from the gallows.|$|E
25|$|The north {{transept}} (or Priory End) windows, {{east and}} north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings. The trussed roof is possibly 16th century with {{tie beam support}} added in the 19th. The south transept (or Hall End) east and south windows are 14th century although partly restored. The 15th-century south transept roof trussing is of hammer beam construction, with curved collar braces springing from beams which are supported by curved chamfered brackets. Running on the wall from the hammer beams to the roof line are wind braces, and to the ridge beam is roof truss framing. Both transepts are separated from the nave by c.20th-century panels and doors rising part {{way to the top}} of the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head of a woman in a <b>wimple</b> carved at its apex, and a finial above.|$|E

She {{trained on the}} Greek island of Tinos, established {{a home for the}} order in a hamlet north of Athens, and undertook two tours of the United States in 1950 and 1952 in an effort to raise funds. Her mother was baffled by her actions, [...] "What can you say of a nun who smokes and plays canasta?", she said. Her daughter-in-law became queen of the Commonwealth realms in 1952, and Princess Andrew attended her coronation in June 1953, wearing a two-tone grey dress and <b>wimple</b> in the style of her nun's habit. However, the order eventually failed through a lack of suitable applicants.|$|E

500|$|The Troggs had a {{worldwide}} hit in 1966 with [...] "Wild Thing", written by American Chip Taylor. [...] Extolling {{the virtues of}} their seemingly unrepentant primitivism and sexually charged innuendo, the Troggs were the British band that Lester Bangs singled out as perhaps the quintessential [...] "punk" [...] band of the 1960s. [...] The Equals, a racially integrated band from North London featuring guitarist Eddy Grant, specialized in an upbeat style of rock; their 1966 recording [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] was a hit in Europe before becoming a British number one in 1968. [...] In keeping with the popularity of blues-based rock and the onset of psychedelic music in the mid-1960s, some of the harder-driving and more obscure bands associated with the mod scene in the UK are sometimes retroactively referred to as Freakbeat, which is sometimes viewed as the more stylish British parallel to garage rock. Several bands often mentioned as Freakbeat are the Creation, the Action, the Move, the Smoke, the Sorrows, and <b>Wimple</b> Winch.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace <b>Wimple</b> (Thompson, using a {{voice he}} later {{employed}} for the MGM-animated Droopy) – <b>Wimple</b> was a soft-spoken {{man in the}} Caspar Milquetoast vein. He would enter the episode uttering his mush-mouth catchphrase, [...] "Hello, folks!" [...] <b>Wimple</b> might recite a verse he'd written but more often would recount the latest incident in his ongoing battle with Sweetie-Face, his [...] "big old wife” who had the physique and demeanor of a drill sergeant on a bad day. Sweetie-Face was a regular unseen character (actually of course, this being radio, unheard character), appearing in the show only from Wallace's perspective. “Wimp,” as Fibber called him, often reported provoking an overreaction from Sweetie-Face, followed by his attempt at revenge {{in a way that}} could be prankish, painful, or in some stories potentially fatal. One day (03/09/48) when he asked Sweetie-Face what she was doing, Wallace said she told him she was [...] "practicing her weight-lifting." [...] Wallace said he told Sweetie-Face, [...] "My goodness, you do that every time you get up out of a chair.” [...] “Uh oh,” fretted Molly. “And then when I regained consciousness,” continued <b>Wimple,</b> “she'd left the room.” With a typically evil chuckle, Wallace said that he got even by bolting her 200-pound barbell to the floor, causing her to strain so hard the next time she lifted weights that she popped her girdle. Passive-aggressive behavior edging well over the line into domestic violence characterized Wimple's stories. Radio network censors in the 1940s blocked any reference to certain subjects including sex, but the dark humor about domestic violence that was allowed here and in The Honeymooners would likely not be written into a network-TV sitcom today. Though the term “wimp” as used to describe a weak-willed person predated Fibber McGee and Molly, the <b>Wimple</b> character and Fibber's nickname for him may have contributed to a surge in popular use.|$|E

2500|$|Married {{women in}} Northern and Western Europe wore {{some type of}} headcovering. [...] The barbet was a band of linen that passed under the chin and was pinned {{on top of the}} head; it descended from the earlier <b>wimple</b> (in French, barbe), which was now worn only by older women, widows, and nuns. [...] The barbet was worn with a linen fillet or headband, or with a linen cap called a coif, with or without a couvrechef (kerchief) or veil overall. It passed out of fashion by mid-century. Unmarried girls simply braided the hair to keep the dirt out.|$|E
2500|$|The uniform {{adopted by}} the young female pioneers of this {{movement}} was named al-Islāmī (Islamic dress) and {{was made up of}} an [...] "al-jilbāb—an unfitted, long-sleeved, ankle-length gown in austere solid colors and thick opaque fabric—and al-khimār, a head cover resembling a nun's <b>wimple</b> that covers the hair low to the forehead, comes under the chin to conceal the neck, and falls down over the chest and back". In addition to the basic garments that were mostly universal within the movement, additional measures of modesty could be taken depending on how conservative the followers wished to be. Some women choose to also utilize a face covering (al-niqāb) that leaves only eye slits for sight, as well as both gloves and socks in order to reveal no visible skin.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{writers on}} costume history use hennin {{to cover a}} variety of {{different}} styles. [...] Almost all agree that the steeple-cone style was a hennin, and the truncated ("flowerpot") versions, and many also include the heart-shaped open-centred fabric tubes of the earlier part of the century. Some also use the term to cover beehive-shaped fabric head-coverings of the mid-century (as in the Van der Weyden workshop painting in the Gallery). Others also use it for the head-dresses divided to right and left of {{the early part of the}} century, such as those in which Christine de Pisan is usually depicted (see Gallery). [...] In some of these only white cloth is visible, but in later examples worn by aristocrats rich fabric can be seen through translucent veils. Some use it for the horned hairstyle with a <b>wimple</b> on top.|$|E

2500|$|The Jordans were {{experts at}} {{transforming}} the ethnic humor of vaudeville into more rounded comic characters, no doubt {{due in part}} to the affection felt for the famous supporting cast members who voiced these roles, including Bill Thompson (as the Old Timer and <b>Wimple),</b> Harold Peary (as Gildersleeve), Gale Gordon (as La Trivia), Arthur Q. Bryan (as Dr. Gamble; Bryan also voiced Elmer Fudd for the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes cartoons, which also borrowed lines from Fibber McGee and Molly from time to time), Isabel Randolph (as Mrs. Uppington), Marlin Hurt (a white male who played in dialect the McGee's maid, Beulah), and others. They were also expert at their own running gags and catchphrases, many of which entered the American vernacular: [...] "That ain't the way I heeard it!"; [...] "'T'ain't funny, McGee!" [...] and [...] "Heavenly days!" [...] were the three best known.|$|E

She wrote, [...] "I applied myself especially to practice little virtues, not having the facility to perform great ones ... In her letters from this period of her novitiate, Thérèse returned over and over to the theme of littleness, referring to herself as a grain of sand, an image she borrowed from Pauline...'Always littler, lighter, in order to be lifted more easily by the breeze of love.'
