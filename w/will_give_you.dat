5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

A writer from Singersroom praised it as a [...] "tear jerker", describing it as a [...] "throwback music video" [...] that was appropriate for Valentine's Day.

She wrote that the visual was [...] "a family affair that <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> all the feels," [...] saying that [...] "it's great {{to get a glimpse}} at [...] happily ever after".

[...] They do send him the money he requests, and– although it is not described directly in the novel– endure significant hardship for themselves as a result. His family, absent while he is in Paris, becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice. Although Goriot and Vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him, {{by the end of the}} novel they are gone and he is alone.|$|E

500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] {{starts off}} like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I {{need to think about}} it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If you do your homework/ Baby I <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> more". It also has influences of Spanish music. Groove inspired music is present in [...] "Dance 2Night", which featured Timberlake.|$|E

[...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company {{went on to say that}} it offers other healthier items such as salads and that customers are free to choose their own foods and modify them as they desire.|$|E
500|$|To {{ward off}} the threat of vampires and disease, twin {{brothers}} would yoke twin oxen to a plow and make a furrow with it around their village. An egg would be broken and a nail driven into the floor beneath the bier {{of the house of}} a recently deceased person. Two or three elderly women would attend the cemetery the evening after the funeral and stick five hawthorn pegs or old knives into the grave: one at the position of the deceased's chest, and the other four at the positions of his arms and legs. Other texts maintain that running backwards uphill with a lit candle and a turtle would ward off a stalking vampire. Alternately, they may surround the grave with a red woolen thread, ignite the thread, and wait until it was burnt up. If a noise was heard at night and suspected to be made by a vampire sneaking around someone's house, one would shout [...] "Come tomorrow, and I <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> some salt," [...] or [...] "Go, pal, get some fish, and come back." ...|$|E

500|$|Pool of Radiance was {{the first}} in a four-part series of {{computer}} D adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: Curse of the Azure Bonds (1989), Secret of the Silver Blades (1990), and Pools of Darkness (1991). The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance. Hillsfar is described instead, by the reviewers of Dragon, as [...] "a value-added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel". A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items. Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance, but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds. A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that [...] "you can transfer your characters from Pool of Radiance and it's a good idea to do so. It <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a headstart in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Arriving in California in June, Stevens {{accompanied}} a {{group of}} women led by Charlotte Anita Whitney to meet with House Appropriations Committee members who were meeting at the Palace Hotel, in San Francisco. The women had been assured that {{they would be able to}} present their issues, but the chair, Representative John J. Fitzgerald of New York, refused to allow it. Undaunted, Whitney and Stevens continued their planning efforts for the Panama Pacific Exposition CUWS Congress in San Francisco. In San Francisco at the CUWS headquarters in 1915, Stevens discussed the strategy of employing a [...] "million-vote smile", positing that smiling was a useful tool in the fight to win over men's support. [...] "Smile on men and they <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a vote. Look severe and they won't," [...] she stated. However, when Alice Paul arrived two weeks before the event, she canceled choral events, a parade and a mass meeting that had been planned for the Scottish Rite Hall. Stevens had been involved in supervising each of these events, though local women planned and orchestrated them. Paul did keep the luncheon and a ball to be held at the California building of the exposition. After the September Congress, Stevens had planned to remain in San Francisco and run the exposition booth of CUWS, but she was forced to return to Washington because the eastern delegate Margaret Whittemore had left due to her marriage. Stevens immediately began planning for a convention to be held in Washington in December.|$|E

500|$|The Croatian {{government}} {{played a}} [...] "double game" [...] in Bosnia and Herzegovina and [...] "a military solution required Bosnia as an ally, but {{a diplomatic solution}} required Bosnia as a victim". Tuđman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party held important positions in the Bosnian government including the premiership and the ministry of defence, but despite this carried out a separate policy and refused for the HVO to be integrated into ARBiH. Jerko Doko, the Bosnian defence minister, gave the HVO priority in the acquisition of military weapons. In January 1992, Tuđman had arranged for Stjepan Kljuić, president of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH) who favored cooperating with the Bosniaks towards a unified Bosnian state, to be ousted and replaced by Mate Boban, who favored Croatia to annex Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A rift existed in the party between Croats from ethnically mixed areas of central and northern Bosnia and those from Herzegovina. Milivoj Gagro, prewar Croat mayor of Mostar and ally of Kljuić said: [...] "The secessionist policy [...] was consistently supported by the Herzegovina side, not by Sarajevo, Posavina, or Central Bosnia Croats. [...] Croats from Central Bosnia and Posavina, {{as well as those}} from urban centers who lived with Muslims and Serbs, thought differently. But when the war picked up, Posavina Croats were attacked, Sarajevo was surrounded [...] Kljuić was sidelined and Boban came in with idea [...] in this area. [...] When they [...] felt they could not survive any more they lifted their hands and accepted their fate. And the Herzegovina Croats promised them the stars in the sky and told them [...] "come here and we <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a place." [...] And what happened? It resulted in an exodus. And all these miserable Croat refugee communities that look absolutely ugly." ...|$|E
