The results obtained show a change in quality between the runoff entering the sewer network and the combined storm water flow at the sewer's outlet. In particular, an increase was observed in the concentrations of SS, VSS, COD, BOD 5, Cu and in the settling velocities of particles. The assessment of the contribution of different sources to the pollution showed that the organic layer at water-sediment interface in the sewer is the main source of <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow</b> pollution for suspended solids, volatile solids, particle-bound COD and BOD 5, and copper.

Several investigations were carried out between 1994 and 2005 in order to evaluate the aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon loads entering combined sewers, as well as the pollutant fluxes conveyed by dry and <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flows</b> at catchment outlets.

The sizes and capacities of all major components are dependant on the predicted amount of wastewater flow that will originate from the contributory areas within the proposed catchment. The reliability of flow estimates depends on the accuracy of many assumptions.

5000|$|Few sewage {{treatment}} facilities were {{constructed in the}} late 19th century to treat combined wastewater because of the associated difficulties. There were only 27 U.S. cities with wastewater treatment works by 1892, most of them [...] "treating" [...] wastewater through land application. Of these 27 cities, 26 had separate sanitary and storm water sewer systems, thus facilitating wastewater treatment, {{because there was no}} need for large capacitites to accommodate <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flows.</b> Furthermore, there was a belief that the diluted combined wastewater was not harmful to receiving waters, due to the natural dilution and self-purifying capacity of rivers, lakes and the sea. In the early 20th century a debate evolved between those who thought it was in the best interest of public health to construct wastewater treatment facilities and those who believed building them was unnecessary. Nevertheless, many cities began to opt for separate sewer systems, creating favorable conditions for adding wastewater treatment plants in the future.|$|R
40|$|Sewer systems convey mostly {{dry weather}} flow, coming from {{domestic}} and industrial sanitary sewage {{as well as}} infiltration flow, and stormwater due to meteoric precipitations. Traditionally, in urban drainage two types of sewer systems are adopted: separate and combined sewers. The former convey dry and <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow</b> separately into two different networks, while the latter convey dry and <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow</b> together. Which is the best solution in terms of cost-benefit analysis still remains a controversial subject. The present study was aimed at comparing the pollution loads discharged to receiving bodies by Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) for different kinds of sewer systems (combined and separate). To accomplish this objective, a comparison between the two systems was carried out using results from simulations of catchments characterised by different dimensions, population densities and water supply rate. The analysis {{was based on a}} parsimonious mathematical model able to simulate the sewer system as well as the WWTP during both dry and wet weather. The rain series employed for the simulations was six years long. Several pollutants, both dissolved and particulate, were modelled. The results confirmed the uncertainties in the choice of one system versus the other, emphasising the concept that case-by-case solutions have to be undertaken. Further, the compared systems showed different responses in terms of effectiveness in reducing the discharged mass to the RWB in relation to the particular pollutant taken into account...|$|E
30|$|A {{significant}} concern regarding {{sediment transport}} with inflow is solid matter deposition in the pipe channel. It {{is essential to}} determine the limiting velocity (at a constant slope) in dry weather flow (DWF) for sediment transport without deposition. Moreover, the pipe diameter should be sufficiently capable of transporting maximum flow in <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow</b> (WWF). Sedimentation can increase the bed roughness and decrease the cross-sectional area of the channel. The long-term accumulation of sediment on the bed can {{increase the risk of}} stabilization and cementation, thus causing transport capacity reduction. Therefore, a criterion for predicting the limiting velocity to prevent sediment deposition is essential.|$|E
40|$|Sediments in {{combined}} systems (CS) {{significantly increase}} loads emitting via combined sewer overflows. In future prognosticated {{changes in the}} storm water characteristics, decreasing popu-lation or water conservation will probably worsen these effects. Various actions can prevent the formation of large quantities of sediments whose amounts change considerably over time and space within the sewer. Information about the whereabouts of deposit {{can be obtained by}} visual inspection or mathematical modeling. Both approaches require large efforts. Furthermore, presently available deterministic sewer-quality models with sediment transport were found to be over-parameterized and inherit large uncertainties. Mathematical models as the semi-stochastic sediment transport model are still able to efficiently identify areas with risk of sedimentation. This category of models does not use a single parameter set obtained from calibrating the quality model but varies these parameters instead stochastically within a Monte-Carlo Simulation. The investigation aimed (1) to model the amount of mobile sediments that effect the load distribution during <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow</b> and (2) to quantify the areas with risk of sedimentation within a combined sewerage. A detailed field study showed that readily erodible sediments are most important pollutant based process affecting the load distribution during <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow.</b> Based on this finding, a structured hydrological-stochastic sewer quality model was developed. The simplified conceptual model represents the whole sewer system including the pipes with small cross-sections (less than or equal to DN 300) because in small CS the corresponding part amounts to more than 50 % of the total length. The simulations’ results were compared against field data. The results demonstrate validity of the approach. The investigation showed in particular:(1) The simulated total length of sewers with risk of sedimentation of 2 ’ 998 m agrees well with monitoring data of 3 ’ 121 m.

The secondary objective was to investigate possible sources of heavy metals during rainfall events. The concentrations of the three dissolved trace metals Cu, Zn and Fe were measured at 13 sites on five streams during base flow conditions and during runoff events (<b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow)</b> in the Wellington region between January and July 2011. More than 240 base flow and 100 <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow</b> samples have been analysed for the three dissolved metals. Additionally, rainfall, roof runoff and paved surface runoff samples have been collected and analysed. The analysis was performed by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (FAAS). A pre-concentration procedure using Chelex- 100, a chelating polymeric resin bead, was developed and successfully used to enhance the concentrations of dissolved Cu and dissolved Zn. The recorded data were compared to the recommended long-term (chronic) toxicity triggers; the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council freshwater toxicity trigger values (ANZECC (2000) TV) for dissolved Cu and Zn, and the Canadian trigger value (CTV) for dissolved Fe. Additionally, the concentrations of dissolved Cu and Zn in storm water samples were compared against the recommended short-term (acute) toxicity triggers, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA 2006) Criteria Maximum Concentrations (CMC). The medians of dissolved heavy metals concentrations; Cu, Zn, and Fe, {{all of which are}} potentially toxic to aquatic life, exceeded the long-term (chronic) toxicity guidelines at one of the studied sites for Fe, nine sites (69 %) for Cu and 10 sites (77 %) for Zn in base flow conditions. Comparison of base flow monitoring data to previous reports showed that the concentrations of the studied metals have increased over the last five years. Storm water (<b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flow</b> conditions) contained elevated levels of dissolved heavy metals in comparison to base flow concentrations which is consistent with what has been reported previously. Dissolved Cu and Zn exceeded the acute toxicity criteria at sites of suburban residential areas. The median of dissolved Fe concentration exceeded the sustained toxicity exposure trigger at eight of the studied sites (61 %). Distinct catchment type contaminant concentrations (dissolved Cu and Zn) were observed during storm runoff events with a concentration pattern of suburban residential > commercial > light residential > rural catchment. Dissolved Fe exhibited a similar pattern but in this case the concentration in rural catchments was higher than in light residential catchments. These observations were attributed to the high traffic of vehicles passing nearby the area; accumulated particulate materials; and corrosion of materials containing heavy metals, such as galvanised and copper roofs, gutter systems and building construction materials. The strongest and most obvious first flush effect was observed with dissolved Cu followed by Zn where the phenomenon was observed in six storm runoff events for Cu and five events for Zn. The first flush effect of dissolved Fe was present in three out of eight storm runoff events. The concentrations of dissolved metals were of the same order of magnitude as those previously reported for the Wellington region, but this work recorded the highest expected concentrations, particularly, for dissolved Fe. The reported data are consistent with data sets from other New Zealand regions. The investigation of possible sources of dissolved heavy metals in storm runoff samples showed that rainfall water contained markedly elevated concentrations of dissolved Zn and smaller Cu concentrations, 0. 04 - 0. 075 and 0. 0018 - 0. 01 mg/L respectively, in comparison to the ANZECC (2000) TVs, 0. 008 and 0. 0014 mg/L respectively. The concentrations of dissolved Fe were below the CTV level of 0. 3 mg/L. Most studies conducted in New Zealand did {{not take into account the}} atmospheric precipitation contribution to the elevated concentrations of dissolved metals during runoff events. Roof runoff samples had similar dissolved Cu and Fe concentration to those recorded in atmospheric rainfall water, but Zn was found to be higher in galvanised roof runoff. First flush samples from roof runoff had higher concentrations of all three metals than the delayed runoff samples, indicating the presence of accumulated particles containing metals. Paved surface runoff samples had concentrations of dissolved Cu and Zn higher than the chronic toxicity triggers, but the medians did not exceed the acute toxicity guidelines. The value of the median for the concentrations of dissolved Fe was below the CTV criteria.

Although the extensive data set compiled herein has emphasized the high variability in WWF quality from one rain event to the next, no scale effect could be observed for a given rain event on pollutant concentrations, distributions between dissolved and particulate phases, pollutant contents and loads. Such results are of prime importance since they suggest (i) no spatial scale influence on WWF quality for the considered catchments and (ii) similar dominant sources and transfer processes at the various spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 6 {{years since the}} {{finalization}} of the NPDES Phase II, stormwater rules, there has been tremendous growth {{in the development of}} the stormwater controls to reduce pollutant loadings in urban runoff. As a result, there has been a vast increase in the number of decision makers who must make day to day decisions regarding specific site designs to ensure that they incorporate the necessary controls to meet the objectives of maintaining and improving the quality of runoff into our receiving waters. With this expanding demand there has emerged there is a multitude of structural and non-structural controls available to design an appropriate treatment train for a specific site’s needs. This paper will outline a basic structure for the utilization of filtration techniques to help meet the stated objectives for reducing pollutants in stormwater runoff. It will review various options that are available including the types of filtration techniques, the variety of filtration media that are available, and factors to consider when making the proper selection decision. Before urbanization, <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flows</b> were controlled by many natural processes, including infiltration. With rapid urbanization, however, increased areas o...|$|R
40|$|An older urban {{district}} in Wuhan, China, is transitioning from discharging sewage and stormwater directly into lakes, to directing the sewage to {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs). Dealing with polluted stormwater discharge is a great challenge. Stormwater runoff from an urban catchment with a combined sewer system was sampled and analyzed over a three-year period. Results indicate that <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flows</b> account for 66 %, 31 %, 17 %, and 13 % of the total load of suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively. The first flush of COD and SS was significant in all runoff events. More than 50 % of the SS and COD loads were transported by the first 30 % of runoff volume. Storage and treatment of the first 10 mm from each combined sewer overflow event could reduce more than 70 % of the annual COD overflow load. An integrated solution is recommended, consisting of a tank connected to the WWTP and a detention pond, to store and treat the combined sewer overflow (CSO). These results may be helpful in mitigating CSO pollution for many other urban areas in China and other developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Street litter is {{a growing}} problem both in {{residential}} and commercial areas despite decades of anti-litter campaign efforts. During urban <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> <b>flows,</b> litter is transported into receiving waterways and can have a devastating impact on the environment. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the past and present Australian littering culture and its potential impact on the environment. To this end, photographs from the National library archives are analysed together with results obtained from a field litter study conducted in Brisbane. Results reveal the major source of litter is essentially organic, consisting of grass clippings, leaves, twigs and fine sediments. On pedestrian routes and in open spaces near public services, litter is dominated by cigarettes butts. Smoking bans may have shifted the problem of disposing the cigarettes butts from ashtrays to the outdoor environment while loitering or walking on streets. Observations also show that public spaces where greenery is cultivated to promote pleasant surroundings are used as a dumping site for human derived material. While architects and planners are keen to promote the concept of green roofs’ and walls the potential to generate street litter increases...|$|R
