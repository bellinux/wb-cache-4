500|$|Tom Rothman, {{chairman}} of the film's co-financier Fox Filmed Entertainment, described the film's marketing strategy thus: [...] "How are we marketing it? It's Cruise and Spielberg. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>do</b> we need to do?" [...] The strategy made sense; coming into the film, Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $2.8 billion, while Cruise's resume featured 23 films and $2 billion in domestic revenues. With their combined 30% take of the film's box office though, sources such as BusinessWeek's Ron Grover predicted the studios {{would have a hard}} time making the money needed to break even. Despite the outward optimism, as a more adult-oriented, darker film than typical blockbusters, the studio held different box office expectations for the movie than they would a more family friendly film. Entertainment Weekly projected the film would gross $40 million domestic in its opening weekend, and Variety predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a [...] "commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run." ...|$|E

[...] Sarah Fitzmaurice of Daily Mail also gave a positive review for the video praising its simple and energetic concept accompanied by the [...] "fierce outfits".

[...] A writer of The Huffington Post called the video a [...] "fresh take on a New Edition classic" [...] and concluded that it was a [...] "lot more simple than it sounds." [...] Lisa Potter of Marie Claire also praised the energy and Beyoncé's figure in the video, writing, [...] "The pregnant superstar puts on another energetic performance during the video, showing off her fabulous figure in a skimpy black leotard complete with a military fetish cap and Isabel Marant sneakers, before changing into a series of tailored suits." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson's Dangerous era adding, [...] "While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé's [...] 'Love On Top' video is too straightforward, we actually think it's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing, dance, look fuhLAWless and wear a cute hat! <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>do</b> you people need?!" [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the video as a direct homage to New Edition's [...] "If It Isn't Love" [...] but added that when the song's key changes start, [...] "Beyoncé and her posse of backup dancers get a bit brassier and fancier". She further wrote that the video was something that Phil Collins [...] "would be proud" [...] of.|$|E

2500|$|The African press named Uruguay {{public enemy}} No.1 and {{described}} them as cheats. Suárez was unapologetic about his handball, stating [...] "I {{made the best}} save of the tournament." [...] Suárez boasted after the match of his handball save, claiming that [...] "The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me," [...] {{a reference to the}} handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac argued that Suárez's actions were [...] "really shocking," [...] describing the result as a [...] "football injustice." [...] Uruguay's coach Óscar Tabárez defended Suárez: [...] "Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use...We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake. Yes, he stuck his hand out, but it's not cheating. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>do</b> you want? Is Suárez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty?

I'm back in movies now. I've got three lined up, {{and this is the}} fucking grand news. Tusk was the {{absolute}} bridge to Clerks III. Because of Tusk, I got my financing for Clerks III." [...] Smith continued, [...] "A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get Clerks III made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was Tusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>do</b> you have?'
