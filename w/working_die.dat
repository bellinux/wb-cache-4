25|$|The Denver branch began life in 1863 as {{the local}} assay office, just five years after gold was {{discovered}} in the area. By {{the turn of the}} century, the office was bringing in over $5 million in annual gold and silver deposits, and in 1906, the Mint opened its new Denver branch. Denver uses a D mint mark and strikes coinage only for circulation, although it did strike, along with three other mints, the $10 gold 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Commemorative. It also produces its own <b>working</b> <b>dies,</b> as well as <b>working</b> <b>dies</b> for the other mints. Although the Denver and Dahlonega mints used the same mint mark D, they were never in operation at the same time, so this is not a source of ambiguity.|$|R

5000|$|The reverse's central design figure, {{for which}} the coin is named, is an {{interlocking}} chain with 15 links, representing the 15 American states in existence at that time. Both the words [...] "" [...] and the fraction [...] "" [...] appear within the chain. Along the outer edge is inscribed [...] "". On the first <b>working</b> <b>die,</b> the engraver failed to allow adequate room for the entire inscription, {{and it had to}} be abbreviated to [...] "". These early dies were cut by hand, rather than being made from master hubs as is the practice today.|$|E
50|$|Doubled dies are {{a result}} {{of the way in which}} in the United States Mint's dies are created. Before 1997, die pairs (hammer die and anvil die) were made by hubs that {{contained}} the raised design elements that were intended to appear on the coin. The blank dies were heated (to soften them) and then were pressed against the hubs to transfer the design from the hub to the working dies. One impression was not enough in every case to transfer the design elements from the hub to the die, so multiple impressions were required to transfer enough of the design. For this reason, after the first impression was made, the die was reheated and prepared for a second impression. The mint workers would use guides to align the hub and the <b>working</b> <b>die</b> perfectly to prevent overlapping, or a doubled die. It is when mint workers failed to align dies properly during this process that doubled dies were produced. In many instances three to four impressions were required, which could but rarely led to tripled and quadrupled dies.|$|E
5000|$|Impression-die forging is {{also called}} [...] "closed-die forging". In impression-die forging, the metal {{is placed in}} a die {{resembling}} a mold, which is attached to an anvil. Usually, the hammer die is shaped as well. The hammer is then dropped on the workpiece, causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities. The hammer is generally {{in contact with the}} workpiece on the scale of milliseconds. Depending on the size and complexity of the part, the hammer may be dropped multiple times in quick succession. Excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities, forming what is referred to as [...] "flash". The flash cools more rapidly {{than the rest of the}} material; this cool metal is stronger than the metal in the die, so it helps prevent more flash from forming. This also forces the metal to completely fill the die cavity. After forging, the flash is removed.In commercial impression-die forging, the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form. The first impression is used to distribute the metal into the rough shape in accordance to the needs of later cavities; this impression is called an [...] "edging", [...] "fullering", or [...] "bending" [...] impression. The following cavities are called [...] "blocking" [...] cavities, in which the piece is working into a shape that more closely resembles the final product. These stages usually impart the workpiece with generous bends and large fillets. The final shape is forged in a [...] "final" [...] or [...] "finisher" [...] impression cavity. If there is only a short run of parts to be done, then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features.Impression-die forging has been improved in recent years through increased automation which includes induction heating, mechanical feeding, positioning and manipulation, and the direct heat treatment of parts after forging.One variation of impression-die forging is called [...] "flashless forging", or [...] "true closed-die forging". In this type of forging, the die cavities are completely closed, which keeps the workpiece from forming flash. The major advantage to this process is that less metal is lost to flash. Flash can account for 20 to 45% of the starting material. The disadvantages of this process include additional cost due to a more complex die design and the need for better lubrication and workpiece placement.There are other variations of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed after it has solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single cavity die. The flash is trimmed, then the part is quench hardened. Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).Closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make <b>working</b> <b>die</b> cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume.

5000|$|The {{engraving}} {{was unusually}} minute and required very close and incessant labor for several weeks.

50|$|On , Weinman {{wrote to}} Joyce, asking how the Mint was {{getting on with}} the dies for the half dollar and dime, and expressing his {{willingness}} to come to Philadelphia. Joyce replied two days later, informing him that {{the design of the}} half dollar was being reduced in size to prevent recurrence of the edge difficulties, and informing him of the beaded border. Weinman responded hoping that Joyce would prevent the figure of Liberty from being unduly reduced, and rendering his account. As the sculptor and superintendent corresponded, the Mint began the work of converting the Barber-modified designs to <b>working</b> <b>dies</b> from which circulation coins could be struck, but Joyce interceded before coining could begin. The Philadelphia Mint superintendent, who had the support of von Engelken, felt that Barber's modifications were unnecessary. Joyce believed that coins closer to Weinman's concept could be struck by lowering the relief slightly, adjusting the force with which the Mint's presses struck the planchets or blanks, and better preparing the planchets for striking. Joyce's position prevailed, and Barber and his department prepared <b>working</b> <b>dies</b> for striking of circulation pieces, omitting Barber's beaded border and wide space between rim and design. Working dies were at the Denver and San Francisco Mints on , and production began at all three mints soon after.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{an artist}} creates a large plaster {{model of the}} coin. The plaster model is then coated with rubber. The rubber mold is then used to make an epoxy galvano. All of this takes place {{on a scale of}} around eight inches. Next, a Janvier {{reducing}} lathe takes several days to reduce the image onto a steel master hub. The master hub is then heat treated to make it hard. The master hub is then to make only a few master dies via hubbing, which involves pressing the master hub into a steel blank to impress the image into the die. The master die is then used to form as many working hubs as needed through the same process, and then the working hubs are put through the same process to form the <b>working</b> <b>dies.</b> These <b>working</b> <b>dies</b> are the actual dies which will strike coins. The process of transferring the hub to the die can be repeated as many times as necessary in order to form the number of dies needed to make the number of coins required. The difference between a hub and a die is that the hub has a raised image and a die has an [...] image, so one forms the other.|$|R
40|$|In {{hot forging}} operations, the die {{surfaces}} and the nearest surface {{layers of the}} die undergo mechanical and thermal cycles which significantly influence their service life. The real thermal and mechanical cycles have been previously investigated in forging plants by measurements and numerical simulation, and a reasonable variation window of process parameters has been determined. A new simulative test applied to AISI H 11 hot <b>working</b> <b>die</b> steel {{has been used to}} generate failure data in conditions {{similar to those of the}} forging dies, but under a more controlled and economical method. Fracture surfaces of specimens for different tests observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicate that both thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) and creep phenomena can be considered to be main damage mechanisms and their contribution to the failure differs as testing conditions vary. As a result of the experiments, the failure is affected by both thermo-mechanical cycle and resting time at high temperature. Therefore, the authors developed a new lifetime prediction model obtained by combining the damage evolution laws, at each cycle, for pure creep and pure TMF. This combination was based on the linear accumulation rule. The damage evolution law for pure creep is obtained by modifying Rabotnov’s law in order to suit the case of actual hot forging cycles, where temperature and stress vary widely. The damage evolution law for pure TMF is based on a generalization of the Wohler–Miner law. This law is modified in order to take into account the presence of thermal cycle and thermal gradient. Comparison between the experimental cycles to failure and the predicted ones was performed using tests excluded in the determination of the coefficients. The conclusion was that the accuracy of prediction appears to be quite good and that the linear accumulation and interaction of TMF and creep is confirmed...|$|E
