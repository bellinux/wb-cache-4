40|$|None of the {{existing}} methods conforms {{to the requirements of}} a genuinely “ideal ” mass deacidification process. Beside the efficacy of deacidification processes, economic, safety and environmental risks are connected with the different systems. The efficacy of stabilisation of highly lignified <b>wood-containing</b> <b>paper</b> by the carbonated magnesium propylate in the liquified gas of the 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 -heptafluoropropane (HFC 227) was measured and compared with deacidification of the same paper by hexamethyldisiloxane, and air-water based deacidifying processes. The <b>wood-containing</b> <b>paper</b> test books were deacidified in Preservation Academy Leipzig, air-conditioned at the relative humidity RH = 50 %, and aged in sealed bags at 96 ± 2 °C. The kinetics of folding endurance (ω), tensile strength (lt) were measured and the indexes of relative increase of the lifetime (Sτ, ω), the folding endurance (Sω, t) and the tensile strength (Slt, t) were calculated. The process was evaluated through multifactorial evaluation according to requirements of the Consortium KnihaSK and the Library of Congress. The deacidification by carbonated magnesium propylate dissolved in HFC 227 fulfilled neither the Consortium KnihaSK nor the Library of Congress requirement for the lifetime increase (Sτ,ω= 1. 3). It did not improve the mechanical permanence of the <b>wood-containing</b> <b>paper</b> (Sω, 15 = 1; Slt, 15 = 1. 15). The comparative evaluation proved the superiority of the HMDO as well as air-water based deacidifying systems over the HFC based system for the <b>wood-containing</b> <b>paper,</b> which is an important sort of the paper in archives and libraries...|$|E
40|$|Pitch-related {{deposition}} {{has been}} a significant issue in paper mills that produce <b>wood-containing</b> <b>paper</b> grades. A component analysis showed that a mill deposit sample was a mixture of wood resin, fiber, metal cations, and other inorganics. Based on the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method, some critical parameters, including pH, metal cations, and their interactions, on the thermal stability of pitch-related deposits were studied. The valency of metal cations determined the ability of capturing pitch the formation of deposits. Trivalent Al 3 + or Fe 3 + ions had much stronger effects than divalent Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, or Mn 2 +. It was also found that a higher pH and trivalent Al 3 + or Fe 3 + increased the thermal stability of deposits formed in colloidal pitch solutions...|$|E
40|$|PCC {{has become}} the {{preferred}} solution in uncoated woodfree papers and is now expanding into woodcontaining papers, specifically SC magazine papers. The replacement of kaolin fillers with CaCO 3 has been slower in <b>wood-containing</b> <b>paper</b> grades than in wood-free papers. This is mainly due to alkaline darkening and printability {{issues related to the}} higher permeability and rounded shape of calcium carbonate fillers. However, these obstacles can be overcome by applying new engineered calcium carbonates designed to improve printing properties. This paper is focusing on the interactions between filler types (engineered precipitated calcium carbonates and kaolin) and paper structure, in particular the Z-direction filler distribution on gravure print through of SC-papers. Good printability in terms of low strike through and high ink hold out {{is a result of the}} ink staying on the surface of the paper – it is a paper surface property. Consequently, only filler present at or close to the surface can impact good ink strike through and hold out. But different formers can give significant differences in Z-direction filler distribution. These filler distributions were simulated in a Dynamic Sheet Former (DSF) by adjusting the filler dosing rate during the sheet forming process...|$|E

This study indicates that an improved surface smoothness can be attained on TMP-based <b>wood-containing</b> <b>papers</b> through high-temperature reject refining. Under these conditions the degree of irreversible fibre collapse increased. Results from tests of the fibre-wall, fibre surface characteristics, pulp yield and sheet brightness show only marginal differences at high temperatures compared to standard reject refining. Experiments in which laboratory sheets were moistened showed that {{a high degree of}} irreversible fibre collapse correlates with surface smoothness...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Paper is {{used for}} various {{purposes}} in hospitals. Generally, {{there are two different}} types of paper, which are commonly used in our facility: wood-free paper, and paper containing wood. We compared the recoverable proportion of methicillin-resistant (MRSA; ATCC 43300) from the surface of such papers. Method: The papers were divided into two groups: Group 1 : wood-free paper; Group 2 : paper containing wood. The papers were contaminated in a standardized procedure with 0. 1 mL of a 5 × 10 CFU MRSA/mL stock solution. Results: The recoverable proportion of MRSA was higher in the <b>wood-containing</b> <b>papers</b> than in the papers without wood (P= 0. 043). Conclusion: This study indicates that if paper is purchased for healthcare facilities it should not contain wood, but rather wood-free paper types should be considered...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} three alternative {{processes for}} producing microfibrillated cellulose (MFC; {{also referred to}} as cellulose nanofibrils, CNF) in which bleached pulp fibres are first pretreated and then homogenized using a high-pressure homogenizer. In one process, fibre cell wall delamination was facilitated by a combined enzymatic and mechanical pretreatment. In the two other processes, cell wall delamination was facilitated by pretreatments that introduced anionically charged groups into the fibre wall, by means of either a carboxymethylation reaction or irreversibly attaching carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to the fibres. All three processes are industrially feasible and enable energy-efficient production of MFC. Using these processes, MFC can be produced with an energy consumption of 500 – 2300 kWh/tonne. These materials have been characterized in various ways and it has been demonstrated that the produced MFCs are approximately 5 – 30 nm wide and up to several microns long. The MFCs were also evaluated in a number of applications in paper. The carboxymethylated MFC was used to prepare strong free-standing barrier films and to coat <b>wood-containing</b> <b>papers</b> to improve the surface strength and reduce the linting propensity of the papers. MFC, produced with an enzymatic pretreatment, was also produced at pilot scale and was studied in a pilot-scale paper making trial as a strength agent added at the wet-end for highly filled papers.

30|$|Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopy was applied to visualize inside fibers stained with a fluorescent dye, and the fiber orientation distribution in the thickness direction was determined by image analysis from optically sliced images. Fiber orientation angle and anisotropy were determined by the fast Fourier transform method, which holds advantages over the conventionally applied Hough transform with regard to evaluation of fiber width-weighted contribution and intrafiber segmental contribution. An orthogonally layered Japanese paper handmade by the flow-sheet forming method resulted in a clear change of fiber orientation angle from 0 ° to 90 °. Machine-made <b>wood-containing</b> printing <b>paper</b> showed the highest anisotropy, while copier paper showed a low anisotropy. Thick papers like the wood-free paperboard and recycled packaging board showed that the maximum measured thickness was about 150 μm. The depth limit to detect fluorescence was considered {{to depend on the}} apparent density of the paper and the light absorption character of the fibers.|$|R
40|$|Inorganic-organic sol-gel hybrid {{coatings}} can be {{used for}} improving and modifying properties of wood-based materials. By selecting a proper precursor, wood can be made water repellent, decay-, moisture- or UV-resistant. However, to control the barrier properties of sol-gel coatings on wood substrates against moisture uptake and weathering, an understanding of the surface morphology and chemistry of the deposited sol-gel coatings on wood substrates is needed. Mechanical pulp is used in production of <b>wood-containing</b> printing <b>papers.</b> The physical and chemical fiber surface characteristics, as created in the chosen mechanical pulp manufacturing process, {{play a key role in}} controlling the properties of the end-use product. A detailed understanding of how process parameters influence fiber surfaces can help improving cost-effectiveness of pulp and paper production. The current work focuses on physico-chemical characterization of modified wood-based materials with surface sensitive analytical tools. The overall objectives were, through advanced microscopy and chemical analysis techniques, (i) to collect versatile information about the surface structures of Norway spruce thermomechanical pulp fiber walls and understand how they are influenced by the selected chemical treatments, and (ii) to clarify the effect of various sol-gel coatings on surface structural and chemical properties of wood-based substrates. A special emphasis was on understanding the effect of sol-gel coatings on the water repellency of modified wood and paper surfaces. In the first part of the work, effects of chemical treatment on micro- and nano-scale surface structure of 1 st stage TMP latewood fibers from Norway spruce were investigated. The chemicals applied were buffered sodium oxalate and hydrochloric acid. The outer and the inner fiber wall layers of the untreated and chemically treated fibers were separately analyzed by light microscopy, atomic force microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The selected characterization methods enabled the demonstration of the effect of different treatments on the fiber surface structure, both visually and quantitatively. The outer fiber wall areas appeared as intact bands surrounding the fiber and they were clearly rougher than areas of exposed inner fiber wall. The roughness of the outer fiber wall areas increased most in the sodium oxalate treatment. The results indicated formation of more surface pores on the exposed inner fiber wall areas than on the corresponding outer fiber wall areas as a result of the chemical treatments. The hydrochloric acid treatment seemed to increase the surface porosity of the inner wall areas. In the second part of the work, three silane-based sol-gel hybrid coatings were selected in order to improve moisture resistance of wood and paper substrates. The coatings differed from each other in terms of having different alkyl (CH 3 –, CH 3 -(CH 2) 7 –) and fluorocarbon (CF 3 –) chains attached to the trialkoxysilane sol-gel precursor. The sol-gel coatings were deposited by a wet coating method, i. e. spraying or spreading by brush. The effect of solgel coatings on surface structural and chemical properties of wood-based substrates was studied by using advanced surface analyzing tools: atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion spectroscopy. The results show that the applied sol-gel coatings, deposited as thin films or particulate coatings, have different effects on surface characteristics of wood and wood-based materials. The coating which has a long hydrocarbon chain (CH 3 -(CH 2) 7 –) attached to the silane backbone (octyltriethoxysilane) produced the highest hydrophobicity for wood and wood-based materials...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three parts: Existing {{methods for}} characterisation of fibre crosssections have been improved, and new {{methods have been}} developed. These methods have then been applied to {{study the effects of}} wood characteristics and the pulping process on mechanical pulp fibres. Links have been established between fibre structure and paper properties such as surface smoothness and light scattering coefficient. New methods, based on SEM-images and image analysis, are described for providing cross-sectional fibre dimensions for large fibre populations, for wood tracheids (app. 60 000 tracheids in a wood trunk) and for processed pulp fibres (app. 1000 fibres per sample). The methods are suited e. g. for evaluation of changes in the fibre cross-sections from wood to the finished paper, or for mapping of fibre parameters within and between growth rings in a wood trunk. The treatment of data is discussed, showing how one may examine the changes in different groups of fibres (earlywood fibres, latewood fibres, split fibres) throughout a process. It is known from the literature that groundwood-based paper is superior to TMP-based paper with respect to printability. Fibres from SGW and PGW-pulp were found to be much more split in the longitudinal direction than TMP-fibres at comparable freeness. Intact groundwood fibres had thicker walls than intact TMP-fibres, but nevertheless super calendered hand sheets made from groundwood fibres were less roughened by moistening than were TMP-based sheets. Both for groundwood pulps and for TMPpulps, it was shown that reduced fibre wall thickness and increased fibre splitting was beneficial for improved surface smoothness and opacity. Latewood defibrate easier than earlywood during refining. In the case of grinding, there was no particular preference for earlywood or latewood to be defibrated. Reject refining of groundwood reject was, however, found to be very important for defibration of latewood-containing shives. Pulps made from a raw material with more compact fibres (high wall area to lumen area ratio) were found to defibrate easier, and contain less shives. It was found that refining tends to reduce wall thickness most on thickwalled parts of the fibre, thus causing a reduction of the wall thickness variation around the perimeter. Earlywood fibres were found to be preferentially split during refining. Most fibre splitting occurs during the primary stage, while the fibres are firmly attached to chips or fibre bundles. Latewood fibre wall thickness decreases considerably more than earlywood fibre wall thickness during refining. It seems that choosing an appropriate raw material is more effective than using excessive energy on reducing the wall thickness of thickwalled fibres. Earlywood fibres became more flattened during refining compared to latewood fibres, possibly due to repeated compressions and relaxations in the refiner. The energy consumption to a given freeness was found to be considerably larger for Scots Pine than for Norway Spruce. However, the fibre transverse dimensions did not differ much between Norway Spruce and Scots Pine. Pine pulps were far less developed than spruce pulps at similar energy level. A possible explanation for the large energy consumption may be that redistribution of extractives at the fibre surface could reduce friction in the refiner. This hypothesis should be further explored. The results in this study improve the knowledge of which fibre parameters that matter for surface smoothness and opacity of <b>wood-containing</b> publication <b>paper.</b> Further, this study elucidates how important fibre parameters such as wall thickness and fibre splitting are altered during a refining process. The results may be utilized to identify possible ways of modifying the TMP-process in order to produce paper with improved surface smoothness and opacity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
