5|$|Minority {{ethnic groups}} include white Zimbabweans, {{who make up}} less than 1% of the total {{population}}.

The 2012 census lists the total <b>white</b> <b>population</b> at 28,782 (roughly 0.22% of the population), one-tenth of its 1975 estimated size. Most emigration has been to the United Kingdom (between 200,000 and 500,000 Britons are of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin), South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic <b>white</b> <b>population</b> than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic <b>white</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Coronary {{mortality}} rates amongst South Asian populations {{are higher than}} in <b>White</b> <b>populations</b> in the UK. The contribution of incidence and prognosis of coronary disease to the higher coronary {{mortality rates}} amongst South Asian populations is unknown. Incident coronary disease commonly presents as angina and non-fatal myocardial infarction rather than as fatal events. Aim: This thesis sought to investigate the incidence and prognosis of differing clinical presentations of coronary disease such as angina and myocardial infarction in South Asian compared to <b>White</b> <b>populations</b> in the UK. Methods: Four new prospective studies, one aetiologic (South Asian N= 580 initially healthy) and three prognostic (N= 2189 with suspected new-onset stable angina, N= 502 undergoing coronary angiography and N= 3037 with acute coronary syndromes) were examined, using multi-variate regression analyses. A systematic review and meta-analysis of these and previously published studies was performed. Results: • Incidence of angina was higher in South Asian than in White people in a healthy population, and angina was similarly valid in predicting a poor prognosis in both ethnic groups compared to those with no chest pain. • In those with chronic angina, South Asian patients {{did not have a}} higher future risk of myocardial infarction and death than White patients, but had a worse symptomatic prognosis following coronary revascularisation when compared to White patients. • South Asian patients had no worse a prognosis for mortality than White patients after myocardial infarction • On meta-analysis, incidence of fatal and non-fatal coronary disease was higher in South Asian <b>populations</b> compared to <b>White</b> <b>populations</b> whilst prognosis of coronary disease in South Asian populations was not worse than in <b>White</b> <b>populations.</b> Conclusions: Increased coronary mortality rates in South Asian populations compared to the <b>White</b> <b>populations</b> are due to the higher incidence of fatal and non-fatal coronary disease in South Asian people, as the prognosis of manifest coronary disease in South Asian people is not worse than in White people...|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million black people and 30,000 whites.

5|$|Hispanic Americans, also {{referred}} to as Latinos, served in all elements of the American armed forces in the war. They fought in every major American battle in the war.

5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{during the war}} despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure {{to pay for the}} expansion of the military and the air training scheme.

These sums, while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the <b>white</b> <b>population</b> of less than 70,000 that accounted for most of the colony's economic output.

5|$|The {{increasing}} demands {{placed on}} the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots {{and other forms of}} resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese.
