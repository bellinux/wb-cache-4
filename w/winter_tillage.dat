50|$|In 1927, {{a drought}} {{shortened}} the harvest in southern {{areas of the}} Ukraine and North Caucasus. In 1927-28 the <b>winter</b> <b>tillage</b> area was badly affected due to low snow levels. Despite seed aid from the State, many affected areas were not re-sown. The 1928 harvest was affected by drought {{in most of the}} grain producing areas of Ukraine. Shortages in the harvest and difficulties with the supply system invoked difficulties with the food supply in urban areas and destabilized the food supply situation in the USSR in general. In order to alleviate the situation, a system of food rationing was implemented {{in the second quarter of}} 1928 initially in Odessa, and later spread to Mariupol, Kherson, Kiev, Dniprelstan (Dnipropetrovsk), and Kharkiv. At the beginning of 1929 a similar system was implemented throughout the USSR. Despite the aid from the Soviet Ukrainian and the Central governments, many southern rural areas registered occurrences of malnutrition and in some cases hunger and starvation (the affected areas and thus the amount of required food aid was under-accounted by authorities). Due to the shortage of forage livestock, its numbers were also affected (see table below).Most of kolkhozes and recently refurnished sovkhozes went through these years with few losses, and some were even able to provide assistance to peasants in the more affected areas (seed and grain for food).|$|E

40|$|Field {{studies on}} tillage and residue {{management}} for spring corn were conducted at two sites, in Tunliu (1987 - 1990), and Shouyang (1992 - 1995) counties of Shanxi province in the semihumid arid regions of northern China. This paper discusses {{the effects of}} different fall <b>tillage</b> (<b>winter</b> fallow <b>tillage)</b> and residue application methods on soil water profile with time and water use, as well as corn yields. Conservation tillage practices for corn in Shouyang resulted in significantly higher soil water contents, especially in the 0 - 100 cm profiles during April-July and September, than under conventional tillage, providing more available water for corn growth due to increased soil water storage during the rainy season. Conservation tillage with residue application practices generally led to yield advantages. Increases of 18 - 26 % were found for reduced tillage with residue incorporation over the conventional systems. Yields under no-till were equivalent to those from conventional methods, especially in dry years. These {{results suggest that the}} following two alternatives -both reducing the number of secondary tillage passes after the main operation for spring corn production systems: - using deep ploughing with incorporated straw and fertilizers after harvest in fall, and no-till seeding practices - using subsoiling between rows or no-till with residue mulching after harvest in fall, and no-till seeding practices...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} conventional technology and the technology of direct seeding at different doses of mineral fertilizers on the growth, development, productivity and economic efficiency of winter wheat cultivation on the leached black soil of the Central Caucasus.

It is caused by excessive seal of leached black soil, which was used in the study. Such a density of addition of black soils adversely affects the growth, development and yield of crops. As a result, the yield of winter wheat on the technology of direct seeding without fertilizers was 2. 46 t / ha, which was significantly lower than for conventional technology, which received 3. 21 t / ha.

Commonly, their suppression is realized by using conventional tillage, but that it has been demonstrated to damage the soil structure, which directly impacts the soil water content. The proposed alternatives vary in terms of date, depth and type of tillage. As the soil water content is a major factor in agriculture, it is essential to better understand the influence of the cover crop management on its spatio-temporal distribution. Recent studies demonstrated the relevancy of the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to estimate the three-dimensional soil water content distribution. However, only a few of them were performed under field conditions. This study aims at (i) validating the use of the ERT method to estimate the soil water content distribution under field conditions (ii) quantifying the influence of cover crop management on the dynamic of soil water content along the growing season of a maize crop and on Belgian soil types. Three types of cover crop management content will be daily monitored: strip tillage, spring tillage and <b>winter</b> <b>tillage.</b> In order {{to assess the impact of}} plants on the soil water distribution, an additional plot will be burned after <b>winter</b> <b>tillage.</b> ERT will be used on a surface of 2 mÂ² for each cover crop management.

40|$|Adapted {{agricultural}} soil management practices can enhance soil health by providing improved aggregate stability and soil structural quality. Hence water infiltration may be improved and plant water availability increased. In this study, {{we aim at}} quantifying the effect of tillage practices on the water dynamics in a loamy soil under temperate climate (Gembloux, Belgium). Therefore, we evaluated the ability of electrical resistivity tomography to estimate the water content at the field scale and under complex field conditions: varying pore water conductivity, rainfall, crop water uptake, root growth, varying temperature and changing soil structure due to tillage practices. During the summer of 2015, we studied four different treatments: conventional spring and <b>winter</b> <b>tillage,</b> strip tillage and a bare soil. We used ERT to estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of soil moisture. In each of the plots, 2 time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probes and 2 suction cups were installed. A calibration trench was constructed with 4 electrodes, 1 TDR probe and 1 temperature sensor at 4 different depths. We quantified changes of porosity over the growing season using X-ray tomography.

40|$|Wind {{erosion and}} blowing dust are major {{problems}} for traditional <b>tillage</b> <b>winter</b> wheat-summer fallow in eastern Washington. Wind erosion reduces soil productivity and dust particulates {{are a major}} air quality concern. Conservation tillage summer fallow can reduce wind erosion markedly, but is used by relatively few farmers in the low-precipitation (less than 12 inch/year) region of the Inland Pacific Northwest. Barriers to adoption include the cost of conservation tillage implements and reluctance to change "tried and proven"traditional tillage methods. This bulletin compares economic results for the V-sweep undercutter and traditional fallow tillage systems on a case study farm located near Ritzville, WA. The farmâs eight-year average wheat yield is 46 bu/ac. Grain yields are similar for the two systems. This study shows that the undercutter method of summer fallow farming is more profitable than the traditional system on the case study farm due to slightly lower production costs.

Hence, comprehensive studies investigating the effects of local management and landscape composition on the provision of and trade-offs between multiple ESs are urgently needed. We explored the effects of conservation tillage, nitrogen fertilization and landscape composition on six ESs (crop production, disease control, soil fertility, water quality regulation, weed and pest control) in <b>winter</b> cereals. Conservation <b>tillage</b> enhanced soil fertility and pest control, decreased water quality regulation and weed control, without affecting crop production and disease control. Fertilization only influenced crop production by increasing grain yield. Landscape intensification reduced the provision of disease and pest control. We also found tillage and landscape composition to interactively affect water quality regulation and weed control. Under N fertilization, conventional tillage resulted in more trade-offs between ESs than conservation tillage. Our results demonstrate that soil management and landscape composition affect the provision of several ESs and that soil management potentially shapes the trade-offs between them.

40|$|Abstract: Integrating {{livestock}} {{with cotton}} (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) rotations offers profitable alternatives for {{producers in the}} southeastern USA, but could result in excessive soil compaction, which can severely limit yields. A 2 year field study was conducted at two locations (both Plinthic Paleudults) in south Alabama to develop a conservation tillage system for integrating cotton and peanut production with winter annual grazing of stocker cattle under dryland conditions. <b>Winter</b> pasture and <b>tillage</b> were evaluated in a strip plot design with four replications. Winter pastures (main plots) were oat (Avena sativa L.) and ryegrass (Lolium mutiflorum L.). Tillage systems (subplots) included: 1) mouldboard plough + disking, 2) in-row subsoiling with a KMC subsoiler + disking, 3) no-till with KMCTM subsoiling, 4) paratill + disking, 5) no-till with paratilling 6) strict no-till, 7) disking, and 8) chisel plough + disking. We evaluated soil strength, seed cotton, and peanut yield. Soil compaction was increased by grazing to the 10 - 15 -cm depth but conventional tillage or conservation tillage with non-inversion deep tillage alleviated this problem. Forage species did not affect cotton yields. However, peanut yields were 13 % greater with oat than with ryegrass.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A 2 âyear {{rotation}} of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) âsummer fallow is a dominant cropping {{system in the}} dryland region of the Pacific Northwest United States. Traditional, tillageâbased summer fallow relies on a soil mulch to disrupt capillary continuity to conserve seedâzone water for early establishment of <b>winter</b> wheat. However, <b>tillage</b> to create the soil mulch and to subsequently fertilize and control weeds often results in unacceptable levels of wind erosion due to the burial of crop residues and the exposure of fine soil particles. Chemical (noâtill) fallow (CF) and reducedâtillage fallow (RT) are two alternatives for reducing wind erosion. Our objectives were: (i) to assess the effects of CF and RT on seed â and rootâzone temperature and water regimes; and (ii) to test the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model for simulating management effects on soil temperature and water. Weather data, soil temperature, and water content were monitored in paired CF and RT treatments during April 2003 âMarch 2004. The RT treatment was observed to retain more seedâzone water over summer compared to CF, consistent with relevant literature for Mediterranean environments and of critical importance to farmers. During the wet winter, CF gained more water than RT because of later planting of winter wheat, and thus less water use. Observed soil temperatures {{were higher in the}} CF due to its lower dry soil albedo, higher bulk density and thermal diffusivity than in the RT. SHAWâsimulated water contents followed the general trend of the field data, though it slightly underâpredicted soil water content for CF and overâpredicted for RT. SHAW underâpredicted soil temperature during the dry summer and overâpredicted for the wet (NovemberâDecember) period yet the overall trend was properly described wit...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY â There are {{changes in}} the physical, {{chemical}} and biological properties of the soil, when direct drilling is adopted. This presentation reports experimental results for soil fertility and the response of crops to fertilizers under direct drilling {{in the south of}} Portugal. The increase of soil organic matter content, that usually occurs under no tillage, seems to be the only effective way to overcome the poor nitrogen-use efficiency of winter cereals under Mediterranean conditions. The normal organic matter content of the soil in the region is only about 1 %. For this level of organic matter, the results indicate that the most economical nitrogen application would be 160 kg N/ha and the correspondent yield would be 3063 kg wheat/ha. However, for an organic matter content of 3 % the most economical nitrogen level would be only 37 kg N/ha and the corresponding yield 3862 kg/ha. The application of fertilizers to the soil surface under direct drilling can increase soil acidity of the top-most layer. However, the experimental results show that this effect is temporary and the increase in soil organic matter offsets this effect on pH. The soils under direct drilling develop a very steep gradient in the concentration of nutrient, especially those less mobile in the soil, such as phosphorus. Experimental results suggest that this is one beneficial effect of direct drilling. Another significant interaction between tillage and fertilization is the importance of the timing of the first nitrogen topdressing application (at tillering stage) especially during wet <b>winters.</b> Under conventional <b>tillage</b> systems this can be delayed because of the inability to get onto the land with farm machinery under wet conditions. Experimental results will be presented that quantify this effect...|$|R
40|$|In two {{organically}} cultivated field trials, {{located in}} Germany and Greece, effects of reduced primary tillage systems on root and shoot growth of cereals were investigated. The field trial in Rommersheim near Mainz, Germany, {{was established in}} 1994. A similar experiment was established in 1995 located in Athens, Greece. Mouldboard plough, two-layer plough and layer cultivator were used in Germany. Mouldboard plough, rotary hoe and zero tillage were applied in Greece. The field experiment in Germany was performed on a clay loam soil with a 5 -year crop rotation (green fallow, winter wheat/catch crop, peas, winter rye/catch crop, spring barley) in a split-plot design. The investigated crop was spring barley and <b>winter</b> rye. <b>Tillage</b> systems were implemented after cereal harvests only. The field experiment in Greece was performed on a clay loam soil with a 3 -year crop rotation (cereal, green manure, cotton) and a split-plot design. The test crop was winter wheat. The parameters measured in both field trials were soil physical and chemical parameters, as well as root and shoot parameters of the cereals. In Germany higher tillage intensity implemented on spring barley on one hand reduced aggregate stability and decreased the penetration resistant, especially in lower depths. On the other hand, it increased rooting density, nutrient uptake and crop development. Dry matter production of weeds was significantly lower in the ploughed fields compared with those treated with the cultivator. Correspondingly, higher grain yields were positively correlated with tillage intensity. Positive effects of the cultivator on soil properties (e. g. significant higher aggregate stability compared to ploughing) became less significant. The two-layer plough used in Germany combines the effects of turning and mixing the soil in the upper plough depth, while loosening the soil in the deeper plough layer, resulting in a good soil structure. The differences between the tillage systems in the parameters measured became less when they were releated to the winter rye. This fact {{was due to the}} lack of tillage before the seeding of the crop. In the experiment field of Athens, under minimum and zero tillage, it was found that root and shoot parameters were significantly higher than those of ploughed plots. Physical and chemical soil properties were also improved compared to those of ploughed soil. Yields were found to be significantly correlated to the root parameters and the soil properties, and this was confirmed by the significant yield increase observed under minimum tillage. Concluding the results show that under conditions of temperate humid climate sufficient control of weed and optimized nutrient management in organic farming can only be ensured by turning and mixing the soil. Thus, a general renunciation of ploughing cannot be suggested. Under conditions of primary tillage becomes more important for the main soil properties and more Mediterranean climate and limited soil water availability, reduced profitable in the long term...|$|R
