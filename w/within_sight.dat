5|$|Roosevelt's {{death was}} met with shock and grief across the U.S. and around the world. His declining health had not been known to the general public.

5|$|An Itza {{account of}} this {{encounter}} reached the colonial authorities in Yucatán via Tipuj. The Itza reported that the Guatemalan party approached on horseback to <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of Nojpetén, and about thirty curious Itzas gathered {{to talk to the}} intruders, whereupon they were attacked by the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of thirty Itzas, the capture of one and yet more wounded. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-Chunjujub', Yucatán, was in Nojpetén around this time, and reported that the Itza gathered 3,000–4,000 warriors ready to repulse Díaz de Velasco's party.|$|E

50|$|Originally, signals {{displayed}} simple stop/proceed indications. As {{traffic density}} increased, this {{proved to be}} too limiting and refinements were added. One such refinement was the addition of distant signals on the approach to stop signals. The distant signal gave the driver warning that he was approaching a signal which might require a stop. This allowed for an overall increase in speed, since train drivers {{no longer had to}} drive at a speed <b>within</b> <b>sighting</b> distance of the stop signal.|$|R

His body now rests in the Bomana Cemetery, Port Moresby, and his Victoria Cross is on display at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. The Melbourne suburb of Kingsbury was named in his honour, as was a rest area on the Remembrance Driveway and a street in the Canberra suburb of Gowrie. Kingsbury's story was featured in the History Channel production For Valour.|$|E
5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of the pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{served as}} a {{military}} adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at Decelea, just over ten miles (16km) from Athens and <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of the city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely {{from their homes and}} crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with Athens in Attica. The move was devastating to Athens and forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.|$|E

5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of their home. He saw {{two people in}} a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Desiring {{to return}} to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. <b>Within</b> <b>sight</b> of the U.S. border, he steadfastly refused to seek a pardon, {{although}} 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council instructed the state's congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge {{to return to}} the U.S. prior to the pardon being issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated in {{his efforts}} to {{intercept}} the convoy at anchor, Willaumez determined to meet it at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There he waited for the convoy, seizing any ships that came <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position. For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E
5|$|However, Red Army {{resistance}} {{had slowed}} the Wehrmacht. When, on 10 October the Germans arrived <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of the Mozhaisk line west of Moscow, they encountered another defensive barrier manned by new Soviet forces. That same day, Georgy Zhukov, {{who had been}} recalled from the Leningrad Front on 6 October, took charge of Moscow's defense and the combined Western and Reserve Fronts, with Colonel General Ivan Konev as his deputy. On 12 October, he ordered the concentration of all available forces on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by Vasilevsky. The Luftwaffe still controlled the sky wherever it appeared, and Stuka and bomber groups flew 537 sorties, destroying some 440 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|In March 1695, Captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars. The Spanish pressed ahead to Lake Petén Itzá and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties. At the lakeshore, <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of Nojpetén, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. Interrogation of an Itza prisoner revealed that the Itza kingdom {{was in a state of}} high alert to repel the Spanish; the expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.|$|E

5|$|In the south, the Second Panzer Army {{initially}} advanced towards Tula {{with relative}} ease because the Mozhaisk defense line {{did not extend}} that far south and no significant concentrations of Soviet troops blocked their advance. However bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges eventually slowed the German army, and Guderian did not reach the outskirts of Tula until 26 October. The German plan initially called for the rapid capture of Tula, followed by a pincer move around Moscow. The first attack, however, was repelled by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers on 29 October, after a fight <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of the city. On 31 October, the German Army high command ordered a halt to all offensive operations until increasingly severe logistical problems were resolved and the rasputitsa subsided.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, the Terra Nova {{arrived at}} the {{beginning}} of February, and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered. When Atkinson belatedly left for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he encountered the scurvy-ridden Edward ("Teddy") Evans who needed urgent medical attention. Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to send the short-sighted Cherry-Garrard on 25 February, who was not able to navigate, only as far as One Ton depot (which is <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> of Mount Erebus), effectively cancelling Scott's orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March.|$|E

The cortege began the 45-minute journey just after 6:00pm EST, with the Reagan family following in limousines. Military units escorted the caisson as it {{made its way to}} the sounds of muffled drums. Behind the caisson was a riderless horse named Sergeant York, carrying Reagan's riding boots reversed in the stirrups.

In a raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914, the town was shelled by the German battlecruisers Von der Tann and Derfflinger. In the final assault on the Yorkshire coast the ships aimed their guns at the signal post {{on the end of the}} headland. Whitby Abbey sustained considerable damage in the attack which lasted ten minutes. The German squadron responsible for the strike escaped despite attempts made by the Royal Navy.|$|E

For their services, Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope. There they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France.
