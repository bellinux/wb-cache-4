She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends. Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with the shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.|$|E
25|$|Charvaka {{believed}} that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with sensual pleasure. Since {{it is impossible to}} have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to be foolish.|$|E
25|$|On January 11, 1962, the Jewish Community Council stated it opposed {{public schools}} having {{celebrations}} of religious holidays such as Christmas. In response, Rabbi Frank {{wrote a letter}} to the editor of The Washington Post saying there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with a public school having a celebration of Christmas together with a celebration of Hanukkah. Rabbi Frank wrote that such religious holiday celebrations were a way to teach children to respect others' religion.|$|E

25|$|In May 1964, Chiume {{looked forward}} to Malawi being {{organised}} with no opposition at all and claimed that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with dictatorship. Banda went further in saying that any government chosen by the people themselves was not a dictatorship. By the time {{that many of the}} ministers had concerns about the reintroduction of Preventive Detention in July 1964, the possibility of reasoned opposition to Banda was long past. The Cabinet Crisis did not therefore represent any change in the nature of MCP, merely that, as external enemies had been subdued, its leader made enemies of the party's own long term members.|$|E
25|$|Hirschfeld {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the Harden–Eulenburg affair of 1906-09, which turned to be the most explosive sex scandal of Imperial Germany. During the libel trial in 1907 when General Kuno von Moltke sued the journalist Maximilian Harden after the latter had run an article accusing Moltke of having a homosexual relationship with the politically powerful Prince Philipp von Eulenburg, who was the Kaiser's best friend, Hirschfeld testified for Harden. Hirschfeld in his role as an expert witness testified that Moltke was gay, and thus what Harden had written was true. The homosexual Hirschfeld — who passionately wanted to make homosexuality legal in Germany — believed that proving that Army officers like Moltke were gay would help his case for legalization, and as such he also testified that he believed there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with Moltke.|$|E
500|$|On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. [...] Officially {{known as}} the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy, she acted as a {{coordinator}} for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government. [...] Her position was sometimes informally described as the [...] "Energy Czar" [...] or the [...] "Climate Czar". [...] It did not require Senate confirmation. Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress, but the Obama transition team said there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with it. In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: [...] "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation." ...|$|E

500|$|Reed {{attended}} Howard University in Washington, D.C., {{graduating in}} 1991 {{with a degree}} in political science. Students took over the Howard administration building in 1989, protesting having Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater on the university's board of trustees, saying that he had contributed to [...] "growing anti-black sentiment in America" [...] through his management of President George H. W. Bush's campaign. Atwater resigned from the board. Reed disagreed with their action, saying there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with having the Republican Party try to win the votes of black students. He felt {{it would have been better}} if Atwater had met with the protesting students, as he might have learned more about their position. For instance, [...] " [...] might have gained insight into a generation of students portrayed as destitute and in need of more federal support." [...] Reed noted [...] "that 85 percent of Howard's 12,000 students receive federal aid." ...|$|E
500|$|While in Germany, Sutcliffe began {{experiencing}} severe {{headaches and}} acute sensitivity to light, and Kirchherr stated {{that some of}} the headaches left him temporarily blind. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, but they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. They suggested he go back to Britain and have himself checked into a hospital with better facilities, but Sutcliffe was told there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with him, so he returned to Hamburg. While living at the Kirchherrs' house his condition got worse, and after collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to hospital by Kirchherr (who rode with him in the ambulance), but he died before the ambulance reached the hospital. The cause of death was revealed to have been a cerebral haemorrhage, specifically, a ruptured aneurysm resulting in [...] "cerebral paralysis due to bleeding into the right ventricle of the brain." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{aired on}} Thanksgiving Day 1983, {{a year after}} Lee's final {{appearance}} as Mr. Hooper at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. [...] The producers chose to air it {{the first week of}} the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it. [...] The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. [...] Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. [...] Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, [...] "When we finished that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears", even Spinney underneath his costume. [...] Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although Spinney later said, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with that take. [...] It was perfect". [...] Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Profusion" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Paoletta from Billboard described the song as a [...] "sparse number" [...] {{and said that}} it was a [...] "good fit" [...] for the radio. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "lovely". Ian Youngs of BBC News commented that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] is one of the highlights from the album, with layers of dance beats and acoustic guitar that made it a more complete song. A writer for Daily Record described it as a [...] "stunningly beautiful ballad" [...] and considered it as one of the many highlights from American Life. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it [...] "dull" [...] and wrote that [...] "it was reinvented into a vibrant piece of guitar-driven pop-rock by Ray Carroll." [...] Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone deduced that with lyrics like [...] "I got you under my skin", Madonna conveyed the theme of gaining transcendence through detachment, [...] "but finally American Life comes across as defeatist more than anything else". Dan Aquilante from New York Post was dismissive of the track, saying that although there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with the guitar-driven composition of the track, it was not different from the strings and orchestration of other tracks from American Life, like [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] or [...] "Easy Ride". Robert Hilburn, while reviewing American Life for The Press of Atlantic City, listed the track as one of the songs that could [...] "save" [...] the album from being a [...] "profound fail". Ross Raihala, writing for The Olympian listed the track as a standout on American Life, in contrast to the [...] "dreary, directionless dance numbers and plodding ballads" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|Fender {{completed}} the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey {{finished third in}} the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. Wisden described the team's success as [...] "nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled more than his share of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. Wisden said: [...] "Essentially a change bowler —the best in England, as he has been aptly described—he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace. Wisden praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: [...] "Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault." [...] During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with his eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than plain glass. The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against Hampshire. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against Leicestershire and 137 in 90 minutes against Kent. There were no Tests in 1922, but Sydney Pardon wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with Lord Harris over the qualification of Alfred Jeacocke to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent, had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{opposition}} to changing the flag came from various sides, including from Confederate historical {{groups like the}} United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). Opponents to a change of the flag stated that incorporating the Confederate battle flag into the design would be too sectionalist, counterproductive, and divisive, saying that people should show patriotism towards the United States rather than the defunct Confederacy, referring to the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance, which states that the U.S. was [...] "one nation" [...] and [...] "indivisible". Opponents to the flag's change also said that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> with the 1920 flag and that people were content with it.
