6000|$|... "One wouldn't {{believe that}} {{a man of his}} size and {{appearance}} could be so fond of women," [...] said Mr. Cuthbert. [...] "He's the greatest old lady-killer that ever breathed. For two cents he would have come <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and let a five thousand dollar commission go. Do you know Mrs. Shorter?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{inevitable}} {{third person}} <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> was Monsieur Villeray. Sitting {{at the window}} with a book in his hand--sometimes reading, sometimes looking at the garden with {{the eye of a}} fond horticulturist--he discovered a strange cat among his flower beds. Forgetful of every other consideration, the old gentleman hobbled out to drive away the intruder, and left us together.|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B Vaccine Safety Hearing Public health, {{including}} vaccine safety, {{is critically}} important to this Subcommittee. Our Subcommittee, which is today exercising its oversight responsibility for the Department of Human Health & Services, is committed to ensuring that our national immunization policies and programs are functioning properly. The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) and the Food & Drug Administration are the federal agencies primarily responsible for immunization policy and safety and will be sharing their expertise <b>with</b> <b>us</b> later <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> There {{is no doubt that}} immunizations have greatly improved the public health in our country. Smallpox has been eradicated and cases of polio, tetanus, and diphtheria are rare. Theses are great victories for our public health system. Unfortunately, however, and, tragically, the history of immunization shows that sometimes vaccinations injure a child instead of inoculating them. That is why Congress created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986, to compensate those who have been harmed by a vaccine...|$|R
60|$|October 6.--Charles and {{his friend}} Surtees left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "For all that," [...] he added, with an oath, [...] "and if he bursts by the wayside, he {{must bring}} <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to the treasure." ...|$|R
60|$|February 13.--Mr. Macintosh Mackay, {{minister}} of Laggan, breakfasted <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> This reverend gentleman is completing the Highland Dictionary,[130] and seems very competent for the task. He left {{in my hands}} some papers of Cluny Macpherson, concerning the affair of 1745, from which I have extracted {{an account of the}} battle of Clifton for Waverley. He has few prejudices (for a Highlander), and is a mild, well-mannered young man. We had much talk on Highland matters.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it, sir; I'm {{talking of}} Cristy. When her back's up, there isn't her equal in England for strong language. My gentleman has misbehaved himself {{in some way}} (since you were <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> sir); how, I don't quite understand. All I can tell you is, I've given him notice to quit. A clear loss of money to me every week, and Cristy's {{responsible}} for it. Yes, sir! I've been worked up to it by my girl. If Cristy's mother {{had asked me to}} get rid of a paying lodger, I should have told her to go to---- we won't say where, sir; you'll know where when you're married yourself. The upshot of it is that I have offended my gentleman, for the sake of my girl: which last is a luxury I can't afford, unless I let the rooms again. If you hear of a tenant, say what a good landlord I am, and what sweet pretty rooms I've got to let." ...|$|E
50|$|My God, I {{wish we had}} the 9th Australian Division <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> D-Day.—Major General Freddie de Guingand, Chief of Staff, Allied Land-force Headquarters Europe, 1944.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing like it," [...] {{said the}} constable, looking up. [...] "Your missus gave ’em to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> A little gravel on top, {{and there you}} are." ...|$|R
60|$|Obliged {{to give up}} writing to-day--read Pepys instead. The Scotts of Harden were to have dined, but sent an apology,--storm coming on. Russells left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to go to Haining.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] objected Queen Bee, [...] "if {{one of the}} {{children}} is ill, do you think Aunt Roger will like to have <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> and the post girl could take the jelly." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Tuesday {{it was so}} rough, {{and with}} the rain, we had an awful time getting along. We had gunnery drill Tuesday and more fleet {{maneuver}}s. The Macon came out about 1 pm Tues. to maneuver with the fleet and to enter Frisco <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The Macon {{came out in the}} storm not knowing that she would never get back to land. The Macon circled high above the fleet all the afternoon, and about 6 o'clock, radio messages began coming in that the Macon had had casualties and would have to land. The C.C. of the fleet radioed all ships in company with us to go at full speed for the wreckage. The crew abandoned it as soon as it hit the water, and all were saved except two. There were 83 men in the crew. The wreckage sank within a few minutes after it hit the water. We lingered around the spot where it sank looking for any parts which might be floating around. The search lights on all ships were combing the waters all through the night. The crew to the Macon were floating around in rubber floats and almost froze to death. I had to read about the Akron disaster, but this one I witnessed. The commander Clay had just been transferred to the Macon from this ship. This may contradict with the papers, but this is straight. There was an explosion in the tail and they could not control it." ...|$|E
40|$|I am very honored {{today to}} be visitor in this Indigenous Territory, and I {{would like to}} begin by thanking the Indigenous Nations of Saskatchewan {{for taking care of}} this {{beautiful}} land for so many generations. I would also like to say Meegwetch to the Elders who shared their powerful teachings <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning...</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Hunting, I think," [...] replied Edward; [...] "at {{least he}} left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{to join the}} Laird of Colmslie and his hounds. I have heard them baying in the glen all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do mine," [...] Matteo agreed. [...] "In addition, I am hungry, for {{the bread}} they gave <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> was not fit for dogs, {{although}} I {{had to eat}} it, as it was that or nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louis {{is remarkably}} fond of coming here," [...] said Elsie to Cora, {{who entered the}} room a few minutes later, [...] "but he {{did not come to}} see <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He only came to ask after Herr Winklemann." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All you anti-railroad fellers {{ought to}} get together," [...] Mr. Bascom suggested; [...] "you've got us terrified since your friend from Leith turned the light of {{publicity}} on <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I hear Ham Tooting's been in and made you an offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one thing, you old grumbler, it {{is quite}} certain he cannot do worse than you do. My jaws ache now with trying to eat the food you gave <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Another week {{and you would have}} starved the whole band to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] exclaimed {{the blue}} jay, [...] "we cannot be shot now, for we are stuffed. Indeed, two men fired several shots at <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but the bullets only ruffled our {{feathers}} and buried themselves in our stuffing. We do not fear men now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} stolen a march upon <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> my dear General," [...] said Lord Woodville; [...] "or {{you have not}} found your bed so much to your mind as I had hoped and you seemed to expect. How did you rest last night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|September 4.--Archie Swinton left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> early. I wrote {{from seven}} to half-past two; but, partly that I had five proof-sheets to correct, partly that like old John Fraser[335] [...] "I {{was not very}} cleever to-day." [...] I made out but a page and a half.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your friends {{may have}} {{something}} to say to you," [...] he muttered. [...] "If you think to stop our tongues, you're wrong--wrong, I tell you. The game's up for you, Wingate. The wires that are ruining <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> will be telling of your arrest to-night, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say not so," [...] {{cried the}} Marchioness. [...] "Our son, Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, is young, handsome, all {{that a girl}} could desire. After months of {{wandering}} he returns to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It is our dearest wish to see him married and established. We offer you his hand." ...|$|R
60|$|My son Charles left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to take {{possession}} of his situation in the Foreign Office. He has been very lucky. Correcting sheets, etc., took up the morning hours. I wrote three leaves before two o'clock. Day bitter cold--with snow, a strong contrast to the mild weather we had last week.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Blake owes you a rare candle, Merton,' said Bude, adding, 'A {{great deal}} may be done, or said, {{in a long}} walk by {{a young man with}} his advantages. And if you had not had your knife in him last night I do not think she would have {{accompanied}} <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to attend the ministrations of Father McColl. He preached in Gaelic.' ...|$|R
60|$|ROBERTS. Ye told <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> gentlemen, to go {{away and}} reconsider our position. We have reconsidered it; {{we are here to}} bring you the men's answer. [To ANTHONY.] Go ye back to London. We have nothing for you. By no jot or tittle do we abate our demands, nor will we until the whole of those demands are yielded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Hallett, here we are," [...] Lisle {{said the}} next morning, [...] "and thank God {{neither of us}} is touched, except perhaps by a few slugs. Of these, however, I dare say the surgeon will rid <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It {{has been a big}} affair and, if we live to a hundred years, we are not likely to go through such another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to make a disagreeable remark," [...] she announced. [...] "You look ten years older, sir, than you did when you left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to go to the Court. Do me a favor--come to the sideboard." [...] The lawyer having obeyed, she poured out a glass of wine. [...] "There is the remedy," [...] she resumed, [...] "when {{something}} has happened to worry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Even so!' said Charles. 'Charlotte {{says he is}} gone. [...] "Poor Mr. Thorndale left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> after a day {{of private}} conferences, in which he seems to have had no satisfaction, for his {{resolute}} dignity and determination to be agreeable all the evening were"--ahem--"were great. Mabel cannot get at any of the real reasons from Eveleen, though I think I could help her, but I can't tell you."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we thought}} you'd come to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but we turned out early and left Woolwich, {{the best of}} boys, to mind his sisters and came to you instead--as you see! For Lignum, he's tied so close now, and gets so little exercise, that a walk does him good. But what's the matter, George?" [...] asks Mrs. Bagnet, {{stopping}} in her cheerful talk. [...] "You don't look yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|August 7.--My niece Anne leaves <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> summoned {{back from}} one scene of {{distress}} to another. Her uncle, David Macculloch, is extremely ill--a paralytic stroke, I fancy. She is a charming girl, lady-like in thought and action, and very pleasant in society. We are to dine to-day with our neighbours at Gattonside. Meantime I will avail myself of my disposition to labour, and work instead of journalising.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] Abe said, [...] "ye had best look to yer guns, {{for they}} mean mischief; {{they must have}} been {{watching}} <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> when we started, but concluded that the ground was too level, and that we should have time to get into position before they could get up to us, besides we had all the advantage in the stockades at the station. There ain't no station this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Tyler," [...] he said, in {{his usual}} speech-making style, [...] "when our friend Ben told <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> about your having {{discovered}} Mr. Stubbs's brother, we sent out and got this collar for the monkey, and we take the greatest possible pride in presenting it to you; although, {{if it had been}} something that my Lilly could have made with her own fair fingers, I should have liked it better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The king {{then stood}} up and spoke. 'Much hast thou talked to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and greatly hast thou {{wondered}} that thou canst not see our God; but we expect that he will soon come to us. Thou wouldst frighten <b>us</b> <b>with</b> thy God, who is both blind and deaf, and cannot even move about without being carried; but now I expect it will be but a short time before he meets his fate: for turn your eyes towards the east,--behold our God advancing in great light.' ...|$|R
60|$|August 25.--Mr. Adolphus left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{after a very}} {{agreeable}} visit. We all dined at Dr. Brewster's. Met Sir John Wright, Miss Haig, etc. Slandered our neighbours, {{and were}} good company. Major John Scott there. I did a little more at the review to-day. But I cannot {{go on with the}} tale without I could speak a little Hindostanee--a small seasoning of curry-powder. Ferguson will do it if I can screw it out of him.|$|R
