5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|John's son George John, 2nd Earl Spencer {{inherited}} Althorp {{after his}} father's death in 1783. He served as Whig MP for Northampton from 1780 to 1782 and for Surrey from 1782 to 1783 before accepting {{the title of}} 2nd Earl Spencer. He was later Home Secretary from 1806 to 1807 under Lord Grenville in the Ministry of All the Talents. Extremely interested in literary pursuits, he developed {{one of the largest}} private libraries in Europe at Althorp. He was the instigator and first President of the Roxburghe Club (an exclusive bibliophilic club), founded in 1812, President of the Royal Institution from 1813 to 1827, and Commissioner of the Public Records in 1831, among other literary pursuits. In later life, his collecting habit had become an obsession, and he attempted to collect every volume ever published in Britain. Such was his desire to obtain as complete a collection as possible, that when Napoleon instigated the secularisation of religious houses in south Germany, Spencer used the local British agent and Benedictine monk, Alexander Horn to acquire many of their rare books and manuscripts. Althorp became a major cultural hub of England during his time; at one Christmas, the actor David Garrick, the historian Edward Gibbon, the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the painter Joshua Reynolds, among other artistic figures. attended a party there together. However, George John's spending became problematic for the Spencers, especially as at the time they <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> the impact of the agricultural depressions brought on by the Napoleonic Wars. By {{the time of his death}} in 1834 he had amassed a debt of £500,000, which he passed onto his son, John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, the U.S.Supreme Court upheld {{an order}} {{breaking}} up the American Tobacco Company's monopoly. The company was then divided into several smaller enterprises, of which only the British-American Tobacco Company remained in Duke's control. After his death in 1925, {{there was a great}} deal of controversy, and some historians suspect that some resentful Imperial Tobacco executives <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> some anger at Duke for having lost the Tobacco War between Duke's company and Imperial Tobacco.|$|E

The period between 1910 and 1930 marks a huge point in the great migration of African Americans from the South to New York. This point also marks an influx from downtown Manhattan neighborhoods where blacks <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> less welcome, to the Harlem area. The black population in Harlem peaked in 1950 with a 98% share of the population (population 233,000).|$|E

Madame Montour remained loyal to the British despite several attempts by the French to bring her over to their side. Historians note that this was remarkable considering the British colonial government sometimes went as long as a year without paying her for her services.|$|E

To signal their resentment, Hone Heke cut down the flagpole at Kororareka. Rather than address the problems, FitzRoy had the flagpole re-erected. Hone Heke cut it down again, four times altogether; by the fourth occasion the First New Zealand War, sometimes called the Flagstaff War or the Northern War, was well under way.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, Kalākaua {{died and}} his sister Liliuokalani assumed the throne. She came to power during an {{economic}} crisis precipitated {{in part by the}} McKinley Tariff. By rescinding the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, the new tariff eliminated the previous advantage Hawaiian exporters enjoyed in trade to U.S. markets. Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Liliuokalani proposed a lottery and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government. Her ministers and closest friends tried to dissuade her from pursuing the bills, and these controversial proposals were used against her in the looming constitutional crisis.|$|E

Madame Montour continued to have influence as a friend of the British, representing the Iroquois and other native peoples of the area. She was hospitable to the white men who were beginning to migrate into the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley.

25|$|Having {{covered all}} {{possible}} routes Hannibal could take {{to leave the}} plain, Fabius sat tight, observing the Carthaginian army but doing nothing to force a decisive engagement. With this strategy Fabius kept his army safe but his political position began to suffer in Rome. His staff and the Roman senate demanded swift action to crush Hannibal since the Carthaginians were already trapped. When L. Hostilius Mancinus, sent to scout the Numidians with 400 horsemen dared to engage the Carthaginians, he was killed and his entire force destroyed by the Carthaginian cavalry under Carthalo, prompting the Romans {{to stick to the}} waiting game for the time being. Fabius in the meantime had visited Rome to perform certain religious duties. The Roman landed rich <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> the pinch with Hannibal destroying their property, so defending his strategy was another reason for this visit.|$|E
500|$|Sources of {{information}} regarding {{victims of the}} Iroquois in New France are the writings of Jesuit priests; the state registry of parishes in Quebec, Trois-Rivieres, and Montreal; letters written by Marie Guyart (French: Mère Marie de l’Incarnation); and the writings of Samuel Champlain. However, the accuracy of these sources and reports varies. For instance, {{in the town of}} Trois-Rivieres, approximately one third of deaths attributed to the Iroquois are missing names. [...] According to Canadian historian John A. Dickinson, although the cruelty of the Iroquois was real, their threat was neither as constant nor terrible as the sources of the time represented, but they <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> under siege.|$|E

500|$|His health {{began to}} improve by May 1784, and he {{travelled}} to Oxford with Boswell on 5 May 1784. By July, many of Johnson's friends were either dead or gone; Boswell {{had left for}} Scotland and Hester Thrale had become engaged to Piozzi. With no one to visit, Johnson {{expressed a desire to}} die in London and arrived there on 16 November 1784. On 25 November 1784, he allowed Burney to visit him and expressed an interest to her that he should leave London; he soon left for Islington, to George Strahan's home. His final moments were filled with mental anguish and delusions; when his physician, Thomas Warren, visited and asked him if he <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> better, Johnson burst out with: [...] "No, Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death." ...|$|E

[...] Referring to Cambridge's lead at Hammersmith Bridge, their number seven Steve Fowler said [...] "we <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> good but we should have closed the door there and then. [...] We should have killed them on the bend." [...] Cambridge cox Probert conceded to his counterpart Liz Chick: [...] "she steered very well." [...] Oxford coach Gröbler stated: [...] "It was wonderful. [...] Both crews ... were very good [...] and so disciplined. [...] I like these university students."

[...] With a week to go, the Light Blue coach Thomson stated [...] "we took a day off yesterday because some of the crew <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> off-colour ... they appear to be suffering from some internal trouble".

500|$|Lionel Luthor {{is portrayed}} in the program by John Glover; Glover said he appreciates the [...] "clear canvas" [...] {{he had to work}} with when {{developing}} his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time. When portraying the character's struggle with terminal liver disease, Glover was inspired by a friend's battle with cancer; he said his friend was a [...] "cheerleader to people", who supported and boosted others when they <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> bad. When Glover's friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it, but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later. This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide—which Lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal.|$|E
500|$|The ROM {{image of}} {{the first version of}} Shadowrun {{contains}} a much more crude script, with more sexual suggestive and violent phrases. For example, one line is changed from [...] "morgue guys" [...] to [...] "chop shop guys". The game's distributor favored the less serious version for retail release, sparking indignation and conflict among Kidd and other members of Beam's staff. Kidd recalled: [...] "Beam Software was a madhouse, a cesspit of bad karma and evil vibes. The war was reaching shooting level; old school creators who just wanted to make good games were being crushed down by a wave of managerial bull. It was no longer a 'creative partnership' in any way; it was 'us' and 'them'. People <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> creatively and emotionally divorced from their projects." [...] Shadowrun was ultimately completed by its deadline. Kidd credits this to the staffers abstaining from company meetings and workshops, and continually keeping management away from the designers.|$|E

[...] In an interview with The Sun, Martin said, [...] "The line in this song 'Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost' is what the whole record came out of because we <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> {{down at the end of}} the last tour.
