5|$|The Texas Board of Professional Engineers {{announced}} in 2000 that the Aggie Bonfire met the requirements {{to be considered}} a complex construction project that should be regulated by state engineering laws.

5|$|The {{number of}} ready-use rounds is {{insufficient}} and the hoists are desperately slow. The 47mm guns, {{much more so}} than the large and medium-calibre guns, <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which needs to be corrected as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|As {{the regular}} sacrifices {{continue}} the islanders approach the king for help, {{as they are}} worried there will soon be no young girls left. The king again asks {{the advice of the}} spaeman, who tentatively suggests that the king's only daughter, Princess Gem-de-lovely, his most prized possession, <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be offered to the stoor worm to encourage it to leave. During the ten-week period of grace before the princess has to be sacrificed, messengers are despatched to every corner of the realm offering the kingdom, marriage to the princess, and the magic sword the king had inherited from the god Odin.|$|E

5|$|Bob Bishop confronts Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman), {{telling him}} that his {{daughter}} Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere) is trying to expose The Company and that they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take drastic measures. Claire is packing up her father's files, when her boyfriend West Rosen arrives to try and stop her from revealing his secret. Angered, she gives him his file and breaks up with him. Noah returns home and tells Claire not to expose The Company, informing her {{that he has made}} a deal. He will work for them and in exchange his family will be left alone to lead normal lives.|$|E
5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback since gamers <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play the entire game in one sitting {{if they wish to}} complete it. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison to games on the Mega Drive and Super NES (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Europe).|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the gang}} the Sole Survivor {{has been most}} {{neglecting}} will turn on them and take over the power plant of Nuka-World. With the remaining two gangs by their side, the Sole Survivor <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the rogue gang. Their actions ultimately decide who controls Nuka-World. In an alternate scenario, they are also given the option of ending raider influence by assassinating the leaders of each gang and their lieutenants, thereby returning control of Nuka-World to the traders who originally {{used it as a}} hub of commerce.|$|E

I again earnestly urge upon men of all classes in our city the necessity of sober, careful thought and the criminal folly of any precipitate action.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would {{have to decide whether}} freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, she <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
5|$|In the film, a {{pharmaceutical}} company {{has developed a}} suppressor of the mutant gene, provoking controversy in the mutant community. Magneto declares war on the humans and retrieves his own weapon: Phoenix, the resurrected former X-Man Jean Grey. A final battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood ensues, and Wolverine must accept {{that in order to}} stop Grey, he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill her.|$|E
5|$|Like {{in other}} {{games in the}} series, Sonic {{collects}} rings scattered throughout levels; contact with certain obstacles and enemies scatters them away, and Sonic dies if he touches an enemy without any rings. Unlike previous titles, Secret Rings does not feature a life counter or game over screen, but instead Sonic reappears at the last visited checkpoint after dying, although the player <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> restart a mission if they fail a specified objective. The game contains 100 missions (including boss battles) {{over the course of}} eight levels. New missions, cutscenes, and sometimes new levels are unlocked by completing missions. Successful missions earn Sonic experience points, which advance him levels.|$|E

Most people in town think his father is a hard ass, but Will's much more easygoing. Although he's done some dating amongst the locals, <b>Will</b> <b>has</b> yet <b>to</b> find the right woman for him, and is beginning to doubt if she'll ever come along.|$|R

However, misfortune strikes in the form of Colonel Marrable, the Captain's father, who swindles his son out of the fortune left him by his late mother. The impoverished Captain fears that he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return to India with his regiment; he and Mary, each unwilling to inflict poverty on the other, end their {{engagement}} by mutual consent and with mutual regret.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rachel (Lea Michele) {{realizes that}} some glee club members are faking their singing. She tells glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), complaining {{that she is}} {{doing most of the}} work, exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn (Cory Monteith), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck, Brittany (Heather Morris), and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week: each club member <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do solos, and each must choose a song that best represents their feelings.|$|E
5|$|Owen sneaks out {{to spend}} the night at Abby's. In the morning, the detective forces his way into Abby's {{apartment}} and finds her asleep, only to be distracted by Owen.
