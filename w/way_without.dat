5|$|A {{result of}} {{dysplasia}} is usually further investigated, such as {{by taking a}} cone biopsy, which may also remove the cancerous lesion. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to invasive cancer. Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this <b>way,</b> <b>without</b> having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.|$|E

This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find {{a different sort of}} gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} <b>way,</b> <b>without</b> taking his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E

5|$|John Elwood Shepherd, {{referred}} to more commonly as Elwood, is a 13-year-old pickpocket who joins up with powder hunters Gamma and Smith {{in an effort}} to resurrect his dead sister Sheryl Ann Shepherd. He is introduced in the first chapter of the series. His character is named after Gotee Records co-founder Joey Elwood, a real-life music producer whose name Kubo thought fit Elwood's character design perfectly. Elwood has great talent with throwing knives, and is ingenious in combat, but struggles to overcome his sidekick status and measure up to the abilities of his superhuman partners. Smith and Gamma both see Elwood as a younger version of Gamma, which fills Gamma with hope and pride, but also the fear that Elwood may turn to evil. This concern prompts Smith and Gamma to leave Elwood behind at Gemini Laboratory {{at the end of the}} manga, so that he can find his own <b>way</b> <b>without</b> Gamma's influence. Whether Elwood decides to follow the pair or not is left ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own <b>way,</b> <b>without</b> evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E
5|$|In 1097, the Crusader armies {{assembled}} at Constantinople having {{traveled in}} groups eastward through Europe. Alexios I, who had requested only some western knights {{to serve as}} mercenaries to help fight the Seljuk Turks, blockaded these armies {{in the city and}} would not permit them to leave until their leaders swore oaths promising to restore to the Empire any land formerly belonging to it that they might conquer on the way to Jerusalem. The Crusaders eventually swore these oaths, individually rather than as a group. In return, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The Crusaders were however exasperated by Byzantine tactics, such as negotiating the surrender of Nicaea from the Seljuks while it was still under siege by the Crusaders, who hoped to plunder it to help finance their journey. The Crusaders, feeling betrayed by Alexios, who was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor, continued on their <b>way</b> <b>without</b> Byzantine aid. In 1098, when Antioch had been captured after a long siege and the Crusaders were in turn themselves besieged in the city, Alexios marched out to meet them, but, hearing from Stephen of Blois that the situation was hopeless, he returned to Constantinople. The Crusaders, who had unexpectedly withstood the siege, believed Alexios had abandoned them and considered the Byzantines completely untrustworthy. Therefore, they regarded their oaths as invalidated.|$|E
