50|$|Creams are {{semi-solid}} emulsions {{of oil and}} water. They {{are divided}} into two types: oil-in-water (O/W) creams which are composed of small droplets of oil dispersed in a continuous phase, and water-in-oil (W/O) creams which are composed of small droplets of water dispersed in a continuous oily phase. Oil-in-water creams are more comfortable and cosmetically acceptable as they are less greasy and more easily washed off using water. Water-in-oil creams {{are more difficult to}} handle but many drugs which are incorporated into creams are hydrophobic and will be released more readily from a <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>cream</b> than an oil-in-water cream. Water-in-oil creams are also more moisturising as they provide an oily barrier which reduces water loss from the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin.|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for evaluating the delivery performance of topical semi-solid formulations. A thin and uniform layer of formulation was applied in facsimile to actual usage conditions by troweling the vehicle across a thin. circular copper template (200 [mu]m in thickness). Approximately 30 - 45 mg of an oil-in-water cream, a <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>cream</b> or an ointment, each containing a range of concentrations of minoxidil, were applied over human cadaver skin within a defined circular area of 1. 54 cm 2. The rates of permeation of minoxidil from these formulations were determined by finite dose diffusion experiments. For formulations containing 2 % minoxidil, the flux from the w/o cream tested was about 4 times higher than fluxes from the o/w cream and the ointment. Even though all w/o formulations were initially saturated with drug, the flux of minoxidil from these creams increased as the concentration of minoxidil was increased from 0. 5 % to 2 %. In contrast, the delivery rates from the o/w cream and the ointment {{did not appear to}} be dependent on the minoxidil concentration applied (0. 5 - 2 %). Under the operative experimental conditions, the percent coefficients of variation of flux of minoxidil from these formulations were less than 20 %. To achieve this low level of variability, the skin samples were all obtained from the same cadaver abdomen. If one assumes that the efficacy of a particular formulation is dependent on the ability of the drug to be released from the vehicle and diffuse through the skin, the studies show that the nature of the vehicle can profoundly affect delivery even when excess solid drug is present. They also indicate that reliable in vitro comparisons of drug delivery are possible as long as one performs the studies on skin samples taken from the same section of skin...|$|E

Intensive moisturization of the lesions and use of emollient oils have been recommended for the prevention and treatment of striae distensae rubra. The aim of this research was to formulate an emollient water-in-oil cosmetic cream containing argan oil, which may be helpful in the prevention or early treatment of striae distensae. Patients and methods: Sensory evaluation of the consistency, firmness, adhesiveness, oiliness, spreadability, and rapidity of penetration into the skin was evaluated by 22 volunteers using 10 -point scales for each descriptor. The instrumental characterization of the cream was performed using Brookfield® CT 3 Texture Analyzer. The cutaneous changes induced by the topical use of the cream were evaluated by assessing the thickness of the epidermis, hydration, and elasticity of the skin using DermaLab® Combo scanner. Results: Ultrasound measurements showed an improvement in the elasticity of the epidermis following the application of cream. The product was well tolerated and appreciated by the consumers in terms of its spreadability, penetration ability, and lack of stickiness. The values recorded for texture analysis were firmness 10. 16 ± 0. 15  mJ, adhesiveness 30. 94 ± 6. 87  g, consistency 1229. 50 ± 119. 78  g, spreadability 481. 50 ± 39  g, and stringiness 0. 56 ± 0. 09  mJ. Conclusion: A <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>cream</b> containing argan oil and emollient ingredients with appropriate physical characteristics was obtained. In vivo study of clinical efficacy revealed a positive effect on increasing the skin elasticity, suggesting that the cream may be helpful in the prevention or early treatment of striae distensae.

5000|$|Creams are semisolid dosage forms {{containing}} {{more than}} 20% water or volatile components and typically less than 50% hydrocarbons, waxes, or polyols as vehicles. [...] They may also contain {{one or more}} drug substances dissolved or dispersed in a suitable cream base. This term has traditionally been applied to semisolids that possess a relatively fluid consistency formulated as either <b>water-in-oil</b> (e.g., cold <b>cream)</b> or oil-in-water (e.g., fluocinolone acetonide cream) emulsions. However, more recently the term has been restricted to products consisting of oil-in-water emulsions or aqueous microcrystalline dispersions of long-chain fatty acids or alcohols that are water washable and more cosmetically and aesthetically acceptable. Creams {{can be used for}} administering drugs via the vaginal route (e.g., Triple Sulfa vaginal cream). Creams are also used to treat sun burns.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} {{interest}} in the potential use of topical drug delivery formulations has resulted in increased use of the skin as a vital port for drug delivery. Extensive {{research has been conducted}} in designing vehicles capable of delivering a desired amount of drug to a specific site, to produce the desired pharmacological response. Rooperol tetra-acetate is a lipophilic, cytotoxic drug with the potential for use in the treatment of solar keratosis. For effective pharmacological action, delivery of the drug to the epidermal/dermal junction of the skin is required. A study of the topical penetration properties of rooperol tetra-acetate from different topical bases, each possessing different physico-chemical properties, was performed. The assessment involved a comparison of the diffusion properties under occlusive and non occlusive conditions when the drug was formulated into a gel, Cetomacrogol Cream B. P. (oil-inwater), Simple Ointment B. P. and an extemporaneously prepared <b>water-in-oil</b> topical <b>cream.</b> The in vitro experiments were conducted using polydimethylsiloxane and rat membrane mounted in a Franz diffusion cell. The topical permeation kinetics of rooperol tetra-acetate were determined by exploring the release characteristics of the active ingredient from the vehicles formulated and the permeability properties of the drug through the membranes employed. Further studies involved investigating the utilization of supersaturated systems intended to increase the thermodynamic activity of the drug when formulated into a propylene glycol/water vehicle (with and without polymer). To measure the release of rooperol tetra-acetate into the skin from a topical base it was necessary to, firstly, develop a suitable quantitative method for the analysis of the active drug in the aqueous receptor phase of in vitro diffusion cells. The second stage of product development was the design of an effective delivery system to facilitate the release of the diffusant from its base. A high performance liquid chromatographic method was utilized for the identification and quantification of the active drug. As validation is an important aspect in the development and subsequent utilization of an analytical procedure, the developed HPLC technique was validated by determining the precision, accuracy, range, limit of quantitation and sensitivity of the system. Lastly, the stability of rooperol tetra-acetate at elevated temperatures was assessed and a stability profile of the drug was generated for the three-month period of analysis. The results obtained following chromatographic analysis of the receptor phase sampled during the diffusion experiments indicate that the gel and oil-in-water formulations most effectively promoted the diffusion of rooperol tetra-acetate across polydimethylsiloxane membrane. The water-in-oil system exhibited lower flux rates and the ointment showed the least drug release. Occlusion of the topical vehicle increased the diffusitivity of the permeant from all formulations analysed. The permeation assessment results of the supersaturated systems showed enhanced diffusion of rooperol tetra-acetate across polydimethylsiloxane and rat membrane. The high thermodynamic activity existing in supersaturated systems most effectively increased the driving force for drug diffusion resulting in enhanced percutaneous penetration of rooperol tetra-acetate beyond the release and transport limitations of saturated solutions. These results provide the basis on which an effective topical drug delivery vehicle may be designed for this new drug entity...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the exact time course of a photosensitizer in tumour and surrounding host tissue is fundamental for effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) and fluorescence-based diagnosis. In this study {{the time course of}} porphyrin fluorescence following topical application of 5 -aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) using different formulations, concentrations and incubation times has been measured in amelanotic melanomas (A-Mel- 3) (n = 54) grown in transparent dorsal skinfold chambers of Syrian golden hamsters and in human basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) (n = 40) in vivo. To simulate the accumulation of ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX (Pp IX), a three-compartment model has been developed and rate constants have been determined. The kinetics of both the A-Mel- 3 tumours and the BCCs show a significantly higher fluorescence intensity in tumour as compared to normal surrounding host tissue. Maximal fluorescence intensity in A-Mel- 3 tumours {{as a percentage of the}} reference standard used occurs 150 min post incubation (p. i.) using a 1, 3 or 10 % (vol.) ALA solution buffered to pH 7. 4 and 1 h incubation time. After a 4 h incubation time maximal fluorescence intensity in tumour is measured shortly p. i. A concentration of 10 % ALA does not increase the fluorescence intensity as compared to 3 % ALA following 4 h incubation, but either 3 or 10 % ALA yields a significantly higher fluorescence after 4 h incubation time as compared to 1 h. The fluorescence intensity following an 8 h incubation reaches its maximum directly p. i. for all concentrations and then decreases exponentially. The fluorescence intensity in the surrounding host tissue shows no statistically significant difference regarding concentration or incubation time. At least during the first hour p. i., the fluorescence intensity measured in the surrounding tissue is lower as compared to that in the tumour in all groups. 24 h after topical application hardly any fluorescence is detectable in tumour or surrounding host tissue in all experimental groups. Incubating human BCCs with a 20 % ALA <b>cream</b> (<b>water-in-oil</b> emulsion) or a 20 % ALA gel (containing 40 % dimethyl sulfoxide) for approximately 2 h yields a similar fluorescence intensity directly after incubation for either cream or gel. However, while yielding a maximum 120 min p. i. with cream, the fluorescence intensity increases for a longer time (about 2 - 3 h p. i.) and up to higher values using the gel formulation. In surrounding normal skin, cream as well as gel formulation yields a similar fluorescence intensity directly after incubation. Afterwards the fluorescence intensity decreases slowly using the cream whereas a further increase of the fluorescence intensity is measured in the normal skin with a maximum 240 min p. i. using the gel formulation. The results of the proposed three-compartment model indicate that the observed selectivity of accumulated porphyrins following topical application of ALA is mainly governed by an increased ALA penetration of the stratum corneum of the skin, an accelerated ALA uptake into the cell and a higher porphyrin formation in tumour as compared to normal skin tissue, but not by a reduced ferrocheletase activity...|$|R
