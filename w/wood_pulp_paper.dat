5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>paper</b> used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it really was a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E
25|$|While monitoring, {{regulations}} and action by concerned citizens, {{as well as}} improvements within the industry itself are limiting the worst abuses, papermaking continues to be of concern from an environmental perspective, due to its use of harsh chemicals, its need for large amounts of water, and the resulting contamination risks, as well as trees being used as {{the primary source of}} <b>wood</b> <b>pulp.</b> <b>Paper</b> made from other fibers, cotton being the most common, tends to be valued higher than wood-based paper.|$|E
2500|$|Pulp {{magazines}} or Pulp Fiction (often {{referred to}} as [...] "the pulps") were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the 1950s. The term pulp derives from the cheap <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>paper</b> on which the magazines were printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher quality paper were called [...] "glossies" [...] or [...] "slicks". The typical pulp magazine had 128 pages; it was [...] wide by [...] high, and [...] thick, with ragged, untrimmed edges.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the year}} 2000, several small {{independent}} publishers released magazines which published short fiction, either short stories or novel-length presentations, {{in the tradition}} of the pulp magazines of the early 20th century. These included Blood 'N Thunder, High Adventure and a short-lived magazine which revived the title Argosy. These specialist publications, printed in limited press runs, were pointedly not printed on the brittle, high-acid <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>paper</b> of the old publications and were not mass market publications targeted at a wide audience. In 2004, Lost Continent Library published Secret of the Amazon Queen by E.A. Guest, their first contribution to a [...] "New Pulp Era", featuring the hallmarks of pulp fiction for contemporary mature readers: violence, horror and sex. E.A. Guest was likened to a blend of pulp era icon Talbot Mundy and Stephen King by real-life explorer David Hatcher Childress.|$|E
2500|$|Diethylzinc is {{not limited}} to only being used in chemistry. Because of its high {{reactivity}} toward air, it was used in small quantities as a hypergolic or [...] "self igniting" [...] liquid rocket fuel—it ignites on contact with oxidizer, so the rocket motor need only contain a pump, without a spark source for ignition. Diethylzinc was also investigated by the United States Library of Congress as a potential means of mass deacidification of books printed on <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>paper.</b> Diethylzinc vapour would, in theory, neutralize acid residues in the paper, leaving slightly alkaline zinc oxide residues. Although initial results were promising, the project was abandoned. A variety of adverse results prevented the method's adoption. Most infamously, the final prototype suffered damage in a series of explosions from contact between trace amounts of diethylzinc and water vapor in the chamber. This led the authors of the study to humorously comment: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1909 the U.S. Post Office, in {{its effort}} to counter the effects of shrinkage, experimented with {{different}} paper, printing the next series of postage stamps on a bluish-paper reportedly consisting of a 35% rag stock used conjunction with the usual wood pulp (this percentage has been called into question by some analysts). When placed next to a stamp of ordinary <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>paper</b> and the reverse sides are inspected the difference in paper tone is readily apparent. This experimental paper was supposed to reduce shrinkage from the paper dampening involved in the wet-sheet printing process; but while it represented a marginal improvement over the 1908 issues, it did not solve shrinkage problem sufficiently and its use was discontinued after a brief period. The perforation gauge of this issue is again 12. Stamps printed on bluish paper have denominations that range from 1c through 15c and were sold only in Washington DC, so used examples on cover usually bear a Washington DC postmark. Consequently most of the issues from this series are scarce and generally expensive. The 1 and 2 cent stamps are the most affordable for collectors, for they were issued in larger quantities, approximately 3 million of each issue printed. The remaining denominations appeared in very limited quantities and are (sometimes very) valuable. Rarest of all are the 4-cent and 8-cent stamps, which, in fact, were never released for postal use; apparently, they reached the public in 1915 when the Post Office traded them to stamp dealers in exchange for rare issues missing from the Smithsonian Institution collection of U. S. stamps. The denominations of 7, 9, 11 and 12 cents do not occur on bluish paper. [...] ) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>pulp</b> for sack <b>paper</b> is {{made from}} {{softwood}} by the kraft process. The long fibers provides the paper its strength and is added wet strength chemicals to even further improve the strength. Both white and brown grades are made. Sack paper is then produced on a paper machine from the <b>wood</b> <b>pulp.</b> The <b>paper</b> is microcrepped to give porosity and elasticity. Microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink. This is causing the paper to elongate 4% in machine direction and 10% in cross direction before busting. Machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping. The paper may be coated with polyethylene (PE) to ensure an effective barrier against moisture, grease and bacteria. A paper sack can be made of several layers of sack paper depending on the toughness needed.|$|R
