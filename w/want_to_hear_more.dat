2500|$|Ratcliff {{has been}} {{critical}} of her character. In a 1987 interview she commented, [...] "Sue really annoys me sometimes because she's got no guts. I'd love to liven her up a bit, dress her in some of Angie's clothes, {{get her out of}} that cafe, set her up in a business of her own and allow her to make something of her life." [...] Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: [...] "I was under the impression she'd become more assertive. I had visions of a bunch of feminists walking into the cafe one day {{right in the middle of}} a typical Sue and Ali fight, and them asking her why she puts up with him. No doubt Sue would screw up her nose and ask: 'What do you mean?' But she'd think about it, <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> and gradually begin to change her ways to become stronger, more independent! I get cheesed off with Sue. She isn't me at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of your {{adventures in}} the Forest of Gugu, {{and how you}} were able to get those dear little monkeys to use in Dorothy's Surprise Cake." ...|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{the final}} verse states that there's {{a piece of}} food on the shelf, and that if the {{listener}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> verses, they have to sing it themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} mean enough," [...] she answered, [...] "to listen at the door, and I {{heard you talking}} of your father. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> about him. That is why I came in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more,</b> John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval. We {{begin to}} be {{interested}} in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, Jacques, good-night," [...] said Harry, as {{the latter}} rose at last to depart; [...] "I'm delighted {{to have had a}} talk with you. You must come back to-morrow. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> about your friend Redfeather. Where did you say you left him?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} to prove - {{he had done it}} all; the {{audience}} just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> and {{made it a point to}} shout for it as well."(Johann D'Souza, Inkpot.com, Singapore) ...|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{called it}} a [...] "fine story" [...] which Niland [...] "told well... Mr Niland's {{approach}} is honest as it is refreshing... one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> from him".|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more,</b> {{but they}} walked away and I {{was afraid to}} follow them," [...] {{continued}} Dora. [...] "I thought I had better tell you and perhaps you'd know what to do. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> worry mother or my aunt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And dead men, and war, and power, and responsibility," [...] said Cleever, {{under his}} breath. [...] "You won't have any sensations left at thirty, {{if you go}} on as you have done. But I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> tales - more tales!" [...] He seemed to forget that even subalterns might have engagements of their own.|$|E
6000|$|... "To Miss Edith? Yes, yes, of course," [...] Mr. Cowper declared, impatiently. [...] "When shall you be down again, {{my young}} friend?" [...] {{he went on}} earnestly. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of your experiences. I {{want you to tell}} me the whole thing over again. I should like to get a signed {{statement}} from you. There are several points in connection with what you say, which bear out a favorite theory of mine." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more.</b> I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{know what}} he looked like, how he spoke, how he {{compared}} with me in a thousand ways; but it was plain {{that she would not}} willingly be communicative about him; and, with a feeling of resentment, I gave her her way and suppressed my curiosity.|$|R
2500|$|On 2 March 2005, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad {{announced}} that his troops would leave Lebanon completely [...] "in {{the next few}} months". [...] Responding to the announcement, opposition leader Walid Jumblatt said that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> specifics from Damascus about any withdrawal: [...] "It's a nice gesture but 'next few months' is quite vague - we need a clear-cut timetable".|$|R
6000|$|Having {{heard so}} much I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more,</b> and {{addressing}} the woman I asked her why her child <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go. She answered me with a good-humoured laugh, [...] "'Tis all because she heard 'em talking about it last winter, and she'd never been, and I says to her, 'Never you mind, Marty, I'll take you there the next time I go to Salisbury.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You shouldn't {{say that}} to me, or I shall begin to think I have been too kind,' she answered, some of the archness of her manner returning. 'Now, I {{know what you mean}} to say in answer; but I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> at present; and {{whatever}} you do, don't fall into the mistake of supposing I have accepted you in any other sense than the way I say. If you don't like such a limitation you can go away. I dare say I shall get over it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A gaunt soldierly-looking {{young man}} with long lean legs in riding gaiters and a bandolier, who had {{hitherto}} not spoken, intervened now on his behalf in a note of confident authority. [...] "That's aw right," [...] he said. [...] "Give him a feed, Mr. Logan--from me. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of that story of his. We'll see his machine afterwards. If you ask me, I should say it's a remarkably interesting accident had dropped this gentleman here. I guess we requisition that flying-machine--if we find it--for local defence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But do not think," [...] she replied, rallying, [...] "that I am in {{the least}} shaken because I see that the {{difficulty}} is greater than I have looked for. Your simile of ants is not correct. Great things {{can be done by}} individuals. Voltaire and Rousseau revolutionized French thought from the top to the bottom. Why should not a great woman some day rise and exercise as great influence over her sex as these two Frenchmen did? But do not let us talk about that any more. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> about what you are doing. I have thought of you so much during the past year--it has all seemed so strange and so sad. Are you really working hard--I mean steadily and regularly?" ...|$|E
50|$|The Booknotes concept {{grew out}} of a one-off {{interview}} special with Neil Sheehan, author of A Bright Shining Lie, in September 1988. The interview itself resulted from Lamb having viewed a short commercial television interview with Sheehan and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more.</b> According <b>to</b> Lamb, a strong viewer response to the program led to the decision to start producing a weekly author interview program.|$|R
50|$|Intro5pect has a {{track on}} here, so I was already into it. They play a {{different}} {{version of a}} song off their A-F Records album that features their rapid drum machine beats with punk rock music. It's great. The other bands are No Erasers Allowed, Kill The Scientists and ESL. I really liked ESL's pop-punk tracks and found myself <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of them.|$|R
50|$|Gay's {{reputation}} blossomed {{when she}} was chosen to sing the Alexandra Waltz for Princess Alexandra during her 1959 visit to Australia. The Fairy Princess <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> so, by royal command, the teenager sang a selection of songs. Ultimately, this led to Gay being contracted to Brisbane's Channel 7 for 3 years, where she appeared in shows such as the multi-Logie-Award-winning Theatre Royal with George Wallace Jnr.|$|R
60|$|DONALD DOW CAMERON, in Milntown of Ashintilly, Strathardle, aged forty-four years, married; who being solemnly sworn, and purged {{of partial}} council, by Duncan Campbell, sworn {{interpreter}} aforesaid, and by him interrogate, Depones, That {{in the summer}} after he heard that a serjeant in Braemaar was amissing, whose name he thinks was Davidson, or something like that, Angus Cameron, a preceding witness, told the deponent {{that he had seen}} Duncan Clerk the panel, and another man along with him, shoot a man, like a gentleman or an officer, upon a hill in Braemaar: That upon this the deponent told the said Angus Cameron that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> any such stories, nor to have such a report raised of the country; and the deponent at the same time advised Angus to keep the thing secret, and to speak no more on the subject.

5000|$|The Tiny Mix Tapes {{review by}} Clifford Allen {{says about the}} 2012 reissue [...] "this wonderfully remastered and {{augmented}} early set is indispensable for fans of contemporary improvisation and those who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of Chicago’s creative music roots." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{released}} in 1994 to weak sales and generally apathetic or poor reviews. Jason Damas's AllMusic review has since claimed {{that this was an}} injustice and that [...] "if you liked the more rocking parts of Hotwired, and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more,</b> this is an extremely worthwhile place to go." [...] Trouserpress was contrastingly dismissive, called the album a [...] "soggy hodgepodge of lunkheaded rock, would-be hip-hop, blues, soulful backing vocals and chants" [...] and advised readers to [...] "flush it".|$|E
60|$|The words struck me, but I did {{not care}} to ask their meaning. Somehow I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> no <b>more</b> of Mavovo's prophecies.|$|R
5000|$|According to the New York City Investment Fund, [...] "Espuelas...spoke {{about the}} impact, {{similar to that}} of {{economic}} integration on European nations, that his business would have unifying Latin American people separated by national borders. A board member interrupted him. It was David Rockefeller, retired head of Chase Manhattan, brother of Nelson, and a longtime pillar-the pillar-of corporate involvement in New York City life. Rockefeller <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more.</b> He invited Espuelas to his office." ...|$|R

50|$|A {{reviewer}} of {{a recording}} summarized in 1967:Van Nuffel {{was a completely}} new name to me — a Belgian contemporary of Kodály who died in 1953 {{at the age of}} 70 — but I certainly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of his music: his setting … is in the traditional nineteenth-century idiom with a touch of modality suggesting certain passages in Puccini and early Vaughan Williams, but it is a powerful and moving piece, rising out of a brooding darkness to a big impassioned outburst, and dying away again.|$|E
5000|$|Sputnikmusic's {{contributor}} pizzamachine {{found the}} album {{to be the}} group's best effort to date, rating it three-and-a-half stars out of five and saying [...] "The girls of t.A.T.u have become veterans {{of this type of}} danceable, catchy, and fun, electropop rock ... “Waste Management” is filled with expected synths/keyboards and the occasional auto-tuned vocals - the end result is a consistent and surprisingly solid album". Bradley Stern from Muumuse gave a favorable remark, describing it as [...] "bittersweet" [...] and stating that he would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of the album.|$|E
5000|$|I don't know if it's because I've got cleaner {{living or}} not, {{but the sound}} that I hear in my head is cleaner now. There's always some {{harmonic}} distortion {{when you have an}} amplified sound, I mean if you had a pure electric guitar tone it would be pretty uninspiring, but I just started to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of the resonance of the wood and the metal of the instrument...Sometimes I think that with Earth, although there's not a lot going on because of the distortion and the saturation, it can be quite tiring. I wanted there to be space Hex, so the music breathes.|$|E

50|$|He {{knew how}} to get hold of college men. I will tell you the way to do it, and that is to place {{something}} before them which is tremendously difficult. He presented missions as a war of conquest and not as a mere wrecking expedition. It appealed to the strong college athletes and other fine spirits of the colleges because of its difficulty. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> about it. The number of interviews greatly multiplied.|$|R
