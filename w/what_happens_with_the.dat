Humanities and other non-mathematical-intensive fields have also much higher admission rates than classical university engineering, economics or medicine.

25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is similar to}} <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> green-beard effect, but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior {{have been found in}} hydrozoans, slime molds, yeast, and ants. An example is in side-blotch lizards, where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.|$|E
