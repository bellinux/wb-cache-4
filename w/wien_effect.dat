40|$|We {{predict the}} {{non-linear}} non-equilibrium response of a "magnetolyte", the Coulomb fluid of magnetic monopoles in spin ice. This involves {{an increase of}} the monopole density due to the second <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> [...] -a universal and robust enhancement for Coulomb systems in an external field [...] -which in turn speeds up the magnetization dynamics, manifest in a non-linear susceptibility. Along the way, we gain {{new insights into the}} AC version of the classic <b>Wien</b> <b>effect.</b> One striking discovery is that of a frequency window where the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> for magnetolyte and electrolyte are indistinguishable, with the former exhibiting perfect symmetry between the charges. In addition, we find a new low-frequency regime where the growing magnetization counteracts the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect.</b> We discuss for what parameters best to observe the AC <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> in Dy$_ 2 $Ti$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $.

40|$|A {{cooperative}} {{model of}} an excitable membrane is constructed and discussed. The model has at most two stable and one unstable steady states. It {{is closely related}} to the model of Blumenthal, Changeux and Lefever (J. Membrane Biol. 2 : 351, 1970), but it is simplified by the absence of equilibration layers. Transitions between the steady states can be brought about by changes in pH or by the <b>Wien</b> field-dissociation <b>effect...</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on {{data on the}} X-ray {{spectrum}} of the Coma cluster, interpreted as thermal bremsstrahlung, the expected brightness depletion from Compton scattering of the microwave background {{in the direction of}} the cluster is computed. The calculated depletion is about one-third that recently observed by Gull and Northover, and the discrepancy is discussed. In comparing the observed microwave depletion in the direction of other clusters which are X-ray sources it is found that there is no correlation with the cluster X-ray luminosity. Consequently, the microwave depletion observations cannot yet be taken as good evidence for a thermal bremsstrahlung origin for the X-ray emission. The perturbation from Compton scattering of photons on the high-frequency (Wien) tail of the blackbody distribution is computed and found to be much larger than predicted in previous calculations. In the <b>Wien</b> tail the <b>effect</b> is a relative increase in the blackbody intensity that is appreciably greater in magnitude than the depletion in the Rayleigh-Jeans domain...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of an {{analysis}} of nonlinear electrical effects in lipid bilayer membranes, the influence of the dissociation field (or <b>Wien)</b> <b>effect</b> on the membrane conductivity is investigated. It is shown that the theory of Onsager for the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> in a macroscopic phase can be applied to a thin membrane when the proper boundary conditions at the membrane-solution interface are introduced. It is assumed that an activation energy is associated {{with the passage of the}} ion across the interface. The mathematical treatment of the model is restricted to the case for which cations and anions have identical properties except for the charge sign. The resulting differential equations for the ion concentration within the membrane are integrated numerically. The analysis shows that the influence of the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> on the membrane conductivity is appreciable only if the energy barrier at the interface is sufficiently high, i. e. if the rate limiting step for the ion transport is the passage of the ion across the interface...|$|E
40|$|The Second <b>Wien</b> <b>Effect</b> {{describes}} the non-linear, non-equilibrium response of a weak electrolyte in moderate to high electric fields. Onsager’s 1934 electrodiffusion theory 1 along with various extensions 2, 3 has been invoked for systems and phenomena {{as diverse as}} solar cells 5, 6, surfactant solutions 7, water splitting reactions 8, 9, dielec-tric liquids 10, electrohydrodynamic flow 11, water and ice physics 12, electrical double layers 13, non-Ohmic conduction in semiconductors 14 and oxide glasses 15, biochemical nerve response 16 and magnetic monopoles in spin ice 17. In view of this technolog-ical importance and the experimental ubiquity of such phenomena, {{it is surprising that}} Onsager’s <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> has never been studied by numerical simulation. Here we present simulations of a lattice Coulomb gas, treating the widely applicable case of a double equilibrium for free charge generation. We obtain detailed characterisation of the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> and confirm the accuracy of the analytical theories as regards the field evolution of the free charge density and correlations. We also demonstrate that simulations can uncover further corrections, such as how the field-dependent conduc-tivity may be influenced by details of microscopic dynamics. We conclude that lattice simulation offers a powerful means by which to investigate system-specific corrections to the Onsager theory, and thus constitutes a valuable tool for detailed theoretical studies of the numerous practical applications of the Second <b>Wien</b> <b>Effect.</b> 1 a...|$|E
40|$|A non-Ohmic current {{that grows}} {{exponentially}} with the square root of applied electric field {{is well known}} from thermionic field emission (the Schottky effect) 1, electrolytes (the second <b>Wien</b> <b>effect)</b> 2 and semiconductors (the Poole–Frenkel effect) 3. It is a universal signature of the attractive Coulomb force between positive and negative electrical charges, which is revealed as the charges are driven in opposite directions {{by the force of}} an applied electric field. Here we apply thermal quenches 4 to spin ice 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 to prepare metastable populations of bound pairs of positive and negative emergent magnetic monopoles 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 at millikelvin temperatures. We find that the application of a magnetic field results in a universal exponential-root field growth of magnetic current, thus confirming the microscopic Coulomb force between the magnetic monopole quasiparticles and establishing a magnetic analogue of the Poole–Frenkel effect. At temperatures above 300 [*]mK, gradual restoration of kinetic monopole equilibria causes the non-Ohmic current to smoothly evolve into the high-field <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> 2 for magnetic monopoles, as confirmed by comparison to a recent and rigorous theory of the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> in spin ice 17, 18. Our results extend the universality of the exponential-root field form into magnetism and illustrate the power of emergent particle kinetics to describe far-from-equilibrium response in complex systems...|$|E
40|$|It was {{proposed}} that spin ice, {{a class of}} rare earth titanates, hosts elementary excitations akin to magnetic monopoles. Recently, Bramwell and co-workers [arXiv:arXiv: 0907. 0956] measured the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> in Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7, directly probing {{the nature of these}} monopoles and making dysprosium titanate the first example of a magnetolyte.

40|$|In {{this review}} paper, we present and {{critically}} re-examine the formal expressions for the electrophoretic effect and the ionic field {{appearing in the}} unpublished Yale University PhD dissertation of W. S. Wilson which {{form the basis of}} the Onsager [...] Wilson theory of the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> in the binary strong electrolyte solutions. It is pointed out that some of the integrals that make up the flow velocity formula obtained in the thesis and he evaluated at the position of the center ion in the ionic atmosphere (i. e., the coordinate origin) diverge. Therefore they cannot be evaluated by means of contour integrals in the manner performed in his thesis for the reason pointed out in the text of this paper. In this paper, the results for the integrals in question are presented, which are alternatively and exactly evaluated. The details will be described in the follow-up paper presented elsewhere together with the improved formula for the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> on conductivity.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electrical}} conductivity of molten sodium and potassium chloroaluminumates increase with increasing electrical field strength and reach the limiting values. The limiting high-voltage conductivities of the melts surpass their usual {{values up to}} 200 % in NaAlCl 4 and 700 % in KAlCl 4. These results have been obtained {{on the base of}} analysis of the microsecond high-voltage discharges in the melts (the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect).</b> After the high-voltage pulses discharges having been completed in the melts, their conductivity has been found to rise up to 50 % (the “memory effect”).

40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper, the exact solution of Stokes equation was obtained for a binary strong electrolyte solution in an external electric field. In the present paper, {{the solution is}} applied to calculate the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> on deviation from the Coulombic law of conduction in high fields. One of the important aims of the present line of work was in removing or avoiding the divergence difficulty in calculating the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients. The present work achieves that aim by calculating {{on the basis of}} computing the axial velocity profiles the position of the center of the ion atmosphere {{as a function of the}} reduced field strength and therewith computing the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients for the migrating spherical ion atmosphere at each value of the reduced field strength. With the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients thus calculated along the trajectory of the center of the ion atmosphere with regard to the reduced field strength, the equivalent ionic conductance of a magnesium sulfate solution is calculated and compared with experimental data in very good accuracy. It is also compared with the prediction by Wilson's theory and is found very much improved over the latter. Moreover, the present method is divergence-free unlike Wilson's theory. It therefore not only sheds a new light on the nonequilibrium liquid structure of ionic solutions and the motion of ion atmosphere in an electric field, but also shows how the Onsager [...] Wilson theory of conductance in electrolyte solutions should be applied to account for the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> on ionic conductance.

40|$|In {{this and}} the {{following}} papers a theoretical analysis of the current-voltage characteristic of lipid bilayer membranes is presented. In order to explain the observed nonlinearity, three different mechanisms have to be considered: the injection of ions into the membrane, the distortion of the potential energy profile, and the dissociation field (or <b>Wien)</b> <b>effect.</b> In this {{first part of the}} paper, the ion injection effect is analyzed. As both the ion concentration and the thickness of the membrane are extremely small, the constant field approximation can be introduced into the Nernst-Planck equations. In this way the general treatment of Bruner can be greatly simplified, so that the solution is obtained in closed form. The result shows that the ion injection effect gives a contribution to the current-voltage characteristic only at low ionic strength (< 10 3 M) of the aqueous solution...|$|E
40|$|Theory {{predicts the}} {{low-temperature}} magnetic excitations in spin ices consist of deconfined magnetic charges, or monopoles. A recent transverse-field (TF) muon spin rotation (muSR) experiment [S T Bramwell et al, Nature 461, 956 (2009) ] reports results {{claiming to be}} consistent with the temperature and magnetic field dependence anticipated for monopole nucleation - the so-called second <b>Wien</b> <b>effect.</b> We demonstrate via a new series of muSR experiments in Dy_ 2 Ti_ 2 O_ 7 that such an effect is not observable in a TF muSR experiment. Rather, as found in many highly frustrated magnetic materials, we observe spin fluctuations which become temperature independent at low temperatures, behavior which dominates over any possible signature of thermally nucleated monopole excitations.

40|$|Perfluorinated sulfonyl-fluoride cation-exchange flat-sheet {{membranes}} {{were treated}} with ethylene diamine to investigate the influence of EDA-surface-treatment {{on the process of}} electrochemical "switching" in such membranes. The galvanodynamic method was used to obtain i-V cyclic curves of the membranes. Electroless chemical deposition of Pt particles on modified membranes was achieved using the Takenaka-Torikai method. Galvanodynamic i-V cyclic curves of the plain and platinum-containing aminated membranes were compared. Chemical modification of the membrane surface and membrane structure was investigated by means of electrical conductivity measurements and IR-spectroscopy. Experimental results indicated that the "switching" phenomenon is more likely to occur due to a pH change in the electrolyte resulting in the formation of additional fixed-charged groups in the aminated layers of the membranes rather than due to heterolytic dissociation of water according to the second <b>Wien</b> <b>effect.</b> © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Several {{investigators}} {{have demonstrated that}} under conditions where little or no gas exchange occurs across the alveolar capillary membrane the PCO 2 is higher in the alveolus than in the mixed venous blood, whereas there are no PO 2 differences. Gurtner et al. have explained the ΔPCO 2 by a model in which H+ dissociation of proteins due to an electrical field caused by a negatively charged capillary wall (<b>Wien</b> <b>effect)</b> sets up an intracapillary PCO 2 difference between wall and bulk phase which is maintained by blood flow. The model is not specific for CO 2 and predicts that weak acids should be concentrated {{in a manner similar}} to CO 2 whereas weak bases should be relatively excluded from the alveolar space. Measurements of the steady-state distribution of the uncharged forms of the weak acids 5, 5 -dimethyloxyazoladinedione (DMO) and barbital and of the weak base tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) between mixed venous blood and a fluid-filled lobe of lung were made in living dogs. The results agree fairly well with the predicted values...|$|E
30|$|PSDVB-based IEM cell {{is meant}} for base {{production}} rather than acid production because of higher specific permselectivity of CEM for H+ ions {{as reported in}} the literature (Shen et al. 2013). However, from Fig.  8, the alkalinity concentration was observed to be lower in case of PSDVB-based IEM system. Furthermore, H+ ions in the presence of water have a higher intrinsic mobility than OH− ions and thereby resulting in more leakage of H+ ions through commercial AEM. The T. No. of protons through AEM increased with the produced acid concentration which would also lead to their low concentration in AC (Liu et al. 2013). The maximum concentration remained constant until certain duration of time after which it decreased with increase in processing time for both types of IEM system. This suggested that the mass transfer of Na+ and Cl− ions through the IEM diminished due to the decrease of NaCl concentration in the feed solution. Together with the increase of the concentration of Na+ and Cl− ions in BC and AC, the molecular back diffusion through IEM caused by the high concentration gradient might hinder the transport of Na+ and Cl− ions. Furthermore, the dissociation of water molecules was also enhanced due to the Second <b>Wien</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of bipolar membranes in NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 solutions is discussed. The membranes {{are characterized}} {{in terms of}} their limiting current densities. Below the limiting current density the electric current is carried by salt ions migrating from the transition region between the anion and the cation exchange layer of the bipolar membrane. In steady state these ions are replaced by salt ions transported from the bulk solutions into the transition region by diffusion and migration {{due to the fact that}} the ion-exchange layers are not strictly permselective. When the limiting current density is exceeded, the salt transport from the transition region can no longer be compensated by the transport into the region and a drastic increase in the membrane resistance and enhanced water dissociation is observed. This water dissociation is described as being a combination of the second <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> and the protonation and deprotonation of functional groups in the membrane. The limiting current density is calculated from a mass balance that includes all components involved in the transport. The parameters used in the mathematical treatment are the diffusion coefficients of salt ions and water, the ion mobilities in the membrane, the fixed charge densitiy of the membrane, the pKb values of the functional groups and the solution bulk concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{generalised}} longitudinal susceptibility χ(q, ω) affords {{a sensitive}} {{measure of the}} spatial and temporal correlations of magnetic monopoles in spin ice. Starting with the monopole model, a mean field expression for χ(q, ω) is derived as well as expressions for the mean square longitudinal field and induction at a point. Monopole motion is shown to be strongly correlated, and both spatial and temporal correlations are controlled by the dimensionless monopole density x which defines {{the ratio of the}} magnetization relaxation rate and the monopole hop rate. Thermal effects and spin lattice relaxation are also considered. The derived equations are applicable in the temperature range where the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> for magnetic monopoles is negligible. They are discussed in the context of existing theories of spin ice and the following experimental techniques: dc and ac-magnetization, neutron scattering, neutron spin echo, and longitudinal and transverse field μSR. The monopole theory is found to unify diverse experimental results, but several discrepancies between theory and experiment are identified. One of these, concerning the neutron scattering line shape, is explained by means of a phenomenological modification to the theory. Comment: 29 pages, 4 figures; to be published in Phil.

40|$|The quantum kinetic {{equation}} for {{charged particles}} in strong electric fields {{is used to}} derive the nonlinear particle flux. The relaxation field is calculated quantum mechanically up to any order in the applied field provided a given Maxwellian plasma. The classical limit is given in analytical form. In the range of weak fields the deformation of the screening cloud {{is responsible for the}} Debye-Onsager relaxation effect. High field transport has become a topic of current interest in various fields of physics. Especially, the nonlinear current or the electrical conductivity gives access to properties of dense nonideal plasmas. At low fields we expect the linear response regime to be valid. Then the contribution of field effects to the conductivity can be condensed into the Debye- Onsager relaxation effect [1 – 5] which was first derived within the theory of electrolytes [6 – 8]. Debye has given a limiting law of electrical conductivity which stated that the external electric field E on a charge e is diminished by the amount δE = E (1 − κe 2) where κ is the inverse screening radius of the screening cloud. Later it 6 ǫ 0 T has been shown by Onsager that this result has to be corrected if the dynamics of ions is considered. In this paper we will give the complete result beyond linear response for the static case E (1 − κe 2 F(E)) similar to the theoretical 6 ǫ 0 T explanation of the <b>Wien</b> <b>effect</b> [8].
