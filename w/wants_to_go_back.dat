500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Peter discovers that his past actions have had drastic effects on the world: he and Molly {{have been married for}} 20 years; Judd Nelson crashes at their house once or twice a week; Lois is married to Quagmire; Al Gore is now the President of the United States; Chris, Meg, and Stewie have Quagmire's chin, nose, and mannerisms; and Chevy Chase is the host of The Tonight Show. Brian {{explains}} to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered the time line. Despite Brian's objections about leaving the [...] "perfect" [...] world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and Gore has killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the past so he can undo his mistake. Brian says that this is impossible because Death can only be summoned if someone dies and thanks to Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer along with a strong, well-funded educational system and zero tolerance gun control that has eliminated street crime. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls on the sidewalk and dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, he forgets a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own.|$|E
500|$|Alan Scherstuhl wrote a very {{critical}} piece for The Village Voice; {{he called the}} film predictable and repetitive, and said it contained several facts that have been clearly [...] "common knowledge for years". Scherstuhl said it is scattershot, [...] "a litany of Things We Can All Agree Are Bad", but ultimately jumps between several topicswithout sufficient detail, in his opinionbut comes to no conclusion or alternative. Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged {{and that they would}} [...] "dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is". Similarly, while saying the film discusses important issues, both Genevieve Koski of The Dissolve and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them. Koski said, [...] "The True Cost is methodical to a fault", while Kermode said it is [...] "a good starting point" [...] on the topic. Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said it has an [...] "easy-to-swallow accessibility" [...] but that it [...] "oversimplifies" [...] some aspects of the industry. In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for [...] "lots of eye-popping statements", she said, [...] "trying to do everything, he skirted a lot of things". The Los Angeles Timess Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers, saying [...] "the effects of fertilizers...don't appear quite as tangible", and faulted Morgan for not exploring [...] "retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins", but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both pro and con views. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the 1960s. She also criticized some interviewees, such as Miller, whom she called a [...] "conspiracy theorist", and Wolff, whom she called a [...] "Marxist idealist". Crocker was dismissive of the film, saying, [...] "the film loses focus and credibility, criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it".|$|E

2500|$|A {{flashback}} in [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] introduces Amy and Rory's {{childhood friend}} Mels (Nina Toussaint-White). As teenagers, it was Mels who {{pointed out that}} Rory had {{been in love with}} Amy for some time, which led to the two dating. In the present, Mels hijacks the TARDIS and directs it to 1939 where she is shot by Hitler (Albert Welling) and regenerates into River Song, revealing that Amy had grown up alongside her daughter, who was trained by the Silence to kill the Doctor. Amy is later persuaded by the Doctor to let her adult daughter make her own way in life. In [...] "The Girl Who Waited", Amy becomes separated from the Doctor and Rory on a planet's quarantine facility and lives on her own for 36 years before they return. The Doctor <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in time to rescue the younger Amy, but the older Amy insists that they take both of her. However, the Doctor knows the TARDIS will not accept the paradox and is forced to leave the older Amy behind. In [...] "The God Complex", the Doctor breaks Amy's faith in him after he discovers that they are trapped in a prison for a being that kills by feeding on faith. At the conclusion of that episode, not wanting to risk their lives further, he parts ways with her and Rory after giving them a house and car. Amy appears briefly in [...] "Closing Time", where she is shown to have become a fashion model, noted for a perfume campaign with the slogan [...] "For The Girl Who Is Tired Of Waiting". Series finale [...] "The Wedding of River Song" [...] depicts an alternate universe created by River refusing to kill the Doctor in Utah, as previously shown. Amy leads a secret organisation which fights the Silence. She reunites the Doctor with River and later kills Madame Kovarian for kidnapping Melody and depriving her of raising her baby. After history is restored, River visits Amy and reveals that the Doctor has faked his death. At the end of the 2011 Christmas special, the Doctor returns to Amy and Rory two years later (in their time) and has Christmas dinner with them.|$|E

60|$|Here again {{difficulties}} arise. It {{is difficult}} to see how, if there is only one general State publishing department, a sort of censorship can be altogether avoided, and even if, for example, one insists upon the right of every one who cares to pay for it to have matter printed, bound and issued by the public presses and binders, it still leaves a disagreeable possibility of uniformity haunting the mind. But the whole trend of administrative Socialism is towards a conception of great local governments, of land, elementary education, omnibus-transit, power distribution and the like, vesting in the hands of municipalities as great as mediæval principalities; and it seems possible to look to these great bodies and to the municipal patriotism and inter-municipal rivalries that will develop about them, for just that spirited and competitive publishing that is desirable, just as one looks now to their rivalries as a stimulus for art and architecture and public dignity and display.[25] Already, as I have pointed out in a previous chapter (Chapter IX., § 5), the decorative arts had to be rescued from the degrading influence of private enterprise; no one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now to the early Victorian state of affairs, and so it is reasonable to hope that out of the municipal art and technical schools, which teach printing, binding and the like, public presses, public binderies and all the machinery of book production may be developed in a natural and convenient manner. So, too, the municipalities might publish, seek out, maintain and honour writers and sell the books they produced, against each other all over the world. It would be a matter of pride for authors still unrecognized to go forth to the world with the arms of some great city on their covers, {{and it would be a}} matter of pride for any city to have its arms upon work become classic and immortal. So at least one method of competition is possible in this matter....|$|E

'Well, then,' the first feller'd say, 'well, sir, I ain't a-goin' to ask any favour of you. How much is your bill?' and the other feller'd say ten dollars, or fifteen, or may be twenty-five, if they thought I had that much, and the first feller'd say, 'Well, here's a gentleman from up my way, and I guess he'll advance me that much on my cheque if I make it worth his while. He knows me.' And the first thing you know--he's been treatin' you, and so polite, showin' you round, and ast you to go to the theayter--you advance the money, and you keep on with the first feller, and pretty soon he asks you to hold up a minute, he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and get a cigar; and he goes round the corner, and you hold up, and hold up, and in about a half an hour, or may be less time, you begin to smell a rat, and you go for a policeman, and the next morning you find your name in the papers, 'One more unfortunate!'
