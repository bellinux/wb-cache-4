The commonly accepted theory among historians is that the modern-day Tijuana is derived from a word belong to the Kumeyaay language – the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Tijuana derives from the Kumeyaay word Tiwan, meaning by-the-sea. Common in regional folklore, a myth exists purporting that the name is a conjunction of Tia Juana, the Spanish-language version of Aunt Jane. Tia Juana would provide food and a resting place to travelers on their journeys.

25|$|After a {{long period}} of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia {{decreased}} by a little over 3% on a yearly basis in the 3rd quarter of 2008. In the 4th quarter of 2008 the negative growth was already −9.4%. Some international experts and journalists, <b>who</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> view the three Baltic states as a single economic identity, have failed to notice that Estonia has constantly performed better than Lithuania and Latvia on many fundamental indicators. Still, in 2009 Estonia was one of the five worst performing economies in {{the world in terms of}} annual GDP growth rate. The current account deficit and inflation is lower than in Latvia, the GDP per capita is higher than in Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia's public debt is a very low 3.8% of GDP and government reserves are close to 10% of GDP. The difference is exemplified by the fact that in December 2008 Estonia became one of the donor countries to the IMF lead rescue package for Latvia.|$|E

[...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but there are some people out there <b>who</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> poke fun at the title." ...|$|E

[...] Sam Adams of the Los Angeles Times called the film a [...] "genuine tragedy, although not in the Shakespearean sense" [...] and wrote that a [...] "comprehensive list of what's wrong with Romeo & Juliet: Sealed With a Kiss would stretch farther than the unabridged works of William S." [...] LA Weeklys Luke Y. Thompson said that the film [...] "should find its primary audience among college potheads <b>who</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> watch '70s Hanna-Barbera creations on the Cartoon Network late at night." [...] Common Sense Media writer Renee Schonfeld said in his 2012 review that it was [...] "an amateurish effort with a grating villain, tired jokes, and sub-par music".

[...] Shetler concluded that [...] "every element of the song works, from the sweet whistling intro to the acoustic guitar melody to the 'oh-oh-oh-oh' vocal chants after the chorus." [...] Similarly, Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV, who viewed [...] "It Girl" [...] as Derulo's [...] "valiant attempt to trump his monstrous [...] hit 'Whatcha Say', gave the song a positive review, writing that it is catchy and it is [...] "perfectly crafted for radio success". Jess Holton of The Music Network noted that the song [...] "delivers with catchy whistling and tender lyrics" [...] and that it [...] "will appeal to the lady fans of Derulo <b>who</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see the romantic side of the crooner". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote that the song [...] "comes dangerously close to being just another bland, cookie cutter R experience, but lucky for him, that whistle gimmick in the chorus makes it a somewhat enjoyable three minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|Devil's Halo was {{released}} by Downtown Records on October 6, 2009, to generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on seven reviews. In Billboard, Gary Graff wrote that the record [...] "neatly straddles a line between challenging and accessible", featuring some of Ndegéocello's strongest compositions yet. Jurek claimed she [...] "hasn't been so nakedly vulnerable and brazenly honest on record as she is here". Tyler Lewis of PopMatters hailed it as her most consistent and [...] "emotionally potent work" [...] since 1999's Bitter while adding that Devil's Halo featured [...] "a greater sense of perspective of life's realities". According to Q, the songs expressing frantic feelings were balanced by [...] "unpredictable but always apposite moments of beauty". Salon journalist Heather Havrilesky said [...] "like a world-weary muse, Ndegéocello taps into something rich and melancholy at the sludgy bottom of our hearts" [...] while possessing a [...] "mellow depth" [...] in her singing. Washington Post critic Mark Jenkins believed the music's [...] "stripped-down approach accentuated her musical brawn". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club found the album [...] "bracingly unpredictable and persistently enjoyable; it's an art-soul record for those <b>who</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be challenged while they’re tapping their toes. Or vice versa".|$|E
500|$|Ciaran {{has stated}} that the Super Furry Animals were [...] "very hands-on" [...] during {{the making of the}} DVD. Initially the band were mainly {{concerned}} with the sound quality, describing the presentation of the album's tracks in surround sound as [...] "radical, like the change from mono to stereo". The group directed the surround sound mix themselves, instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers: [...] "We want that one bit of sound to travel from the centre, over our heads and finish on my right shoulder ... Let's have the main vocal in the middle, then each harmony in its own speaker." [...] They soon became equally as interested in the remixes, visuals and interactive elements however. Ciaran has described this process as [...] "not always a nice position to be in" [...] when, for example, they had to reject music videos they weren't happy with. The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album Guerrilla themselves. According to singer Gruff Rhys the band [...] "tended to go for illustrators who could [...] cheaply using Flash ... and artists <b>who</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work". The directors were asked to make the visuals as [...] "extreme as possible" [...] in an effort to avoid making videos that looked like just [...] "another pop promo ... like MTV" [...] and, according to Ciaran, had to [...] "work even harder at creating something interesting" [...] due to the limited budget available. Many of those who made videos for the DVD release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a [...] "really fresh ... kind of scruffy" [...] end product. According to Rhys the band made separate music videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for the songs. Rhys {{has stated that}} the Super Furry Animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on the videos on Rings Around the World rather than concentrating on the music, as a result of which the band used [...] "really bland images" [...] on the DVD release of their next album Phantom Power.|$|E
