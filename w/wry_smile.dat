[...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son.

Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it."

50|$|Billy Bibby & The <b>Wry</b> <b>Smiles</b> are a British indie {{rock band}} {{formed in the}} autumn of 2015 in the area around Llandudno, North Wales and Chester, UK. The band is fronted by Billy Bibby, former lead guitarist and {{founding}} member of Catfish and the Bottlemen.

Soon thereafter, Billy Bibby began writing songs and playing acoustic shows in various UK cities in order to test public response to his new music. In the spring of 2015, Billy Bibby began seeking musicians to form a new band. Auditions were conducted with the help of Simon Jones, formerly of The Verve. Band members Rob Jones (lead guitar), Matt Bassy (bass), and Michael Pearce (drums) were selected to form the four-piece ensemble.|$|R

Others have described noises such as running water the S- as through a shell; a high-pitched scream; a swarm of bees; the sound of Ping-Pong balls; birds; heartkats; an air-raid warning; and a large truck, among others.

Since then, we’ve kept in touch periodically. He is now professor emeritus of computer sciences at the University of Pemsylvania, Philadelphia.

40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the great}} pleasures and {{challenges}} of the Advanced Placement Program that many of the central enduring dilemmas of a discipline insist upon resolution. The sort of matters that can provoke the <b>wry</b> <b>smiles</b> of seasoned colleagues across a faculty meeting require concrete resolution for the real-world operation of this large-scale liberal arts enterprise seeking to span the realms of school and college. These matters can not be for us, in that lamentable popular expression, 2 ̆ 2 an academic question. 2 ̆ 2 Courses need to be taught, teachers supported, students challenged, work assessed. And what are these dilemmas? Our authors have set some of these on the table for us: What constitutes the survey, and what are its central goals? How do we 2 ̆ 2 reconcile the tyranny of generalization with the anarchy of the particular 2 ̆ 2 as Jonathan Chu so nicely puts it? How do we ensure that new research in women 2 ̆ 7 s history - or any other new threads of scholarship for that matter - gets integrated into college and AP high school courses, and avoids the 2 ̆ 2 add women and stir 2 ̆ 2 recipe approach Mary Frederickson so aptly captured? (I do note it is a cooking metaphor, but will leave it there). How do we get beyond the 2 ̆ 2 basic mantra of patriarchal hegemony, 2 ̆ 2 as Mary argues, and destabilize the survey a bit, even perhaps transforming it by letting go of chronology some, by subverting the 2 ̆ 2 tyranny of coverage, 2 ̆ 2 and by stopping cleaning up the dirty mess that is our wonderful human heritage, arriving someday, just maybe, beyond the 2 ̆ 2 unsexed and neutered 2 ̆ 2 stories, learning more richly about women and men? How do we move ethnicity and immigration beyond, as Diane Vecchio urges, their bounded period units and beyond their association with 2 ̆ 2 problems 2 ̆ 2 ? And in all of this, how can we insure, as Uma Venkateswaran has illustrated, that the way we assess student achievement fairly reflects what we 2 ̆ 7 re after, and also helps us understand what in fact is happening in classrooms around the country, so that we can inform ourselves more accurately of the status of this noble craft? For the survey, and therefore for the AP United States history course, these questions get answered whether explicitly addressed or not. AP is a mirror, if you will, as faithful as our approaches allow, to the answers made by faculty on their own...|$|R

The buying of this brooch {{took a long time}} at the jeweller's in the rue des Romains, and she had only just fixed on an {{amethyst}} before feeling deadly ill with a dreadful pain through her lungs. She went out with her tiny package quickly, not wanting any fuss, and began to mount towards home. There were only three hundred yards to go, and with each step she said to herself: [...] "Nonsense! What would the Queen think of you! Remember the poor soldiers with only one leg! You have got both your legs! And the poor men who walk from the battlefield with bullets through the lungs.

So there!" [...] She felt as if perspiration were flowing down, yet her face was as dry as a dead leaf when she put up her hand to it. Her brain stammered; seemed to fly loose; came to sudden standstills. Her eyes searched painfully each grey-shuttered window for her own house, though she knew quite well that she had not reached it yet. From sheer pain she stood still, a <b>wry</b> little <b>smile</b> on her lips, thinking how poor Polly would say: [...] "Keep smiling!" [...] Then she moved on, holding out her hand, whether because she thought God would put his into it or only to pull on some imaginary rope to help her.

The pain ceased, and as if she had passed through no doors, mounted no stairs--she was up in her room, lying on her sofa, with strange images about her, painfully conscious that she was not in proper control of her thoughts, and that Augustine must be thinking her ridiculous.
