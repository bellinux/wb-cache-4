3000|$|The {{second phase}} of {{fieldwork}} was conducted in 2011 by an anthropologist and included eight interviews centred on the contemporary scientific publications on moths, reindeer and mountain birches (e.g. Klemola et al. 2003, Klemola 2009, Tømmervik et al. 2009, Ammunét 2011). The results put forward in these publications were presented in popular form to the herders, who were asked key questions such as: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if outbreaks of both autumnal and winter moth become more common as the climate gets warmer? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{about the impact of}} global warming and reindeer on the growth of birch trees? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of reindeer herding? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of the mountain birch forests in your area?

60|$|Suddenly Jerry Muskrat heard a {{sound that}} made him prick up his funny little short ears and whirl about {{so that he could}} look over {{the other side of the}} dam into the Laughing Brook. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sound was? Why, it was the sound of rushing water, the sweetest sound Jerry had listened to for a long time.

"I understand, Mr. O'Connor; it {{is quite}} right {{for you to say}} so, and I {{thoroughly}} recognize that they must have done good service; but it is to the man that plans, organizes, and infuses his own spirit into those under his command, that everything is due. Now, Mr. O'Connor, I think I will ask you to leave us for a few minutes; the case is rather an exceptional one, and I shall be glad to chat the matter over with the officers present. Well, gentlemen, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we are to do with Mr. O'Connor?" [...] he went on, with a smile, as the door closed behind Terence.|$|E

How you came through them passes my comprehension; but if your fellow-messenger had had but as little sense as you, my whole plan of campaign would have been ruined. Can you not see, coglione, that this message contained false news, and that it was intended to deceive the enemy whilst I put a very different scheme into execution?' ...|$|E

60|$|Now <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{right down}} in their hearts all these little {{people who came to}} jeer at Shadow the Weasel hoped they would see? Why, they hoped they would see Shadow afraid. Yes, Sir, that is just what they hoped. But they didn't. That is where they were disappointed. Not once did Shadow show the least sign of fear. He didn't know what Farmer Brown's boy would do with him, and he had every reason to fear that if he was not to be kept a {{prisoner}} {{for the rest of his}} natural life, something dreadful would be the end. But he was too proud and too brave to let any one know that any such fear ever entered his mind. Whatever his faults, Shadow is no coward. He boldly took bits of meat which Farmer Brown's boy brought to him, and not once appeared in the least afraid, so that, much as he disliked him, Farmer Brown's boy actually had to admire him. He was a prisoner, but he kept just as stout a heart as ever.|$|E
