25|$|The {{wind blows}} faster at higher altitudes {{because of the}} reduced {{influence}} of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings. Typically, the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a <b>wind</b> <b>profile</b> power law, which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude. Doubling the altitude of a turbine, then, increases the expected wind speeds by 10%, and the expected power by 34%.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal rolls are {{counter-rotating}} vortex rolls {{that are}} nearly {{aligned with the}} mean wind of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). They {{can be caused by}} convection {{in the presence of a}} moderate wind and/or dynamic inflection point instabilities in the mean <b>wind</b> <b>profile.</b> Early theory on the features predict that the vortices may be aligned up to 30° to the left for stably stratified environments, 18° to the left for neutral environments, and nearly parallel to the mean wind for unstably stratified (convective) environments. This theory has been supported by aircraft observations from several field experiments.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Uranus is calm {{compared to those}} of other giant planets. Only a limited number of small bright clouds at middle latitudes in both hemispheres and one Uranus Dark Spot have been observed since 1986. One of those bright cloud features, located at −34° of latitude and called Berg, probably existed continuously since at least 1986. Nevertheless, the Uranian atmosphere has rather strong zonal winds blowing in the retrograde (counter to the rotation) direction near the equator, but switching to the prograde direction poleward of ±20° latitude. The wind speeds are from −50 to −100m/s at the equator increasing up to 240m/s near 50° latitude. The <b>wind</b> <b>profile</b> measured before the equinox of 2007 was slightly asymmetric with winds stronger in the southern hemisphere, although {{it turned out to be}} a seasonal effect as this hemisphere was continuously illuminated by the Sun before 2007. After 2007 winds in the northern hemisphere accelerated while those in the southern one slowed down.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} some reasons to believe that {{seasonal}} changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus {{is known to have}} a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the albedo patterns. In addition, the microwave data showed increases in pole–equator contrast after the 1986 solstice. Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, having bolstered expectations that it would brighten soon. In particular, an analog of the bright polar collar present in its southern hemisphere at −45° was expected to appear in its northern part. This indeed happened in 2007 when Uranus passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, whereas the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal <b>wind</b> <b>profile</b> remained asymmetric, with northern winds being slightly slower than southern.|$|E

In addition, the dry line was diffused, with surface winds behind and ahead of the boundary moving into the region from a southerly direction.

2500|$|The linear approximation, the eddy {{diffusivity}} equation with an {{eddy diffusion}} coefficient K, allowed Ekman {{to obtain a}} simple logarithmic spiral solution. However the frequent presence of the horizontal roll vortices in the PBL, which represent an organization of the turbulence (coherent structures), indicate that the diffusivity approximation is not adequate. Ekman’s solution has an intrinsic inflectional <b>wind</b> <b>profile</b> that {{was found to be}} unstable to long waves corresponding to the organized large vortices scale. The nonlinear theory showed that the growth of these finite perturbation waves modifies the mean flow, eliminating the dynamic inflectional instability energy so that equilibrium is obtained.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to use an}} aircraft to measure <b>wind</b> <b>profiles</b> in the altitude range of 1, 500 to 18, 200 m was demonstrated at NASA Ames-Dryden. This demonstration was initiated to determine if an aircraft could measure <b>wind</b> <b>profiles</b> in support of space shuttle launches. The Jimsphere balloon is currently the device used to measure pre-launch <b>wind</b> <b>profiles</b> for the space shuttle. However, it takes approximately an hour for the Jimsphere to travel through the altitudes of interest. If these wind instruments could be taken with an aircraft closer to launch in a more timely manner and with the same accuracy as a Jimsphere balloon, some uncertainties in the measurements could be removed. The aircraft used for this investigation was an F- 104 G which is capable of flight above 18, 000 m.
