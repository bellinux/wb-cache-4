25|$|Most of Plato's {{philosophical}} {{ideas were}} communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as {{a presence in}} the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be safe to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.|$|E

25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E

500|$|Hewson {{has long}} {{advocated}} for a children's museum for Ireland, {{inspired by a}} positive experience her daughters had at the Dallas Children's Museum in the mid-1990s. In 2003, plans were announced to build the so-called Exploration Station {{as part of an}} overall €500million Heuston Gate development project near the Dublin Heuston railway station. The children-oriented science centre was to be owned by the Irish Children's Museum charitable trust, with Hewson as a prominent member of the museum. Hewson said, [...] "Seeing as we're nearly the last European country in on it, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> from children's museums already up and running and expand on them." [...] However, {{over the next few years}} the science centre faced significant cost overruns in the planning stages and a possible European Commission investigation into how the Office of Public Works had handled the awarding of the contract for it. The effects of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 then put a halt to the entire Heuston Gate project. As of November 2012, there were no signs that the Heuston Gate or science centre projects would be revived.|$|E

Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.|$|E

2500|$|The first federal by-elections contested by the Liberals under Dion's {{leadership}} {{took place}} on 18 September 2007, in three Quebec ridings: Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean, Outremont and Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. The party's candidates were defeated by large margins in all three races. The Outremont by-election was deemed a crucial test for Dion's leadership by some pundits, {{as it had been}} held by the Liberals almost uninterruptedly since 1935. Others said it was a [...] "poor measure of where the parties really stand." [...] Dion's handpicked candidate Jocelyn Coulon, who was selected over Justin Trudeau, was defeated by the NDP's Thomas Mulcair. A Dion aide blamed the Outremont by-election on several factors, including poor organization, lack of communications, and lack of a clear policy on Quebec, while former MP Jean Lapierre suggested that it was due to Dion's 14% approval rating in the province. In addition, the Halifax Chronicle-Herald reported that unidentified [...] "Dion loyalists" [...] were accusing Michael Ignatieff supporters of undermining by-election efforts. Though Ignatieff phoned up Dion to deny the allegations, the Globe and Mail suggested that the report had a negative impact on the Liberals' morale, citing the NDP's widening lead after the article's release. Undaunted, Dion declared: [...] "From this defeat, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> something and work together as a united party." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "In most conflicts, {{each party}} is certain {{he is right}} and the other wrong. And in the reality he lives in, this is {{genuinely}} the case. But in order to solve a conflict like ours, {{it is necessary to}} step into the reality of the 'other' – to see the world and events from his subjective perspective so that we can reconcile his reality with our own and merge these opposing versions of events into a bigger holistic truth inclusive enough to encompass both ostensibly rival truths. These subjective perceptions of reality constitute unique 'movies' in which we are each the protagonist. And any genuine approach to Israeli–Palestinian peace requires us to recognize the completely separate broader movies our two peoples each collectively live in. Both have experienced the past hundred years very differently and the major obstacle to attaining peace has almost nothing to do with territory but rather the inability on both sides to acknowledge, understand or accept the narrative of the 'other' without defensively feeling our own narratives threatened. I define the term 'narrative' here as a version of reality – a story told about a chain of events that organizes facts while being influenced by ideology. The same chain of events can be organized into many narratives, especially if influenced by different ideologies. The separate movies we live in very much impact how we relate to history, to ourselves and to each other in this country. Both sides tend to approach the conflict as a zero-sum game where there can only be one winner. And the conflict continues to rage partially because many of us are so trapped within our narrow paradigms that we refuse to acknowledge how things may look from different perspectives. Advocates on both sides often cite hard facts to support their positions. And while these facts might be true, they are not the only facts. And how we select, connect, contextualize and understand them is very much determined by the movies we live in. ... There is so much blame and pain powering this conflict. And acknowledging the narrative of the 'other' often feels like betraying our own. But if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> to see the greater movie comprising both our smaller movies and define the core aspirations and grievances of each side, we can begin to chart a course that allows both peoples to be protagonists in a single story that successfully transcends the dualistic 'Arab versus Jew' paradigm and enables us all to experience the fulfillment of our deepest yearnings." ...|$|E
