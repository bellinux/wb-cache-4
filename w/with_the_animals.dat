5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Filmation began {{producing}} several new {{series for the}} Big Three television networks. They started creating live action series, instead of just animation ones, and also series that combined both. While {{a majority of the}} series was animated, live-action segments involving actual animals were also included to separate different scenes in an episode. According to Scheimer, filming <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> was tough, as the bulldog who portrayed Tyrone would often chase the cats on set around and not stay still during filming.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California {{found them to be}} placid and that they could interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals.</b> Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts. Analyses using molecular phylogenetics support a monophyletic origin of the Fungi. The taxonomy of the Fungi {{is in a state of}} constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E
5|$|Beale {{suggested}} that, {{in addition}} to a military fort, the route was also in immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements. Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and San Bernardino, California, a distance of , were the Zuni and Laguna pueblos. According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his initial survey of the route, and his interpreter, Petro. Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> in the pack train. The Rose–Baley Party paid Savedra's fee of $500 in advance.|$|E
30|$|In <b>the</b> 12 {{trainees}} <b>with</b> {{experience in}} retrieval of a filter, the mean time for retrieval in <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> model was 292 [*]±[*] 278  s {{in those who}} trained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> model prior to training <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blood vessel model (n[*]=[*] 5) and 311 [*]±[*] 224  s in those who first trained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blood vessel model (n[*]=[*] 7).

5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> included, {{experienced}} a revival {{in parts of}} late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, the zoo {{opened the}} $11.5 million Tropical Discovery exhibit. Designed by the Denver {{architectural}} firm Anderson Mason Dale, this indoor tropical garden topped by glass pyramids is the aquarium and herpetarium of the Denver Zoo, and its opening doubled both {{the number of}} species and the number of animals at the zoo.

The army took more than six hours to thoroughly level the entire zoo and the adjacent decades-old olive grove. After the destruction, soldiers took possession of the house of one of the owners of the zoo, Mohammed Ahmed Juma, in the same compound and held him and his family hostage, while securing the terrain with tanks.|$|E

25|$|Training of {{the camel}} corps had {{less to do}} with the Egyptian camel drivers who were often {{familiar}} with camel care and control, being mainly concerned with the problems the Australian and British officers and NCOs, who had transferred from the Army Service Corps and other AIF units, had in dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals.</b> During this time, {{one or more of these}} men were regularly sent to hospitals with camel bites. Of the Australians, 49 were eventually commissioned and six became company commanders, so the Anzac and Imperial/Australian Mounted Divisions had a strong national component in their supporting camel transport.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{in about}} 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was {{developed}} as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down {{the south side of}} the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day Ontario, Oregon. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> down into the Snake River canyon to get water. Travellers on this route avoided two dangerous crossings of the Snake River. Today's Idaho State Route 78 roughly follows the path of the South Alternate route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E
25|$|Native American—specifically the Creek's—beliefs {{revolved}} around respecting the environment. The Creek {{believed they had}} a unique relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> they hunted. The Creek had several rules surround how a hunt could occur, particularly prohibiting needless killing of deer. There were specific taboos against taking the skins of unhealthy deer. However, the lucrative deerskin trade prompted hunters to act {{past the point of}} restraint they had operated under before. The hunting economy collapsed due to the scarcity of deer as they were over-hunted and lost their lands to white settlers. Due to the decline of deer populations, and the governmental pressure to switch to the colonists’ way of life, animal husbandry replaced deer hunting both as an income and in the diet.|$|E
