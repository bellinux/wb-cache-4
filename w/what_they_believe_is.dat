5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and {{his friend}} Captain Haddock plan an {{expedition}} to the West Indies aboard a fishing trawler, the Sirius, {{to search for the}} treasure of the pirate Red Rackham. Having previously read three parchments authored by Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, the duo had discovered the coordinates to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> the treasure aboard the sunken 17th century vessel, the Unicorn, near an unknown island. An eccentric, hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers to aid them with the use of his shark-shaped one-man submarine, but they decline his assistance. Setting sail, they are joined by the police detectives Thomson and Thompson and soon discover that Calculus has stowed away on board, bringing his submarine with him.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{conversion}} in the 19th {{century to}} Christianity by Welsh Baptist missionaries, the Chin, Kuki, and Mizo peoples were animists; among their practices were ritual headhunting.

25|$|Defeating ISIS: Who They Are, How They Fight, <b>What</b> <b>They</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>is</b> a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism against ISIS. It {{was written by}} Malcolm Nance, a former {{cryptology}} analyst, with a foreword by Richard Engel. Nance's thesis in the work is that ISIS {{is not part of}} Islam, and instead functions as destructive extremist group. He emphasizes a majority of those harmed by ISIS are themselves Muslim. The book traces the history of the movement from Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and discusses their combat and recruiting tactics. Nance offers a four-point plan to defeat ISIS, including airpower and special forces, Internet tactics, strengthening the Syrian military, and engaging Arab world states.|$|E

500|$|Khan {{returns in}} the 1982 feature film [...] Captain Clark Terrell (Paul Winfield) and First Officer Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) of USS Reliant {{are searching for}} an {{uninhabited}} world to test the Genesis device, a powerful terraforming tool. They beam down to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> Ceti Alpha VI. Khan's followers capture Terrell and Chekov, and Khan explains that the barren world is Ceti Alpha V; the sixth planet of the system exploded shortly after Khan and his followers were marooned. The cataclysm caused massive climate disturbances, rendering the planet into a desert, {{and many of the}} survivors—including Khan's wife—were killed by the only surviving species of animal, the Ceti eel. Only twenty of Khan's followers survive. Swearing vengeance on Kirk, Khan implants Ceti eels in Terrell and Chekov's brains, rendering them vulnerable to suggestion. Khan then seizes control of Reliant, intent on capturing the Genesis device.|$|E
500|$|Many {{supporters}} of Native American mascots {{feel that the}} financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate {{millions of dollars in}} sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: [...] "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk {{in one hand and a}} beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us.

500|$|Meanwhile, in the present, The Lone Gunmen inform Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that they}} have lost contact with Mulder, who had set out {{in search of the}} Queen Anne.

She finally threatens Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) before Skinner shows up and provides her with the information from the Pentagon. Scully leaves with the Gunmen to find Mulder. On the Queen Anne, a British sailor tells Mulder that the Germans are looking for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> a weapon called [...] "Thor's Hammer". Mulder tells him that Thor's Hammer is not a weapon, but a scientist that will build a weapon. The sailor, however, {{turns out to be a}} German spy and locks Mulder in the engine room with the ship's crew. One of the sailors, who strongly resembles Kersh, decides to steer the boat to Jamaica, but Mulder tells them to sail back where they came from, in order to pass through the time warp and re-appear in 1998.|$|E
500|$|The {{two parts}} of [...] "Stress Relief" [...] ran an hour long (including commercials), {{compared}} to the typical half-hour length of most The Office episodes. Since {{the end of the}} second season, the series had begun occasionally showing longer episodes (which they dubbed [...] "super-sized") on special occasions. Unlike other episodes of The Office, [...] "Stress Relief" [...] included an extended main title sequence that included the names and images of the entire supporting cast of the series, in order to afford them recognition in anticipation of the high post-Super Bowl viewership. The opening scene, in which the characters frantically scramble to escape the Dunder Mifflin office due to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> a fire, took about a day-and-a-half to shoot. It took much longer than the average 45 minutes of shooting time for a scene of that length due to the amount of stunt work involved. Due to the pressure of following the Super Bowl, actress Jenna Fischer said, [...] "I don't think we've ever worked so hard on an episode in the history of our show." [...] The Office actor and writer B. J. Novak, who did not appear in [...] "Stress Relief", said of the episode, [...] "It's awesome.

500|$|On September 23, 2009, the {{paramilitary}} EBP joined the political {{branch of the}} Macheteros, the Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores Puertorriqueños, in an event named Vigilia por la Dignidad held at Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, in honor of Ojeda Ríos. There both groups agreed that they would promote an agenda of unity with other sectors of society to confront what they perceived as [...] "a fascist repression" [...] being imposed {{by the government and}} manipulated by [...] " [...] that control large amounts of capital". The EPB and PRTP stated that Fortuño represented the [...] "lords of capital" [...] and that his administration was surrendering control of the government and justice system to these interests. The organizations argued that finality was economic gain {{at the expense of the}} public and that they employed open class warfare against it, approving laws without feedback and enforcing other measures. The EBP and PRTP concluded this communiqué by suggesting that public manifestations, armed resistance and independentist unity would be required to counteract the administration. In a different topic, the EPB provided an extended critique of the Puerto Rican statehood movement. In denoting <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "true face of anexionism", referring to right-wing Republicans such as Fortuño, Rivera Schatz and Jennifer González, the group quoted Ojeda Ríos opinion of the newly elected governor. The EPB argued that those wealthy interests pushed Fortuño by exploiting modern propaganda methods, such as the internet and media, and that the federal government [...] "employed its creativity" [...] to ensure his election by indicting the former governor after the political campaign had begun. The organization interpreted this as a showcase of the [...] "power of transnational corporation to manipulate the economic and political" [...] system, and argued that the austerity measures were part of a plan to satisfy the bond-holders, multinationals, developers and businessmen and [...] "to present statehood as the only solution" [...] to an [...] "intentionally exacerbated crisis". The EBP also criticized unions for their perceived [...] "dispersion", [...] "lack of ideological definition" [...] and [...] "unwilliness to radicalize their struggle", asking them to seek coordinated efforts that entice [...] "the evolution of revolutionary postures within the middle class and the public in general". The organization then urged other independentist groups to cease cooperating with other entities that [...] "seek sovereignty but not independence", in particular with the free association movement, and to pursue unity to face the [...] "militaristic" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] actions of an administration that [...] "leans towards dictatorship".|$|E
