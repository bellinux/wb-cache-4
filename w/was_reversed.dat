5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} {{in the late}} 1920s, connecting US Highway10 (US10, Woodward Avenue, now M-1) with US25 (Gratiot Avenue, now M-3). Extensions to the highway designation moved the termini in the 1930s and 1940s east to M-29 (Jefferson Avenue) and US16 (Grand River Avenue, now M-5). A change in the 1960s added a section of north–south roadway to {{the eastern end of}} M-102; that change <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> within about a year. A western extension along Grand River Avenue in 1977 <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> in 1994, and M-102 has remained the same since.|$|E
5|$|Chris's loss on the Vortex <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> after {{a review}} of a smaller camera {{underneath}} the Vortex that showed the ball dropping and landing milliseconds before the change in colour to red, thus the money was awarded to him— also note that the rollover still stood.|$|E
30|$|The above eight {{transition}} rules <b>are</b> <b>reverse</b> {{transition rules}} for the static parallel operator | and say that s| t can reverse in a real parallel pattern. When both s and t <b>are</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully, we define s| t <b>is</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully.|$|R

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1929, the highway was rerouted between Saginaw and Reese, using a set of {{parallel}} roadways to the south of the previous routing; this change <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> in 1933. M-81 was fully paved when the last section between Ellington and Elmwood in Tuscola County was finished in late 1946 or early 1947.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1974, {{under the}} Local Government Act 1972, Carmarthenshire joined Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire {{in the new}} county of Dyfed; Carmarthenshire was divided into three districts: Carmarthen, Llanelli and Dinefwr. Twenty-two years later this {{amalgamation}} <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> when, under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the original county boundaries were reinstated.|$|E
5000|$|Non-depolarizing {{blockers}} <b>are</b> <b>reversed</b> by acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs since non-depolarizing blockers are competitive antagonists at the ACh receptor so can <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> by {{increases in}} ACh.|$|R
30|$|The {{last four}} {{transition}} rules say that s· t can <b>reverse</b> sequentially, that <b>is,</b> it <b>reverses</b> t {{in the first}} and leads to a successful atomic action, after successful reverse of t, then reverse of s follows. When both s and t <b>are</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully, we define s· t <b>is</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully.|$|R
30|$|The {{next four}} {{transition}} rules say that s+t can reverse both branches, only by executing the same histories of atomic actions. When one branch s or t <b>is</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully, we define s+t <b>is</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully.|$|R

Beyond Cincinnati, at a Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (C) yard in Ashland, Kentucky, the two trains were decoupled and then proceeded separately to Catlettsburg, Kentucky and points east, with the Mountaineer roughly twenty-five minutes behind the Riley. Westbound the procedure <b>was</b> <b>reversed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women's life {{expectancy}} is {{greater than that of}} men, and they have lower death rates throughout life, regardless of race and geographic region. Historically though, women had higher rates of mortality, primarily from maternal deaths (death in childbirth).

5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was {{the construction of a}} pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US23 interchange in 2006.|$|E
5|$|As this {{statement}} was not true, Alvarez was indicted {{for violating the}} Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, {{the place where the}} trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that the Act was unconstitutional.

5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but this decision <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935.|$|E

In 2015, this decision <b>was</b> <b>reversed,</b> and two events were scheduled, in April and October.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 William Champion, and Lord Dysart, {{operators}} {{of the nearby}} Twickenham Ferry, took legal action against Hammerton to remove his right to operate the ferry. Although Hammerton won the initial case, the judgement <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> on appeal.

5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} a break in {{tradition}} when the Echo title-piece appeared reversed out in white on a red background, instead of the more familiar red or black lettering.

It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change <b>was</b> <b>reversed</b> in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E
