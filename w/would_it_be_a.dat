500|$|When {{they began}} {{recording}} in studio in June 2012, the band's members felt little pressure {{to complete the}} album as they could deliver something similar to their previous album [...] "if you've delivered once already, why <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem to do it again? We are the band that made those records [...] so there's really no problem in that regard." [...] Guitarist Jeff Sahyoun {{said he did not}} even think back on Fake History when they were producing The Blackest Beautiful. However, as they progressed through it, there were elements that were not clicking, and the performances lacked the same bite in comparison to their Fake History demos. [...] Butler said that this [...] "almost sent the band crazy". He said he required a specific environment when he sings as his performance puts him in a vulnerable state.|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence Lessig {{wrote of}} the bill, [...] "this is a {{critically}} important change.... The CFAA was the hook for the government's bullying.... This law would remove that hook. In a single line: no longer <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> felony to breach a contract." [...] Professor Orin Kerr, a specialist in the nexus between computer law and criminal law, wrote {{that he had been}} arguing for precisely this sort of reform of the Act for years. The ACLU, too, has called for reform of the CFAA to [...] "remove the dangerously broad criminalization of online activity." [...] The EFF has mounted a campaign for these reforms.|$|E
2500|$|To {{cast the}} role of Buckaroo Banzai, Richter wanted an actor who [...] "could both look heroic with grease all over his face, and project the kind of {{intelligence}} you would associate with a neurosurgeon and inventor". The studio wanted a recognizable movie star, but Richter and Canton wanted to cast a relatively unknown actor. Richter looked in New York City because he assumed that an actor with experience on stage and small films [...] "would be able to completely interact with props". He had been impressed by Peter Weller's performance in Shoot the Moon and met with him. At first, the actor was hesitant to take the role because he was unclear on the overall tone of the movie. [...] "Would it be campy? <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cartoon? Or would it be the sort of wacky, realistic film that would catch people sideways—and not be a cartoon", Weller remembers thinking. Richter told him Banzai's story and convinced Weller to do the film. The actor says that he based his character on Elia Kazan, Jacques Cousteau, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, and Adam Ant.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of their new building at Spring Hill, the MRD was accommodated in buildings [...] "scattered throughout the city". The intention of the new building was to provide better working facilities and amenities for an increasing staff in an efficient and productive environment.
