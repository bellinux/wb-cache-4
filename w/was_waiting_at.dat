5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 November {{and became the}} flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived {{before the end of}} January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 1907 {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{took place at}} Spence's Box at the Summer Road crossing; the workers' train <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> the junction signal for a clear road, and a descending loaded mineral train got {{out of control and}} ran through the signals, destroying the pug engine and carriages of the workers' train. The approach of the out-of-control train was given warning and most of the passengers and crew had left the train.|$|E
25|$|The {{windscreen}} wipers were {{powered by a}} purely mechanical system: a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered the speedometer. The wipers' speed was therefore dependent on car speed. When the car <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> a crossroad, the wipers were not powered; thus, a handle under the speedometer allowed them to be operated by hand. From 1962, the wipers were powered by a single-speed electric motor. The car came with only a speedometer and an ammeter.|$|E

25|$|From Immola Airfield, Hitler, {{accompanied}} by President Ryti, {{was driven to}} the place where Mannerheim <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> a railway siding. After a speech from Hitler, and following a birthday meal and negotiations between him and Mannerheim, Hitler returned to Germany. President Ryti and other high-ranking Finns and Germans were also present. Hitler spent about five hours in Finland. Hitler reportedly intended to ask the Finns to step up military operations against the Soviets, but he apparently made no specific demands.|$|E
25|$|When {{the safety}} {{car and the}} drivers behind it are on the start/finish straight, there is a red light at the exit of the pit lane. Drivers who go past the red light are disqualified from the race. This has {{happened}} to several drivers during the years, such as Giancarlo Fisichella and Felipe Massa in the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix. At the same race a year later, Lewis Hamilton failed to notice the red light and slammed {{into the back of}} the car of Kimi Räikkönen, who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> the end of the pit lane alongside Robert Kubica.|$|E
25|$|Isabel Peake, a 20-year-old English {{student at}} Limoges university, who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> Limoges station for {{a train to}} Paris {{on her way home}} to Barlaston, Staffordshire. On 13 October 1999, she boarded the train to Paris, on her way home for a visit. Her body was found the next day by a local farmer who {{discovered}} her partially-clothed and dismembered corpse, and her baggage was found strewn along the line. Before dawn, police think she was pushed from the train as it travelled at about 125km/h (78mph) through the disused station at Chabenet, central France, possibly after a sexual assault.|$|E

25|$|At 3:07pm on 21 March 2002, Dowler left Heathside School in Weybridge {{and walked}} to Weybridge railway station with a friend. The girls got off at Walton-on-Thames railway station, one stop before Dowler's usual stop of Hersham, and went to eat at the station cafe. After Dowler telephoned her father at 3:47pm to say she would be home in half an hour, the girls left the cafe at 4:05, with Dowler walking home alone. She was last seen three minutes later, walking along Station Avenue, by a friend of her sister, who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> a bus stop. A closed-circuit {{television}} camera located further along the road showed no images of Dowler. A red Daewoo Nexia, which belonged to Levi Bellfield's girlfriend Emma Mills, was photographed driving past by the same camera at 4:32 pm. In an April 2009 interview, Bellfield {{said that he was}} driving the car.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Aragon {{provided}} new ships {{to help maintain}} the siege: the Vice Admiral of Valencia, Jaime Escribano, arrived in mid-August with ten Aragonese galleys. These boats and another fifteen Castilian ships commanded by Admiral Egidio Boccanegra were sent to Ceuta {{to do as much}} damage as possible to the fleet of the King of Morocco, who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> this port for the arrival of the fleet from Granada to go to Algeciras' aid. In the first encounter, the Christians tried to surprise the Muslim fleet by sending into combat only the fifteen Castilian ships, while the Aragonese ships maneuvered as if preparing to go to the aid of the Moroccans. The strategy would have been expensive to the Moroccans had they not captured a Castilian sailor before the final encounter, who warned them of the ruse. The ships from Ceuta quickly returned to port and the Christian fleet had to return to the Bay of Algeciras. On his return back at the siege, Egidio Boccanegra sent twenty of his ships to wait at Getares, ready to intercept the Moors if they decided to attack the encirclement.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they left}} home these armies and fleets {{had to be}} supplied, not only with food and {{clothing}} for the men but also forage for the horses which gave them mobility and were fitting to their Station. Yet if armies of the seventh and eighth centuries were accompanied by servants and a supply train of lesser free men, Alfred found these arrangements insufficient to defeat the Vikings. One of his reforms, if {{he was responsible for}} them, was to divide his military resources into three. One part manned the burhs and found the permanent garrisons which would make it impossible for the Danes to overrun Wessex, although they would also take to the field when extra soldiers were needed. The remaining two would take it in turns to serve. They were allocated a fixed term of Service and brought the necessary provisions with them. This arrangement did not always function perfectly. On one occasion a division on Service went home in the middle of blockading a Danish army on Thorney Island, its provisions consumed and its term expired, before the king came to relieve them. This method of division and rotation remained in force right up to 1066. In 917, when armies from Wessex and Mercia were in the field from early April until November, one division went home and another took over. Again, in 1052 when Edward's fleet <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> Sandwich to intercept Godwine's return, the ships returned to London to take on new earls and crews. The importance of supply, vital to military success, was appreciated even if it was taken for granted and features only incidentally in the sources.|$|E

500|$|Lost Luggage was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo, a video game studio based in Richardson, Texas, which targeted the game at people who traveled regularly, believing {{that they would like}} its content. At the time of Lost Luggages development, the company employed five people. The game was conceived by programmer Ed Salvo. He had been at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after a meeting with Apollo founder Pat Roper and <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> the carousel for his luggage to arrive. Later, Salvo discussed the concept of the game with Roper, and they {{came up with the idea}} to have the carousel [...] "spewing unmentionables." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E
