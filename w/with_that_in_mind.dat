5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog Fractions {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} their reactions when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog Fractions was taken more seriously among gamers. Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games, he never intentionally developed Frog Fractions <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Instead, Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an educational theme because of the name's alliteration, and because he considered educational games {{a part of his}} youth.|$|E
5|$|Angel of Darkness was {{received}} poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of Darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E
5|$|At the Conservatoire Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and {{the piano}} with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the {{beginning}} of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet's health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved with him. Again, Massenet's own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the Conservatoire in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire's top prize for pianists. The family's finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work in the orchestra pit gave him a good working knowledge of the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the Conservatoire went on to substantial careers as church organists; <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.|$|E

25|$|As all {{the polls}} around the country closed at 7p.m., the first exit polls were {{published}} by the major television networks. They showed Ivo Josipović easily claiming first place, but failing to obtain an outright majority winning 32%. The polls showed Milan Bandić, Andrija Hebrang and Nadan Vidošević in a statistical tie with each of them achieving 14%, 12% and 11% respectively. Andrija Hebrang's third place {{was seen as a}} great success as most opinion polls before the first round showed him with only single-digit approval, while Nadan Vidošević's placing was seen as a disappointment since most polls before the vote showed him battling for second place with Milan Bandić. The polls predicted Vesna Pusić and Dragan Primorac would be the only other candidates to pass 5% with each of them collecting 7% and 5% respectively. In 2007, during the parliamentary election, all exit polls predicted SDP would narrowly win, when in the reality HDZ turned out as the victor. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Andrija Hebrang expressed conviction that when actual results were published, he would overtake Bandić and qualify for second round.
