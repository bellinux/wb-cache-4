5|$|Seydlitz was {{repaired}} at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven from 25 January to 31 March 1915, {{after which}} she rejoined the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Bergen {{remained}} a quiet base {{during the first}} few years of the occupation, experiencing only one large Allied air attack. In 1943, the U-boat base added two new bunkers, U-Stützpunkt Prien and U-Stützpunkt Weddingen along with a shipyard named Danziger <b>Werft.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cormoran {{was built}} by the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. Her keel was laid in 1890 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 17 May 1892. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended the launching ceremony with the senior director of the Kaiserliche <b>Werft.</b> Work was completed by 25 July 1893, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. Following her commissioning, she underwent two months of sea trials, which were completed on 22 September. Starting in 1894, Cormoran was assigned to overseas service in Germany's colonial possessions. She was initially ordered on 2 October to the East Asia Station to replace the gunboat , but the rising tensions in South Africa led the Navy to send the new cruiser to German East Africa to secure German {{interests in the region}} instead.|$|E
5|$|The German {{companies}} Ingenieur Kontor Lübeck (IKL) and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche <b>Werft</b> (HDW) collaborated {{to offer}} an enlarged version of the Type 209 submarine, designated the Type 2000. Submarines based on the Type 209 design had been exported to several nations, but were not operated by the German Navy.|$|E
5|$|U-21 {{was built}} at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland). She was laid down in 1910 and {{launched}} on 8 February 1913. After fitting-out work was completed, she was commissioned into the fleet on 22 October 1913.|$|E
5|$|Blücher {{was built}} at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> {{shipyard}} in Kiel between 1907 and 1909, and commissioned on 1 October 1909. The ship served in the I Scouting Group {{for most of her}} career, including the early portion of World War I. She took part in the operation to bombard Yarmouth and the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in 1914.|$|E
5|$|SM U-21 was a U-boat {{built for}} the Imperial German Navy shortly before World War I. The third of four Type U-19-class submarines, these were the first U-boats in German service to be {{equipped}} with diesel engines. U-21 was built between 1910 and October 1913 at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. She was armed with four torpedo tubes and a single deck gun, though a second was added during her career.|$|E
5|$|The keel {{for the new}} cruiser {{was laid}} down on 28 March 1892 at the Schichau-Werke {{shipyard}} in Danzig, and the completed hull was launched on 31 March 1893. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended her launching, and the speech was given by {{the director of the}} Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig, Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Graf Kurt von Haugwitz. Sea trials began on 27 June 1894 at Kiel and lasted until 2 October. Serious defects in her design, in particular poor ventilation, were revealed through the trials, which necessitated modifications at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Kiel. She was accordingly placed in reserve after completing her trials. The work lasted until mid-1895, and the ship was ready for commissioning on 5 June 1895. That month, she was present for the celebration marking the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal.|$|E
5|$|U-2336 was the 16th U-boat {{that was}} {{constructed}} in the Type XXIII class. She was ordered on 20 September 1943, and was laid down on 27 July 1944 at Deutsche <b>Werft,</b> Hamburg, as yard number 490. She was launched on 10 September 1944 and commissioned {{under the command of}} Oberleutnant zur See Jürgen Vockel on 30 September of that year.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Norddeutsche Schiffbau-Gesellschaft yard in Kiel in 1881. She was {{launched}} on 26 August 1882 and commissioned into the German fleet on 28 March 1883. Pfeil was built by the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> shipyard in Wilhelmshaven. Her keel was laid down in 1881, she was launched on 16 September 1882, and commissioned into the German fleet on 25 November 1884. Both ships served in the fleet following their commissioning. Blitz was assigned as the flagship of the I Torpedo-boat Flotilla, while Pfeil initially served as a tender for the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Falke {{departed}} Montevideo {{and crossed}} the Atlantic to Dakar, proceeding to Las Palmas and then Lisbon. There she was visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. She arrived in Danzig on 15 April, after {{five and a half}} years abroad. The ship was decommissioned on 20 January, and an evaluation determined that she was not worth overhauling. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|She was {{decommissioned}} {{for a major}} reconstruction the day {{she returned}} to Germany. The work was done at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Wilhelmshaven from December 1901 to 1904. New, more powerful electrical generators were installed, the upper deck was enclosed, and the 10.5cm guns that had been located on the upper deck were moved to gun ports in the hull. The two 5cm guns that were located abreast of the center funnel were moved further aft, to the third funnel. After completion of the work, Gefion was left out of service in reserve. Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Admiralstab ordered Gefion to be reactivated, and on 10 August Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Waldeyer was placed {{in command of the}} ship. A crew could not be assembled due to shortages in personnel, however, and so the ship could not be placed back into service. Waldeyer was therefore transferred to another ship on 21 August. Gefion was thereafter moved to Danzig in 1916 for use as a barracks ship for crews of warships being repaired at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> there. She remained there {{for the duration of the}} war, and was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919.|$|E
5|$|The U-boat base at Bergen grew {{exponentially}} {{after the}} liberation of France by the Western Allies, when the senior commanding officer of U-boat operations in the west ("FdU West") was moved from Angers, France to the city. A large expansion program was conducted at the base and several new anti-aircraft guns were set up to protect the U-boat bunkers. More engineers and technicians were moved to Bergen to accommodate the increased technical requirements of the base as well. Two more bunkers named <b>Werft</b> Gemeinschaftslager 1 and Gemeinschaftslager 2 were also built during this time.|$|E
5|$|Zmaj {{was built}} by Deutsche <b>Werft</b> in Hamburg, Germany. Due to the {{restrictions}} of the Versailles Treaty, {{she had to be}} built as an unarmed auxiliary. Her keel was laid down in 1928 and she was launched on 22 June 1929. While en route to Yugoslavia she had a severe engine fire on 9 September 1929 off Flushing, Netherlands and was forced to return to Hamburg for repairs. These took almost a year and she was accepted by the Royal Yugoslav Navy on 20 August 1930. She was finally commissioned in 1931 after she was armed and finished fitting-out in Kotor.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} service, Nautilus and Albatross alternated between {{service with}} the High Seas Fleet; Nautilus {{participated in the}} annual fleet maneuvers in 1907 and 1908, {{and was replaced by}} Albatross thereafter. Nautilus was modernized at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel in 190910, and Albatross underwent a similar modernization there in 191011. While Albatross was out of service, Nautilus temporarily returned to the fleet. Once the former's refit was completed in 1911, the latter was transferred to mine warfare training in the North Sea before being decommissioned {{at the end of the}} year. Albatross remained in service through 1914, but apart from a collision with the steamer , the time passed uneventfully.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1909, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{decommissioned}} {{and assigned}} to the Reserve Division in the Baltic Sea. By that time, the new dreadnought battleships, which rendered Kaiser Barbarossa and her sister ships thoroughly obsolete, were beginning to come into service with the fleet. In early 1910, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{assigned to the}} Training Squadron, which operated in the Baltic in April. She was reactivated to participate in the autumn maneuvers that year in the provisional III Squadron; after the conclusion of the exercises on 10 September, she was placed back in reserve. More modernization work was done at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Kiel. From 31 July to 15 September, she was reactivated again {{to take part in the}} autumn maneuvers in the III Squadron. She thereafter returned to the Reserve Division in early 1912.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1906, Wörth was {{transferred}} to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She initially served as the flagship of the unit, but on 1 October she was replaced by Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. She was then decommissioned and her crew reduced to only a maintenance staff. Over the next eight years, she was reactivated only twice, from 2 August to 13 September in 1910 and from 31 July to 15 September the following year; both periods were during the annual autumn maneuvers. She served with the III Squadron in both exercises, and was the flagship of the second command admiral for the squadron, Konteradmiral Heinrich Sass. She returned to reserve status on 15 September, and a month later was docked in the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Kiel to maintain her for future service.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Emden, ordered as ersatz (replacement) , {{was placed on}} 6 April 1906 at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Dockyard) in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland). Her keel was laid down on 1 November 1906. She was launched on 26 May 1908 and christened by the Oberbürgermeister (Lord Mayor) of her namesake city, Dr. Leo Fürbringer. After fitting-out work was completed by 10 July 1909, she was commissioned into the fleet. The new cruiser began her sea trials that day; they were interrupted from 11 August to 5 September when she participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the main fleet. During this period, she also served as the escort for Kaiser Wilhelm II aboard his yacht Hohenzollern. Emden was decommissioned in September after she completed her trials.|$|E
5|$|A shorter {{period of}} {{dockyard}} work took place from 7 December to 27 January 1908. She {{returned to the}} fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises, and after {{the conclusion of the}} autumn maneuvers, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September. She was taken into the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910. During the refit, four of the ship's 15cm guns and the stern-mounted torpedo tube were removed. Two 8.8cm guns were added and the arrangement of the 8.8cm battery was modified. Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively, and the ship's funnels were lengthened. After reconstruction, the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic, along with her sister ships. She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to the III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises, then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division. She remained there {{for the rest of her}} peacetime career.|$|E
5|$|Condor {{was ordered}} as a {{replacement}} for the gunboat , which had been sunk by the hurricane that hit Apia in 1889. She was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1891. An outbreak of Cholera in Hamburg made work on the ship difficult, but the completed hull was nevertheless ready for launching as scheduled, on 23 February 1892. Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Wilhelm Schröder, the Chief of the Baltic Station, gave the speech at her launching, and she was christened by Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) von Bodenhausen, the director of the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven. The ship accidentally launched itself due to the tide coming earlier than expected. She was completed on 9 December of that year, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy; precautions against cholera delayed the beginning of sea trials until 15 December.|$|E
5|$|Four {{ships of}} the class were ordered, under the {{provisional}} names Ersatz Siegfried (Helgoland), Ersatz Oldenburg (Ostfriesland), Ersatz Beowulf (Thüringen), and Ersatz Frithjof (Oldenburg), as replacements for three of the coastal defense ships of the Siegfried-class, and the unique coastal defense ship SMS Oldenburg. SMS Helgoland was built at Howaldtswerke, Kiel. She was laid down on 11 November 1908, launched 25 September 1909, and commissioned nearly two years later on 23 August 1911. SMS Ostfriesland was built at Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> Wilhelmshaven. She was laid down 19 October 1908, launched five days after her sister Helgoland, on 30 September 1909, and commissioned 1 August 1911. SMS Thüringen was built by AG Weser in Bremen. She was laid down on 2 November 1908, launched on 27 November 1909, and commissioned on 1 July 1911. SMS Oldenburg, the final vessel, was built by Schichau in Danzig; she was laid down 1 March 1909, launched 30 June 1910, and commissioned on 1 May 1912.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, she again {{visited the}} Bismarck Archipelago and the Marshall Islands. Further repairs were {{effected}} in Sydney, and the cruiser {{was back in}} Apia by 18 August. Another tour of Germany's colonies began on 23 September. She returned to Sydney for periodic maintenance in mid-March 1903, and there she received the order to return to Germany. Cormoran departed Sydney on 23 May, bound for Germany; she reached Kiel on 13 September. While in Germany, she served {{a stint in the}} main fleet. The ship was modernized during a lengthy reconstruction that started in 1907 at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Danzig. New boilers manufactured by J W Klawitter in Danzig were installed, and her sailing rig was reduced. A new, larger conning tower was also installed. Work was completed in 1908, and on 1 May 1909, Cormoran was recommissioned for service in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January, Seeadler {{departed}} for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired {{in a major}} overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Kiel were sent to do the work. Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving in East Africa on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific. The {{rest of the year}} was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments in East Africa. The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with the investment of 500million gold marks in the country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained in East Africa while tensions cooled. In mid-February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.|$|E
5|$|She {{arrived in}} Chinese waters in late September, and was {{assigned}} to the blockade of the mouth of the Yangtze. She spent the period from 14 February to 3 March 1901 in the German concession at Tsingtao, after which she returned to the Yangtze. The blockade of the river ended in June, and on 10 June she returned to Tsingtao. From 4 September to 11 November, she underwent an overhaul in Shanghai. She then returned to Tsingtao and the Yangtze area, before riots in Zhejiang province forced her to steam to Ningpo to assist in suppressing the unrest on 9 April 1902. On 16 April, she left for repairs at Shanghai. On 23 July, while Schwalbe was moored in Tsingtao, she received the order to return to Germany. On 16 August, she departed Tsingtao and arrived in Danzig on 10 December. There, she was decommissioned a second time three days later. Another lengthy overhaul followed, which lasted from 1903 to 1905 at the Kaiserliche <b>Werft</b> in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|Comet was recommissioned in 1869 {{to perform}} the same duties as in the {{previous}} year; 1870 followed the same pattern as well, until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July interrupted Comets activities. On 16 July, Comet was assigned to the defense force in the Jade Bay outside Wilhelmshaven, but she saw no action during the conflict. She was decommissioned on 29 April 1871, at which point an investigation of her hull revealed the necessity of a major overhaul, which was done at the Königliche <b>Werft</b> in Danzig. Work ended in May 1872. In December, Comet was sent into the Baltic to search for vessels that had been wrecked in a severe storm, and if necessary, sink them to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards. She returned to Kiel without having located any wrecks on 31 December, in advance of the heavy sea ice that occurred in the Baltic every winter. Admiral Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the German admiralty, did not consider Comet to have sufficiently performed her duties, and so he relieved her captain of his command. With a new commander, Comet was sent out again on 5 January 1873, and this time did succeed in finding and sinking several wrecked vessels. After returning to Kiel on 24 January, she was decommissioned, but was temporarily recommissioned from 5 to 20 March for another patrol in the Baltic for wrecked ships. During this period, a detachment from the Torpedo Division based in Wilhelmshaven came aboard the vessel to test their new towed torpedoes. On 12 March, while cruising north of Cape Arkona, Comet encountered a wrecked vessel and was able to sink it with one of the torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|The Hamburg Atlantic Line {{had begun}} {{operations}} in 1958, operating the former Canadian Pacific liner Empress of Scotland {{as the first}} SS Hanseatic on a route connecting Cuxhaven, Germany to New York City. In 1965 the company decided to order a replacement for Hanseatic. In order to finance this, a new company German Atlantic Line was founded and shares of the new company were offered to past Hamburg Atlantic Line passengers. The unusual scheme was successful, and an order was placed for the new ship at Deutsche <b>Werft,</b> Hamburg in November 1966. Before the ship was delivered, Deutsche <b>Werft</b> merged with Howaldtswerke to form Howaldtswerke-Deutsche <b>Werft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} built in 1922 by Deutsche <b>Werft</b> AG, Hamburg, as yard number 19.|$|E
25|$|The Lloyd <b>Werft</b> in Bremerhaven, {{with its}} {{headquarters}} in the former laundry facility, continues {{the memory of the}} NDL.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic design}} of the new {{building}} was apparently successful, as even before she was completed SF Line's fellow Viking Line members Rederi AB Slite and Rederi Ab Sally asked access to the ship's plans {{so that they could}} order additional ships of the same design. However, in the end Slite opted to order a slightly larger vessel from Meyer <b>Werft</b> in Germany, while SF Line refused to give Sally access to the new ship's plans and as a result Sally too placed an order with Meyer <b>Werft.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aurora {{was built}} by Meyer <b>Werft</b> in Germany. Her keel was laid in December 1998 and she was {{launched}} in January 2000. She was delivered to P Cruises in April 2000..|$|E
25|$|At {{least the}} {{following}} major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fläkt Woods, Meyer <b>Werft,</b> Orion Corporation and Wärtsilä.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to lack of}} new-building capacity, TUI Cruises {{started by}} {{acquiring}} the cruise ship Celebrity Galaxy, which was built by Meyer <b>Werft</b> and was owned by another RCCL subsidiary, Celebrity Cruises. She left the Celebrity fleet on 16 March 2009. After acquiring Celebrity Galaxy, the ship headed to Lloyd <b>Werft</b> shipyards in Bremerhaven, Germany. She arrived on 27 March 2009, and received a €50 Million, 38-day conversion to upgrade her facilities to suit a German-speaking market. After the conversion, she was re-christened on 15 May 2009 in Hamburg, Germany bearing her new name, Mein Schiff (My Ship). TUI planned to build two 2,500-passenger, 100,000-GT cruise ships in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} {{design of}} Europa {{is very similar}} to the Astor of Hadag Cruise Line (as of 2008 sailing as Astoria for Transocean Tours), built {{at the same time as}} Europa by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche <b>Werft</b> at its yard at Hamburg.|$|E
25|$|The first Solstice-class {{vessel was}} ordered in year 2005 at Meyer <b>Werft,</b> with one vessel {{as the first}} option. Later, option for second vessel was exercised. Meyer <b>Werft</b> reached several {{milestones}} in their career while building the Solstice-class. It was their first time to build 122,000-GT cruise ships having post-Panamax dimensions. By that time, the class were the largest cruise ships ever built at the facility. On February and July 2006, the second and the third vessel was ordered respectively. The order for {{the fourth and fifth}} ship followed in 2007 and 2008. The class consists of five ships, with expected delivery of one ship each year, from 2008 to 2012, at a total cost of USD 3.7 billion.|$|E
25|$|She {{was ordered}} on 2 April 1942, and was laid down on 20 April 1943, at Neptun <b>Werft</b> AG, Rostock, as yard number 517. She was {{commissioned}} {{under the command}} of Oberleutnant zur See Werner Schulz on 6 December 1944.|$|E
25|$|The Sea Wolf class missile gunboats were {{acquired}} in 1968, {{based on the}} TNC 45 design from Fredrich Lürssen <b>Werft.</b> The first two gunboats were constructed in Germany, while the remaining four were constructed locally by ST Marine (then known as Singapore Shipbuilding and Engineering).|$|E
