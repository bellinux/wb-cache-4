This approach [...] "incorporates targeted speech production practice into phonological awareness activities and uses letters and phonological cues to prompt speech production". McNeill, Gillon, & Dodd studied 12 children ages 4-7 with DVD/CAS who were treated with this approach 2x a week for two 6-week blocks of time (separated by a 6-week <b>withdrawal</b> <b>block).</b> They found positive effects for most {{of the children in the}} areas of speech production, phonological awareness, word decoding, letter knowledge, and spelling.

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} can {{be defined}} by a three-stage cycle – binge/intoxication, with-drawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation – that involves allostatic changes in the brain reward and stress systems.

The negative emotional state that drives negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in the brain reward and stress systems.

40|$|Children with {{childhood}} apraxia {{of speech}} (CAS) {{are likely to}} experience severe and persistent spoken and written language disorder. There is a scarcity of intervention research, however, investigating techniques to improve the speech and literacy outcomes of this population. The series of 5 experiments reported in this thesis investigated phonological awareness and early reading development in children with CAS and trialled a new intervention designed to advance the spoken and written language development of those affected. In the first experiment (presented in Chapter 2), a comparison of 12 children with CAS, 12 children with inconsistent speech disorder (ISD), and 12 children with typical speech-language development (TD) revealed that children with CAS may be particularly susceptible to phonological awareness and reading deficits. There {{was no difference in}} the articulatory consistency and speech severity of the CAS and ISD groups, and no difference in the receptive vocabulary of the CAS, ISD, and TD groups. The children with CAS exhibited poorer phonological awareness scores than the comparison groups and had a greater percentage of participants performing below the expected range for their age on letter knowledge, real word decoding, and phonological awareness normative measures. The children with CAS and ISD performed inferiorly than the children with TD on a receptive phonological representation task. The results showed that the children with CAS had a representational component to their disorder that needed to be addressed in intervention. In the second experiment (presented in Chapter 3), a follow-up pilot study was conducted to examine the long-term effects of a previously conducted intensive integrated phonological awareness programme (7 hours of intervention over 3 weeks) on 2 children with CAS. The children aged 7; 3 and 8; 3 at follow-up assessment had previously responded positively to the intervention. Results showed that the children were able to maintain their high accuracy in targeted speech repeated measures over the follow-up period. One child was also able to maintain her high accuracy in phonological awareness repeated measures. The children performed superiorly on a standardised phonological awareness measure at follow-up than at pre-intervention. Non-word reading ability showed a sharp increase during the intervention period, while minimal gains were made in this measure over the follow-up period. The findings suggested that an integrated intervention was a potential therapeutic approach for children with CAS. In the third experiment (presented in Chapter 4), the effectiveness of an integrated phonological awareness programme was evaluated for the 12 children (identified in the first experiment) aged 4 to 7 years with CAS. A controlled multiple single-subject design with repeated measures was employed to analyse change in trained and untrained speech and phoneme segmentation targets. A comparative group design was used to evaluate the phonological awareness, reading, and spelling development of the children with CAS compared to their peers with TD over the intervention. The children participated in two 6 - week intervention blocks (2 -sessions per week) separated by a 6 -week <b>withdrawal</b> <b>block.</b> Seven children with CAS made significant gains in their production of trained and untrained speech words with 7 of these children demonstrating transfer of skills to connected speech for at least one target. Ten children showed significant gains in phoneme awareness, and 8 of these children demonstrated transfer of skills to novel phoneme awareness tasks. As a group, the children with CAS demonstrated accelerated development over the intervention period in letter knowledge, phonological awareness, word decoding, and spelling ability compared to their peers with typical development. In the fourth experiment (presented in Chapter 5), the speech, phonological awareness, reading, and spelling skills of children with CAS and TD were re-evaluated 6 - months following completion of the intervention programme. A measure of reading accuracy and reading comprehension in a text reading task was administered to the children with CAS. There was no difference in the performance of the children with CAS in post-intervention and follow-up assessments. The children with CAS and children with TD presented with similar relative change in phonological awareness, reading, and decoding measures over the follow-up period. The connected reading performance of children with CAS mirrored their phonological awareness and decoding skills. The findings demonstrated that children with CAS were able to maintain gains achieved during the intervention but may need further support to promote sustained development in written language. In the fifth experiment (presented in Chapter 6), the long-term effects of the integrated phonological awareness programme for identical twin boys who participated in the research intervention at pre-school were examined. The study examined Theo and Jamie's spoken language, phonological awareness, reading, and spelling development during their first year of schooling. The results pointed to the benefit of providing phonological awareness within a preventative framework for children with CAS. Theo and Jamie experienced continued growth in speech and phonological awareness skills. They exhibited age-appropriate reading and spelling development during their first year of formal literacy instruction. It was concluded from this series of experiments that children with CAS are particularly vulnerable to phonological awareness and early reading difficulty, and that an integrated phonological awareness intervention is an effective means of developing speech, phonological awareness, reading, and spelling skills in most children with CAS. The intervention appears to target processes underlying spoken and written language development in this population. The results are discussed within a phonological representation deficit hypothesis of CAS and clinical implications of the findings are highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Oxygen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>blocks</b> {{mitochondrial}} respiration. In rat hippocampal slices, this {{triggers a}} massive depolarization of CA 1 neurons and a negative {{shift of the}} extracellular DC potential, the characteristic sign of hypoxia-induced spreading depression (HSD). To unveil the contribution of mitochondria to the sensing of hypoxia and the ignition of HSD, we modified mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial uncoupling by carbonyl cyanide 4 -(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 1 mu M) prior to hypoxia hastened the onset and shortened the duration of HSD. Blocking mitochondrial ATP synthesis by oligomycin (10 mu g/ml) was without effect. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone (20 mu M), diphenyleneiodonium (25 mu M), or antimycin A (20 mu M) also hastened HSD onset and shortened HSD duration. 3 -nitropropionic acid (1 mM) increased HSD duration. Cyanide (100 mu M) hastened HSD onset and increased HSD duration. At higher concentrations, cyanide (1 mM), azide (2 mM), and FCCP (10 mu M) triggered SD episodes on their own. Compared with control HSD, the spatial extent of the intrinsic optical signals of cyanide- and azide-induced SDs was more pronounced. Monitoring NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) autofluorescence and mitochondrial membrane potential verified the mitochondrial targeting by the drugs used. Except 1 mM cyanide, no treatment reduced cellular ATP levels severely and no correlation was found between ATP, NADH, or FAD levels and the time to HSD onset. Therefore ATP depletion or a cytosolic reducing shift due to NADH/FADH(2) accumulation cannot serve as a general explanation for the hastening of HSD onset on mitochondrial inhibition. Additional redox couples (glutathione) or events downstream of the mitochondrial depolarization need to be considered. status: publishe...|$|R

Since arachidonic acid is released by the enzyme phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) in the present paper we evaluate whether dexamethasone effect may by related to inhibition of PLA 2 activity. Therefore, the effect of a neutralizing anti-lipocortin- 1 antibody and a polyclonal anti-type II extracellular phospholipase A 2 antibody on the opiate withdrawal in vitro was considered. Following a 4 min in vitro exposure to morphine a strong contracture of guinea-pig isolated ileum was observed after the addition of naloxone.

40|$|Anxiety {{has been}} {{indicated}} {{as a key}} symptom of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome and {{is considered to be}} one of the most important factors in cultivating the repetitive cycle of chronic cocaine abuse. Cocaine use and withdrawal from cocaine causes alterations in norepinephrine transmission and an associated vulnerability to anxiety. As alterations in noradrenergic transmission in limbic areas underlie withdrawal for many drugs of abuse, the initial goal of the present study sought to determine the effect of cocaine withdrawal on adrenergic receptor expression in the amygdala. ^ Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days and underwent either a no, short-term (2 days) or intermediate-term (12 days) withdrawal period. Amygdala brain regions were micro-dissected from all of these animals and processed for Western blot analysis. Results from these experiments showed that â 1 –adrenergic receptor expression is significantly increased in amygdala extracts of animals following short-term withdrawal compared to controls. This finding motivated further experiments toward determining whether treatment with betaxolol, a selective β 1 –adrenergic receptor antagonist, could ameliorate cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety. Therefore, in additional studies, at 24 and then 44 hours following chronic cocaine administration, animals were administered betaxolol (5 mg/kg, i. p.) and anxiety-like behavior in the animals was evaluated on the elevated plus maze test approximately 2 hours following the last betaxolol injection. Animals treated with betaxolol while undergoing withdrawal from chronic cocaine displayed a significant attenuation of anxiety-like behavior characterized by increased open arm exploration compared to control animals. ^ Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a peptide neurotransmitter, has also been implicated in mediating the ‘anxiety-like’ behavior that is observed during the initial phase of cocaine abstinence and an increase in amygdalar CRF gene expression has been found to specifically occur during short-term cocaine withdrawal. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, our studies confirmed these findings. Additionally, our anatomical data indicates direct inputs of noradrenergic afferents to CRF neurons in the amygdala and the presence of β 1 -adrenergic receptors on these neurons. ^ Modulation of adrenergic receptors eventually culminates in alterations in downstream signal transduction elements and using Western blot analysis, we also found alterations in a β 1 -adrenergic receptor-mediated cell signaling pathway during early cocaine withdrawal. Betaxolol treatment during early <b>withdrawal</b> <b>blocked</b> increases in CRF gene expression and reversed alterations in the signaling elements to control levels. Together, data from these studies suggest that the effect of betaxolol on ameliorating cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety may be related to its effect on blocking amygdalar β 1 -adrenergic receptors that are upregulated during early phases of drug withdrawal and hence, modulating downstream cell signaling elements and ultimately CRF gene expression. ...|$|R

Nicotine acts on these receptors to facilitate neurotransmitter release (dopamine and others), producing pleasure and mood modulation. Repeated exposure to nicotine develops neuroadaptation of the receptors, resulting in tolerance to many of the effects of nicotine. Withdrawal symptoms appear on stoppage of tobacco use, which are characterized by irritability, anxiety, increased eating, dysphoria, and hedonic dysregulation, among others.

AP 1 DNA binding activity increased upon withdrawal of HCD 57 cells from EPO. A dominant negative AP 1 mutant rendered these cells resistant to apoptosis induced by EPO <b>withdrawal</b> and <b>blocked</b> the downregulation of Bcl-XL. JunB is a major binding protein in the AP 1 complex observed upon EPO withdrawal; JunB but not c-Jun was present in the AP 1 complex 3 h after EPO withdrawal in HCD 57 cells, with a concurrent increase in junB message and protein. Furthermore, analysis of AP 1 DNA binding activity in an apoptosis-resistant subclone of HCD 57 revealed a lack of induction in AP 1 DNA binding activity and no change in junB mRNA levels upon EPO withdrawal. In addition, we determined that c-Jun and AP 1 activities correlated with EPO-induced proliferation and/or protection from apoptosis. AP 1 DNA binding activity increased over the first 3 h following EPO stimulation of HCD 57 cells, and suppression of AP 1 activity partially inhibited EPO-induced proliferation. c-Jun but not JunB was present in the AP 1 complex 3 h after EPO addition.

In the present study, we demonstrate that systemic treatment with estradiol or testosterone markedly decreases the latency of the foot withdrawal in the hot water test. A simultaneous treatment with an aromatase inhibitor blocks the effects of testosterone demonstrating, hence, that they are mediated by a conversion of testosterone into an estrogen by aromatase. Furthermore, the testosterone- or estradiol-induced decrease in foot <b>withdrawal</b> latency is <b>blocked</b> by a treatment with the estradiol receptor antagonist, tamoxifen, indicating that the effects are largely mediated by the interaction of estradiol with estrogen receptors. Together, {{these data suggest that}} sex steroids modulate sensitivity to noxious stimuli possibly by a direct action {{at the level of the}} dorsal hom of the spinal cord. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Sympathetic neurons die by {{apoptosis}} {{when they}} are deprived of nerve growth factor (NGF). Activation of caspases by cytochrome c released from mitochondria is central to this death. In this report we present evidence that cellular redox state regulates cytochrome c redistribution in these neurons. An increase of mitochondrial-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurred in rat sympathetic neurons in cell culture within 3 hr of NGF <b>withdrawal.</b> Caspase inhibitors <b>blocked</b> this ROS burst. By 6 hr after NGF deprivation, glutathione (GSH) levels had increased, neutralizing elevated hydrogen peroxide levels and returning cellular redox state to basal levels. By 12 hr after deprivation, ROS levels had again increased and remained elevated {{during the rest of}} the apoptotic process. The later ROS burst appeared to have both caspase-dependent and caspaseindependent components and was coincident with the period of cytochrome c release. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) and treatment with the antioxidant compound, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (L-NAC), blocked both the early and late ROS bursts by increasing cellular GSH levels (Ratan et al., 1994; Tan et al., 1998). Both compounds, and a membranepermeant form of GSH, also inhibited cytochrome c release an...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: It has {{previously}} been shown that drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that inhibit seizure activity during ethanol withdrawal, fail to alleviate the potentiated withdrawal seen following repeated episodes of withdrawal when administered during each withdrawal episode. Acute administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor competitive antagonist, CGP 39551, {{has been shown to}} inhibit seizure activity during ethanol withdrawal, and, when administered during the periods of repeated diazepam <b>withdrawal,</b> it <b>blocked</b> the reduction in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure threshold seen following a final, untreated withdrawal. Objectives: The aim of the current study was to determine if CGP 39551 could alter final ethanol-withdrawal symptoms when administered during the acute intermittent withdrawal periods. Methods: Mice were chronically treated with ethanol-containing liquid diet for either 30 days continuously (single withdrawal) or with 8 -h withdrawal periods on day 16 and day 23 of treatment (repeated withdrawal). Control animals received a control diet for the same period of time. On the final withdrawal animals were tested for behavioural signs of withdrawal. The effect of CGP 39551 administered acutely on withdrawal [up to 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i. p.) ] or during the intermittent withdrawal periods (10 mg/kg, i. p.) was examined. Results: Acute administration of CGP 39551 failed to inhibit handling-induced convulsions in the single-withdrawal or repeated-withdrawal group and had no effect on either decreased exploration or increased sensitivity to PTZ seen in withdrawal. Surprisingly, when CGP 39551 was administered during periods of repeated ethanol withdrawal a potentiation of seizure activity was seen in the final, untreated withdrawal. This potentiation of seizure activity, compared with vehicle-treated animals, was not seen when CGP 39551 was given whilst animals had access to ethanol (single-withdrawal group and repeated-withdrawal group where CGP 39551 treatment was non-contingent with withdrawal episodes). However, the decrease in exploration seen during withdrawal was potentiated in repeated-withdrawal animals treated with CGP 39551 irrespective of the time at which the CGP 39551 was administered. Conclusions: Treatment with an NMDA receptor-competitive antagonist potentiated the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome in animals with previous experience of ethanol withdrawal...|$|R
40|$|Nicotine sustains {{addictive}} tobacco use, {{which in}} turn causes much premature disability and death. The essence of drug addiction is loss of control of drug use. Molecular biology {{studies suggest that the}} 42 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype is the main receptor mediating nicotine dependence. Nicotine acts on these brain nicotinic cholinergic receptors to facilitate neurotransmitter release (dopamine and others), producing pleasure, stimulation, and mood modulation. Neuroadaptation develops with repeated exposure to nicotine, resulting in tolerance to many of the effects of nicotine. When a smoker stops smoking, a nicotine withdrawal syndrome ensues, characterized by irritability, anxiety, increased eating, dysphoria, and hedonic dysregulation, among other symptoms. Smoking is also reinforced by conditioning, such that specific stimuli that are psychologically associated with smoking become cues for an urge to smoke. These include the taste and smell of tobacco, as well as particular moods, situations, and environmental cues. Pharmacotherapies to aid smoking cessation should ideally reduce nicotine <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms and <b>block</b> the reinforcing effects of nicotine obtained from smoking without causing excessive adverse effects. Further, given the important role of sensory effects of smoking and psychoactive effects of nicotine, counseling and behavioral therapies are important adjuncts to and substantially augment the benefits of pharmacotherapy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{designed}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that neuronal-specific protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) plays a critical role in acute ethanol withdrawal hyper-responsiveness in spinal cord. Patch-clamp studies were carried out in motor neurons in neonatal rat spinal cord slices. Postsynaptic currents were evoked by brief pulses of 2 [*]mM N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) in the presence of bicuculline methiodide 10 [*]μM; strychnine 5 [*]μM and tetrodotoxin 0. 5 [*]μM. Both ethanol depression and withdrawal hyper-responsiveness of NMDA-evoked currents are dependent on increases in intracellular Ca 2 +. Blocking intracellular increase in Ca 2 + by 30 [*]mM 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) -ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) not only decreased the ethanol-induced depression of NMDA-evoked currents (33 ± 5 % in control vs 20 ± 3 % in BAPTA, P< 0. 05) but also eliminated acute ethanol withdrawal hyper-responsiveness. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that neonatal spinal cord motor neurons contain an abundance of nuclear PKCγ. Exposure to ethanol (100 [*]mM) induced PKCγ translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm in motor neurons. Pretreatment with the γ-isozyme-specific peptide PKC inhibitor, γV 5 - 3, blocked ethanol-induced translocation and also <b>blocked</b> <b>withdrawal</b> hyper-responsiveness. The results show that PKCγ mediates ethanol withdrawal hyper-responsiveness in spinal motor neurons; the results may be relevant to some symptoms of ethanol withdrawal in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanisms by which nutritionally-induced bodyweight differences(i. e. the so-called "static bodyweight effect") influence ovulation rate in sheep. Seventy Romney ewes (5 - 7 years old) were randomly divided into 2 groups of 35 each and differentially grazed on mixed ryegrass/white clover pastures for 12 - 16 weeks to generate two treatment groups differing in mean bodyweight by 14. 9 ± 1. 8 kg (mean± s. e. d.) early in the breeding season. Within each bodyweight (BWT) group, ewes were further divided into 3 blocks. Blocks 1 and 2 were used for the main experiment and only ovulation rate data were collected from ewes in block 3. The oestrous cycles of all ewes were synchronized by treatment for 14 days with progesterone-impregnated intravaginal sponges. Two weeks after sponge <b>withdrawal,</b> ewes in <b>block</b> 3 were subjected to laparoscopy to record their ovulation rate. After returning to oestrus following sponge <b>withdrawal,</b> ewes in <b>block</b> 1 and 2 were housed indoors and fed a maintenance diet of lucerne chaff until the end of the experiment about 16 days later. On day 12 of the synchronized oestrous cycle, ewes were injected with 150 vg cloprostenol to induce luteolysis. Laparotomies were performed at 0, 24, 48 (block 1 only), and 76 h after the prostaglandin treatment to study the patterns of preovulatory follicular development. The number of corpora lutea present on the ovaries at the time of the first laparotomy were also recorded. Ewes were blood-sampled by jugular venipuncture during the late luteal and follicular phases of the cycle and the plasma concentrations of FSH and LH were measured. After the laparotomy study, ovaries of the ewes were removed, fixed in Bouin's fluid and the left ovaries serially sectioned at 10 vm thickness. Every 5 th section was mounted and observed under a light microscope to study the populations of follicles 0. 2 mm or greater in diameter. Ewes in the high BWT group (H) had significantly higher ovulation rates than those in the low BWT group (L) (H= 1. 73 ± 0. 20, L= 1. 18 ± 0. 13, PO. lO). It is concluded that variation in ovulation rate due to nutritionally- induced bodyweight differences is associated with changes in the number of follicles being recruited into the actively growing pool shortly after luteolysis and the proportion of the recruited follicles that become atretic at the time of selection late in the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle. However, large differences in bodyweight do not appear to influence the antral follicle populations in the ovary. FSH, which plays many important roles during follicular development, may not be involved in the control of bodyweight-induced variation in ovulation rate...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, {{it has become clear}} that {{sphingolipids}} are sources of important signalling molecules. Particularly, the sphingolipid metabolites, ceramide and S 1 P, have emerged as a new class of potent bioactive molecules, implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation. Sphingomyelin (SM) is the major membrane sphingolipid and is the precursor for the bioactive products. Ceramide is formed from SM by the action of sphingomyelinases (SMase), however, ceramide can be very rapidly hydrolysed, by ceramidases to yield sphingosine, and sphingosine can be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase (SphK) to yield S 1 P. In immune cells, the sphingolipid metabolism is tightly related to the main stages of immune cell development, differentiation, activation, and proliferation, transduced into physiological responses such as survival, calcium mobilization, cytoskeletal reorganization and chemotaxis. Several biological effectors have been shown to promote the synthesis of S 1 P, including growth factors, cytokines, and antigen and G-protein-coupled receptor agonists. Interest in S 1 P focused recently on two distinct cellular actions of this lipid, namely its function as an intracellular second messenger, capable of triggering calcium release from internal stores, and as an extracellular ligand activating specific G protein-coupled receptors. Inhibition of SphK stimulation strongly reduced or even prevented cellular events triggered by several proinflammatory agonists, such as receptor-stimulated DNA synthesis, Ca 2 + mobilization, degranulation, chemotaxis and cytokine production. Another very important observation is the direct role played by S 1 P in chemotaxis, and cellular escape from apoptosis. As an extracellular mediator, several studies have now shown that S 1 P binds a number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) encoded by endothelial differentiation genes (EDG), collectively known as the S 1 P-receptors. Binding of S 1 P to these receptors trigger an wide range of cellular responses including proliferation, enhanced extracellular matrix assembly, stimulation of adherent junctions, formation of actin stress fibres, and inhibition of apoptosis induced by either ceramide or growth factor <b>withdrawal.</b> Moreover, <b>blocking</b> S 1 P 1 -receptor inhibits lymphocyte egress from lymphatic organs. This review summarises the evidence linking SphK signalling pathway to immune-cell activation and based on these data discuss the potential for targeting SphKs to suppress inflammation and other pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Withdrawal {{from chronic}} {{treatment}} with benzodiazepines {{is associated with}} increased neuronal excitability leading to anxiety, aversive effects and increased seizure sensitivity. After repeated withdrawal experiences, seizure sensitivity increases while withdrawal-induced anxiety and aversion decrease. We used autoradiographical methods employing [(3) H]Ro 48 8587, a selective ligand for glutamatergic alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionate (AMPA) receptors, to study withdrawal-induced changes in AMPA receptor binding {{in areas of the}} mouse brain postulated to be involved in these responses. Mice were given 21 days treatment with diazepam (15 mg/kg, s. c. in sesame oil) followed by withdrawal (single <b>withdrawal)</b> or three <b>blocks</b> of 7 days treatment interspersed with 3 -day periods to allow washout of drug (repeated withdrawal). In keeping with heightened excitability in withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment, the single withdrawal group showed, 72 h after their final dose of diazepam, increased [(3) H]Ro 48 8587 binding in several brain areas associated with emotional responses or seizure activity, including hippocampal subfields, amygdalar and thalamic nuclei and motor cortex. In contrast, the repeated withdrawal group showed no changes in [(3) H]Ro 48 8587 binding in any brain area studied. These observations are consistent with up-regulation of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission being important in withdrawal-induced anxiety and aversion but not in increased seizure sensitivity associated with repeated withdrawal. As changes in AMPA receptor subunit expression alter the functionality of the receptor, future studies will address this possibility...|$|R
