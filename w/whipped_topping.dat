40|$|Partial {{coalescence}} influences to a {{great extent}} the properties of final food products such as ice cream and <b>whipped</b> <b>toppings.</b> In return, the partial coalescence occurrence and development are conditioned, in such systems, by the emulsion's intrinsic properties (e. g. solid fat content, fat crystal shape and size), formulation (e. g. protein content, surfactants presence) and extrinsic factors (e. g. cooling rate, shearing). A set of methods is available for partial coalescence investigation and quantification. These methods are critically reviewed in this paper, balancing the weaknesses of themethods in terms of structure alteration (for turbidity, dye dilution, etc.) and assumptions made for mathematical models (for particle size determination) with their advantages (good repeatability, high sensitivity, etc.). With the methods proposed in literature, the partial coalescence investigations can be conducted quantitatively and/or qualitatively. Good correlation were observed between some of the quantitative methods such as dye dilution, calorimetry, fat particle size;while a poor correlation was found in the case of solvent extraction method with other quantitativemethods. The most suitableway for partial coalescence quantification was implied to be the fat particle size method, which would give results {{with a high degree of}} confidence if used in combination with a microscopic technique for the confirmation of partial coalescence as the main destabilization mechanism.

50|$|The {{implementation}} of a GFCF diet involves removing all sources of gluten and casein from a person's diet. Gluten is found in all products containing wheat, rye, and barley.

Casein is found in dairy products such as milk, butter or cheese, but is also present in smaller amounts in many substitute dairy products such as vegetarian cheese substitutes and <b>whipped</b> cream <b>topping,</b> which use casein to provide texture. Although advocates of the GFCF diet often recommend total elimination of dairy from the diet, whey protein is a different milk protein from casein.|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of the instability mechanism partial coalescence in oil-in-water food emulsions show a discrepancy. On the one hand, {{it needs to be}} avoided in order to achieve an extended shelf life in food products like sauces, creams and several milk products. On the other hand, during the manufacturing of products like ice cream. butter and <b>whipped</b> <b>toppings</b> partial coalescence is required to achieve the desired product properties. It contributes to the structure formation, the physicochemical properties (stability, firmness [...] ) and the sensory perception, like fattiness and creaminess of the final food products. This review critically summarises the findings of partial coalescence in oil-in-water emulsions in order to provide insight in how to enhance and retard it. Next to the pioneering work, a large set of experimental results of more recent work is discussed. First, the general mechanism of partial coalescence is considered and a distinction is made between partial and 'true' coalescence. The main differences are: the required solid particles in the dispersed oil phase, the formation of irregular clusters and the increased aggregation rate. Second, the kinetics of partial coalescence is discussed. In more detail, potential parameters affecting the rate of partial coalescence are considered by means of the encounter frequency and capture efficiency of the fat globules. The flow conditions, the fat volume fraction and the physicochemical properties of continuous aqueous phase affect both the encounter frequency and capture efficiency while the actual temperature, temperature history and the composition and formulation of the emulsion mainly affect the capture efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Artificial cream (or [...] "dessert topping") is an {{imitation}} of whipped cream containing some non-dairy fats. Examples are Cool Whip and Elmlea. Artificial cream is usually made from vegetable oil, not butterfat, and contains no butyric acid. However, most leading brands do contain dairy products and therefore are not suitable for vegans or people who avoid dairy because of dietary or religious reasons. Artificial cream often contains sugar or other sweeteners. Artificial cream is sold as <b>whipped,</b> ready-to-serve <b>topping</b> in plastic tubs and aerosol containers and {{in the form of}} powders which must be whipped with a liquid before use. Artificial cream {{can be used as a}} topping on pies, cakes and sundaes.|$|R
