For example, JPEG 2000 is an image compression standard that uses biorthogonal wavelets. This means that although the frame is overcomplete, it is a tight frame (see types of frames of a vector space), and the same frame functions (except for conjugation in the case of complex wavelets) are used for both analysis and synthesis, i.e., in both the forward and inverse transform.

As ZTE/modified SPIHT algorithm codes an image into multi-layer bitstreams, the base layer and enhancement layer bitstreams, it provides superior benefits to the retrieval system compared to other compression methods. Since the base layer bitstream is analogous to a thumbnail image, it eliminates the redundancy of data. Moreover, the enhancement layer bitstream also allows fast transmission that enhances the performance of retrieval systems.

50|$|While {{subsampling}} {{can easily}} {{reduce the size}} of an uncompressed image by 50% with minimal loss of quality, the final effect on the size of a compressed image is considerably less. This is because image compression algorithms also remove redundant chroma information. In fact, by applying something as rudimentary as chroma subsampling prior to compression, information is removed from the image that could be used by the compression algorithm to produce a higher quality result with no increase in size. For example, with <b>wavelet</b> <b>compression</b> methods, better results are obtained by dropping the highest frequency chroma layer inside the compression algorithm than by applying chroma subsampling prior to compression. This is because <b>wavelet</b> <b>compression</b> operates by repeatedly using wavelets as high and low pass filters to separate frequency bands in an image, and the wavelets do a better job than chroma subsampling does.|$|E
