500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see what you want, and how you want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E
