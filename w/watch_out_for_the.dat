5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Japanese and the other boats.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{maintained}} {{a fleet of}} Zeppelins that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids.

25|$|Gardiner {{maintains}} that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) {{was on the}} bridge because {{he was one of}} the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the Titanic did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the Titanic because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the Titanic.|$|E
500|$|Using John Wisdom's {{parable of}} the {{invisible}} gardener, Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable {{tells the story of}} two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected. Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a [...] "death by a thousand qualifications" [...] as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful. Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.|$|E
500|$|With {{his wife}} {{administering}} the campaign organization, Sunday {{was free to}} do what he did best: compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran from one end of the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era. A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote, [...] "Many of the things said and done bordered upon things prohibited in decent society. The sermon on amusements was preached three times, to mixed audience of men and women, boys and girls. If the sermons to women had been preached to married women, if the sermons to men had been preached to mature men, if the sermon on amusements had been preached to grown folks, there might have been an excuse for them, and perhaps good from them. But an experienced newspaper reporter told me that the sermon on amusements was 'the rawest thing ever put over in Syracuse.' I can not, must not, quote from this sermon...", [...] "fainted under that awful definition;", [...] "if you do not 'hit the trail' then <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fireworks"... says that Mr. Sunday's sermon on the sex question was raw and disgusting. He also heard the famous sermons on amusements and booze. [...] says that all in all they were the ugliest, nastiest, most disgusting addresses he ever listened to from a religious platform or a preacher of religion. He saw people carried out who had fainted under that awful definition of sensuality and depravity.|$|E

2500|$|The book five of {{the text}} is, like book four, a simpler {{compilation}} of moral-filled fables. These also present negative examples with consequences, offering examples and actions for the reader to ponder over, avoid, to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for.</b> <b>The</b> messages in this last book include those such as [...] "get facts, be patient, don't act in haste then regret later", [...] "don't build castles in the air". The book five is also unusual in that almost all its characters are humans, unlike the first four where the characters are predominantly anthropomorphized animals. According to Olivelle, this may be by design where the text's ancient author sought to bring the reader out of the fantasy world of talking and pondering animals into {{the realities of the}} human world.|$|E
2500|$|Political {{commentators}} took {{different views}} on the raids, with intelligence agencies researcher and journalist Nicky Hager suggesting the raids {{may have been the}} result of the increased police and SIS staffing and resources aimed at anti-terrorism since 2001. (The raids and the surveillance preceding them cost $8 million to plan and execute.) Veteran activist John Minto criticised the police for the move, claiming that their actions provoked a [...] "climate of fear and repression" [...] while left-leaning commentator and blogger Martyn [...] "Bomber" [...] Bradbury, sided with the police, saying that in his dealings with the activist community he had become concerned with the actions of [...] "some clowns." [...] The Herald was criticised for publishing these comments which did not mention who the [...] "clowns" [...] were or name the blog site Bradbury claimed to have communicated with them on. New Zealand Herald columnist Matt McCarten saw the raids as being over the top; [...] "Some of the young people I know who were arrested are actually vegans who don't even believe in killing animals, let alone human beings. When you get the police searching homes of environmental activists trying to save snails on the West Coast, you know that things have got really silly." [...] McCarten also stated that New Zealanders should be more worried about the country joining the US database of terrorist suspects, and [...] "the creeping powers of our secret police." [...] However the 'From the left' columnist for the Dominion Post, Chris Trotter reacted differently, saying [...] "it wasn't the actions of the police that provoked my fury, but of those who'd forced their hand." [...] When left-wing musician Don Franks wrote a protest song about the raids, [...] "Safer Communities Together Blues" [...] he took a swipe at Trotters reaction with the lyrics [...] "The political climate's getting hotter / Got to <b>watch</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pigs and the pigs' Trotter." ...|$|E
