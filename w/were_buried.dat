5|$|The {{kings of}} the first kingdom <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in Darib, while older kings <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in a royal {{mausoleum}} located in Binas and only one royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum G4). This first kingdom tomb was probably built {{during the reign of}} the last king and might be an indication of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions to bury the kings beneath their royal palaces.|$|E

5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 Japanese troops were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed Japanese troops <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of Japanese troops fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> by their fellow soldiers up in the island's peaks, and many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in group graves. Large holes of seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at the bottom of each of these holes to serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E

5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they <b>were</b> <b>buried,</b> or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they <b>were</b> <b>buried.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Maralinga cleanup {{operation}} codenamed Operation Brumby {{was conducted}} in 1967. Attempts were made to dilute the concentration of radioactive material by turning over and mixing the surface soil.

5|$|A {{cargo ship}} picked up {{eight of the}} {{aforementioned}} survivors from the Doña Marilyn; eleven other survivors were found on Maripipi Island and on a nearby inlet, ten were discovered on Sambawan Island, and four others were found floating in the water. In Almagro, 137survivors washed onshore on October25, 120ofwhom reached shore by either a life jacket or a life boat. Eighteen other survivors <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in a common grave in Almagro and nine other bodies, also found in Almagro, were shipped to Tacloban. In Tacloban, six other survivors <b>were</b> <b>buried,</b> but over 60survivors were also found on the island, and were transported on four buses and taken to receive medical treatment. Twenty-two were found on Samar Island, including two in Calbayog. Overall, the shipwreck was confirmed to have killed 77, even though 261others were listed missing.|$|E
50|$|The torc <b>was</b> <b>buried</b> deliberately, {{and as such}} is {{considered}} a hoarded object. It may have been broken when it <b>was</b> <b>buried,</b> or broken {{at a later date}} by ploughing. It is thought to have <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in about 75 BC.|$|R

5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E
5|$|As the New Kingdom crumbled, the {{building}} of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived. Some rulers of the Third Intermediate Period, such as those at Tanis, <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> within the enclosures of divine temples, thus continuing the close link between temple and tomb.|$|E
5|$|Bodies {{recovered}} were {{preserved and}} taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. A large temporary morgue {{was set up in}} a curling rink and undertakers were called in from all across Eastern Canada to assist. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim the bodies of their relatives. Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies, 121 were taken to the non-denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery; 19 <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery, and 10 were taken to the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery. Unidentified victims <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E
5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts were getting {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 <b>were</b> <b>buried</b> at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them <b>were</b> <b>buried.</b> Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
