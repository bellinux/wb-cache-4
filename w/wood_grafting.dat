40|$|Citrus Vein Phloem {{degeneration}} (CVPD) is {{an important}} citrus disese, which damaged citrus plantation and causing decrease of citrus production. In Indonesia, the CVPD disease caused by Liberobacter asiaticum bactery and the disease spread out by vectir insect Diaphorina citri and using infected bud in <b>wood</b> <b>grafting.</b> In infected citrus plant, two specific protein molecules with molecular weigt 16 kDa and 66 kDa are found. These protein molecules are not found in healthy citrus plant. The immunogenicity of PS 16 accumulated on leaf of citrus plant infected by CVPD is known yet. The research material were leaves of citrus plant infected CVPD, leaves of healthy citrus plant and reagent used these research are for isolation of the total protein leaf of citrus plant, SDS-PAGE electroforesis, electroelution of PS 16, ELISA Methods, Dot-Blot Method, anti-PS 16 as aprimery antibody and secondary antibody is anti-Rabbit IgG Conjugated AP. The result of the research showed that of PS 16 accumulated on leaf of citrus plant infected CVPD has immunogenic character. It is indicated by increase of the titer anti-PS 16 after first immunization ang 2 nd booster by indirect ELISA method {{and can be used}} to induce antibody (anti-PS 16) and so showed that positive reaction between PS 16 with anti-PS 16. It is indicated by purples dark blue on cellulose membrane by Dot Blot method. ...|$|E

40|$|Bleached {{kraft pulp}} was grafted with a {{hydrophobic}} polymer, i. e. poly (methyl methacrylate), using manganic pyrophosphate as initiator. Composites containing up to 50 % of <b>grafted</b> <b>wood</b> pulp with LDPE were prepared and tested for mechanical and thermal properties. A {{small amount of}} functionalized LDPE, i. e. poly(ethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate), {{was added to the}} composite to improve compatibility between the two immiscible phases. The impact strength and tensile strength were considerably improved due to the addition of compatibilizer. SEM micrographs revealed the presence of greater interaction between the two components for compatibilized composites. Thermogravimetric analysis showed greater stability for the compatibilized composites, while DSC studies revealed the lowering of crystallinity for the LDPE phase...|$|R
30|$|In this study, a facile {{one-step}} {{synthesis of}} a novel nanocomposite catalytic film was developed based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) immobilized in tannic acid-modified eggshell membrane (Tan-ESM). Tannic acid, as a typical plant polyphenol from oak <b>wood,</b> was first <b>grafted</b> onto ESM fibers to serve as both the reductant and the stabilizer during the synthesis of AgNPs. The morphology, constitution, and thermal stability of the resulting AgNPs@Tan-ESM composites were fully characterized to explain the excellent catalytic efficiency of AgNPs@Tan-ESM composites. These composite catalysts were applied to the degradation of azo dyes which exhibited the high catalytic activity toward Congo red and methyl orange according to the kinetic curves. More importantly, they can be easily recovered and reused for many times because of their good stability.|$|R
50|$|The trees {{thrived in}} the {{southern}} California climate and the navel orange industry grew rapidly. Many growers purchased bud <b>wood</b> and then <b>grafted</b> the cuttings to root stock. Within a few years, the successful cultivation of many thousands of the newly discovered Brazilian navel orange led to a California Gold Rush of a different kind: {{the establishment of the}} citrus industry, which is commemorated in the landscapes and exhibits of the California Citrus State Historic Park and the restored packing houses in the downtown's Marketplace district. By 1882, there were {{more than half a million}} citrus trees in California, almost half of which were in Riverside. The development of refrigerated railroad cars and innovative irrigation systems established Riverside as the richest city in the United States (in terms of income per capita) by 1895.|$|R

The loose bunches help to prevent Bunch rot, Powdery mildew and Downy mildew. Champanel grapes are also not susceptible to Pierce’s disease, which is a disease caused by the glassy-winged sharpshooter. This insect is native to southeast United States. The sharpshooter has the [...] "ability to spread Xylella fsatidoisa, the bacterium that causes Pierce’s disease" [...] (Power 148). The Champanel grapevine can thrive in the hot humid south and can tolerate temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below zero(Munson).

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to determine what, if any, role grapevine rhizosphere bacteria play in the differing susceptibilities of New Zealand grown rootstocks to Cylindrocarpon black foot disease. The size and diversity of bacterial populations associated with the rhizospheres of grapevine rootstocks: 101 - 14, 5 C, Schwarzmann and Riparia Gloire were evaluated. Dilution plating showed that total bacterial (P= 0. 012, P= 0. 005 for NA and KB, respectively) and fluorescent Pseudomonad (P= 0. 035) rhizosphere counts differed between rhizosphere and bulk soils but did not correlate with the differing susceptibilities of the rootstock varieties to black foot. No varietal differences were found for spore forming bacteria (P= 0. 201). SSCP banding patterns showed that species diversity was similar for most rootstocks, but that there were some differences in the composition of bacterial populations, probably attributable to vigour. Some functional characteristics of the bacteria isolated from the rhizospheres of the most and least susceptible rootstock varieties were assessed to investigate their potential to suppress the pathogen. In dual culture, bacteria from Riparia Gloire, 101 - 14 and the control soil all had little ability to antagonise Cylindrocarpon destructans. However, they differed in their degrees of activity for glucanase (P= 0. 000), protease (P= 0. 001) and siderophores (P= 0. 000). In all tests, bacterial isolates from the rhizosphere of 101 - 14 had the largest number of active isolates (P≤ 0. 002); however, those from Riparia Gloire had the greatest degree of positive responses for the glucanase and siderophore assays. Bacterial isolates from the control soil produced few glucanases and no siderophores, but had the highest degree of protease activity. Bands excised and sequenced from SSCP gels frequently matched to other ‘uncultured bacteria’ in GenBank, as well as to other bacterial phyla, classes and genera commonly isolated from soil and sediment samples. These included members of the Firmicutes, Proteobacteria (α, δ, γ), Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria and Chromatiales. The pathogenicity of C. destructans and Fusarium oxysporum was investigated by inoculating soil containing wounded ungrafted rootstocks of 101 - 14, 5 C, Schwarzmann and Riparia Gloire. Results indicated that F. oxysporum might be a more aggressive pathogen than C. destructans. Inoculation with F. oxysporum or C. destructans increased disease severity, P= 0. 018 and P= 0. 056, respectively at 0 cm. Rootstock variety influenced disease severity caused by C. destructans (P< 0. 001) and F. oxysporum (P= 0. 090), with rootstocks 101 - 14 and 5 C being most susceptible to C. destructans, and Riparia Gloire and Schwarzmann most susceptible to F. oxysporum. There was also an indication that inoculation with one pathogen increased plant susceptibility to the other, with increased F. oxysporum infection in the C. destructans inoculated treatments of Riparia Gloire and Schwarzmann (P< 0. 05). The effect of carbohydrate stress (leaf trimming) and inoculation on C. destructans disease severity, incidence, and rootstock rhizosphere bacterial populations was evaluated by inoculating the soil containing one year old plants of Sauvignon Blanc scion <b>wood</b> <b>grafted</b> to rootstocks 101 - 14 and Schwarzmann. Disease severity and incidence was similar for both Schwarzmann (8. 4 % and 29. 3 %, respectively) and 101 - 14 (14. 9 % and 31. 0 %, respectively). When data for the moderate and no stress treatments were combined, because their effects were similar, the disease severity was significantly higher for the highly stressed plants(P= 0. 043). Stress did not influence disease incidence (P= 0. 551). Infection occurred in the non-inoculated plants, but disease severity was higher in the plants inoculated with C. destructans than those that were not. Root dry weight of highly stressed plants was lower than in both the moderately stressed (P= 0. 000) and unstressed plants (P= 0. 003). An interaction between inoculation and stress (P= 0. 031) showed that inoculated and highly stressed plants had the lowest root dry weight but there was no effect of rootstocks (P= 0. 062). There was no significant effect of carbohydrate stress (P= 0. 259) or inoculation (P= 0. 885) on shoot dry weight. SSCP banding patterns showed that bacterial diversity was generally similar between rootstocks, but stress and inoculation altered rhizosphere bacterial communities. This study has demonstrated that functionality of grapevine rhizosphere bacteria do differ between grapevine rootstock varieties that have different susceptibilities to black foot disease, but that this role needs to be further investigated if more accurate and practically relevant conclusions are to be drawn...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose is {{a natural}} raw {{material}} recurring in a great quantity. The demand touse it more and more widely is increasing. The production of cellulose derivates started asearly as the 19 th century, however the modification of these materials meant the breakingup the fibrous structure, which made their use more difficult in paper industry. Themodified cellulose made by graft copolymerization, however, keeps its fibrous character,which provides a great advantage regarding its use. Grafting of industrial cellulose pulpwith vinyl-acetate allows {{for the production of}} <b>grafted</b> <b>wood</b> cellulose fibres that have athermoplastic layer on their surface. The binder fibre (fibrid) produced in this way can beexcellently used for producing synthetic papers. In the first part of my experiments I dealt with choosing the parameters of graftcopolymerization which are best suited to various uses and after that I studied thedependence of graft reaction on the composition and properties of industrial celluloseapplied. The selection of the suitable reaction parameters was followed by the study ofreaction speed and activation energy. I have stated that the gross reaction of graftingindustrial cellulose with vinyl-acetate monomer is a second order reaction, which is provenby the fact that the invert of the momentary monomer concentration of the system plottedagainst time is a linear function. The rise of the curves, that is, the reaction speed increaseswhen the temperature in the range of 293 – 323 K is increasing, while the average activationenergy decreases...|$|R
40|$|Given that nursery is a {{peculiar}} environment, {{the amount of}} nutrients removed by nursery trees represents a fundamental acquisition to optimise fertilisation strategies, with economic and environmental implications. In this context, we determined nutrient removal by apple, pear and cherry nursery trees {{at the end of}} the nursery growing cycle. We randomly removed 5 leafless apple (Golden Delicious/EMLA M 9; density of 30, 000 trees ha – 1), pear (Santa Maria/Adams; density of 30, 000 trees ha – 1) and cherry (Alex TM /Gisela 6 ®; density of 40, 000 trees ha – 1) trees from a commercial nursery. Trees were divided into roots (below the root collar), rootstock (above-ground wood between root collar and grafting point) and variety (1 -year-old <b>wood</b> above the <b>grafting</b> point). For each organ we determined biomass, macro- (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S,) and micro- (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B) nutrient concentration. Pear trees were the most developed (650 g (dw) tree – 1, equal to 1. 75 and 2. 78 folds than apple and cherry trees, respectively) whereas, independently of the species, variety mostly contributed (> 50 %) to the total tree biomass, followed by roots and then above-ground rootstock. However, the dry biomass and nutrient amount measured in rootstocks (including roots) represent the cumulative amount of 2 and 3 seasons, for Gisela ® 6 (tissue culture) and pome fruit species (generated by mound layering), respectively. Macro and micronutrients were mostly concentrated in roots, followed by variety and rootstock, irrespective of the species. Independently of the tissue, macronutrients concentration hierarchy was N>Ca>K> P>Mg>S. Removed N by whole tree accounted for 6. 58, 3. 53 and 2. 49 g tree – 1 for pear, apple and cherry, respectively, corresponding to almost 200, 107 and 100 kg N ha – 1, respectively. High amounts of K and Ca were used by pear (130 - 140 kg ha – 1) and apple trees (~ 50 and 130 kg ha – 1 of K and Ca, respectively), while ~ 25 kg K ha – 1 and 55 kg Ca ha – 1 were calculated for cherry nursery trees. Among micronutrients, Fe was the most required (~ 3 kg ha – 1) independently of the species. B removal ranged between 1. 2 and 2. 4 kg ha – 1 (80, 40 and 30 mg tree – 1 for pear, apple and cherry, respectively), whereas Mn, Cu and Zn accounted for few hundred g ha – 1, irrespective of the species. Given that nutrient concentration among tissues resulted within the same order of magnitude, irrespective of the species, differences in removal were mainly driven by the tree biomass as proved by the significant correlations between plant dry biomass with most of the nutrients we observed...|$|R
