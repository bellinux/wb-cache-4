5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> machines became commercially available. These {{are used}} alone {{to provide a}} pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional background music.

Also, <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.|$|E
5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited <b>white</b> <b>noise.</b> For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the Besov {{regularity}} of Lévy <b>white</b> <b>noises</b> on the d-dimensional torus. Due to their rough sample paths, the <b>white</b> <b>noises</b> that we consider {{are defined as}} generalized stochastic fields. We, initially, obtain regularity results for general Lévy <b>white</b> <b>noises.</b> Then, we focus on two subclasses of noises: compound Poisson and symmetric-α-stable (including Gaussian), for which we make more precise statements. Before measuring regularity, we show that the question is well-posed; we prove that Besov spaces are in the cylindrical σ-field of the space of generalized functions. These results {{pave the way to}} the characterization of the n-term wavelet approximation properties of stochastic processes. Comment: 24 page...|$|R

5|$|In 1989, Bowie {{created the}} rock group Tin Machine, who {{released}} a self-titled album with EMI. Although Tin Machine reached number {{three on the}} UK Albums Chart, it did not sell well and Bowie and EMI did not renew their contract. Tin Machine II followed in 1991 on London Records and, only reaching number 23 in the UK, was Bowie's worst-charting album since the 1973 re-release of The Man Who Sold the World. Continuing as a solo artist, Bowie's next album, Black Tie <b>White</b> <b>Noise</b> (1993), reached the number one position on the UK Albums Chart. Bowie released a further seven studio albums, {{all of which have}} reached the top ten in the UK. Released after a ten-year hiatus, The Next Day (2013) was Bowie's first UK chart-topping album since Black Tie <b>White</b> <b>Noise</b> (1993). Bowie released his final album, Blackstar on 8 January 2016, his 69th birthday and two days before his death on 10 January. The album debuted at number one in the UK and became Bowie's first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 in the US.|$|E

5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E

5|$|In {{support of}} this album, Bowie {{embarked}} on the Glass Spider Tour, a world tour that {{was at that point}} the biggest, most theatrical and most elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career. The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. Bowie did not release another solo album until Black Tie <b>White</b> <b>Noise</b> in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, Griffin {{became a}} {{political}} worker at the National Front headquarters. As a teenager he had accompanied {{his father to}} a National Front meeting, and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party. He helped set up the <b>White</b> <b>Noise</b> Music Club in 1979, and several years later worked with white power skinhead band, Skrewdriver. In 1980, he {{became a member of}} the party's governing body, the National Directorate, and in the same year launched Nationalism Today with the aid of Joe Pearce, then editor of the NF youth paper Bulldog. As a National Front member, Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in the 1981 by-election and 1983 general election, securing 1.2% and 0.9% of the vote.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{extension}} {{to the existing}} automatic pencil drawing generation technique based on Line Integral Convolution (LIC). The original LIC pencil filter utilizes image segmentation and texture direction detection techniques for defining outlines and stroke directions, {{and the quality of}} a resulting image depends largely on the result of the <b>white</b> <b>noises</b> and the texture directions. It may fail to generate a reasonable result when the <b>white</b> <b>noises</b> and the texture directions are not consistent with the texture structure of the input image. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper to improve the existed LIC-based method. First, a more accurate and rapid graphbased image segmentation method is introduced to divide the image into different regions. Second, we present a new region-based way to produce <b>white</b> <b>noises</b> and texture directions. We also demonstrate the enhanced LIC pencil drawing is closer to the real artistic style...|$|R

5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> crescendo.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E
