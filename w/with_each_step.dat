25|$|The American coot (Fulica americana), {{also known}} as a mud hen, is a bird of the family Rallidae. Though {{commonly}} mistaken to be ducks, American coots belong to a distinct order.

Coots live near water, typically inhabiting wetlands and open water bodies in North America. Groups of coots are called covers or rafts. The oldest known coot lived to be 22 years old.|$|E
500|$|The {{two basic}} {{categories}} of Tennessee Walking Horse show competition are called [...] "flat-shod" [...] and [...] "performance". Flat-shod horses compete {{in many different}} disciplines under both western and English tack.

[...] "Park pleasure" [...] is the most animated of the flat-shod divisions. Flat-shod horses are shown in ordinary horseshoes, and {{are not allowed to}} use pads or action devices, though their hooves are sometimes trimmed to a slightly lower angle with more natural toe than seen on stock horse breeds. Performance horses, sometimes called [...] "padded" [...] or [...] "built up", exhibit flashy and animated gaits, lifting their forelegs high off the ground <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>step.</b> This exaggerated action is sometimes called the [...] "Big Lick". [...] The customary style for rider attire and tack is saddle seat. [...] Horses are shod in double and triple-nailed pads, which are sometimes called [...] "stacks". This form of shoeing is prohibited at shows governed by the National Walking Horse Association (NWHA), and the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF).|$|E

500|$|A giraffe rests by lying {{with its}} body {{on top of}} its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers {{the rest of its}} body. To get back up, it first gets on its knees and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then {{straightens}} its front legs. <b>With</b> <b>each</b> <b>step,</b> the animal swings its head. In captivity, the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down, however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short [...] "deep sleep" [...] phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep. If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they could possibly float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the surface.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to find maximum-capacity paths and minimax paths with a single source and single destination very efficiently even in models of computation that allow only comparisons of the input graph's edge weights and not arithmetic on them. The algorithm maintains a set [...] of edges that are known to contain the bottleneck edge of the optimal path; initially, [...] is just the set of all [...] edges of the graph. At each iteration of the algorithm, it splits [...] into an ordered sequence of subsets [...] of approximately equal size; the number of subsets in this partition is chosen {{in such a way}} that all of the split points between subsets can be found by repeated median-finding in time [...] The algorithm then reweights each edge of the graph by the index of the subset containing the edge, and uses the modified Dijkstra algorithm on the reweighted graph; based on the results of this computation, it can determine in linear time which of the subsets contains the bottleneck edge weight. It then replaces [...] by the subset [...] that it has determined to contain the bottleneck weight, and starts the next iteration with this new set. The number of subsets into which [...] can be split increases exponentially <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>step,</b> so the number of iterations is proportional to the iterated logarithm function, , and the total time is [...] In a model of computation where each edge weight is a machine integer, the use of repeated bisection in this algorithm can be replaced by a list-splitting technique of , allowing [...] to be split into [...] smaller sets [...] in a single step and leading to a linear overall time bound.|$|E
2500|$|Walking (also {{known as}} ambulation) {{is one of}} the main gaits of {{locomotion}} among legged animals. Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. [...] Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>step.</b> This applies regardless of the number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight or more limbs, walk.|$|E

2500|$|Walking is {{characterized}} by an [...] "inverted pendulum" [...] movement in which {{the center of gravity}} vaults over a stiff leg <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>step.</b> [...] Force plates can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two. [...] Interestingly, this model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics.|$|E

2500|$|The word walk is {{descended from}} the Old English wealcan [...] "to roll". In humans and other bipeds, walking is {{generally}} distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground {{and there is a}} period of double-support. In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>step.</b> This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events. For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon {{the presence or absence of}} a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification. [...] The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at midstance. During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance, while during running, it is then at a minimum. This distinction, however, only holds true for locomotion over level or approximately level ground. For walking up grades above 9%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals. Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground (averaged across all feet) of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, although this definition is incomplete. Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.|$|E

60|$|This is {{also one}} of the answers to the {{following}} plea. 'Though the knowledge of every positive truth is an useful acquisition, this doctrine cannot without reservation he applied to negative truth. When the only truth ascertainable is that nothing can be known, we do not, by this knowledge, gain any new fact by which to guide ourselves.'[10] But logical coherency, but a kind of practical everyday coherency, which may be open to a thousand abstract objections, yet which still secures both to the individual and to society a number of advantages that might be endangered by any disturbance of opinion or motive. No doubt, and the method and season of chasing erroneous opinions and motives out of the mind must always be a matter of much careful and far-seeing consideration. Only in the course of such consideration, let us not admit the notion in any form that error can have even provisional utility. For it is not the error which confers the advantages that we desire to preserve, but some true opinion or just motive or high or honest sentiment, which exists and thrives and operates in spite of the error and in face of it, springing from man's spontaneous and unformulated recognition of the real relations of things. This recognition is very faint in the beginnings of society. It grows clearer and firmer <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>step</b> forward.

And dew--wears off! The little spot of faded colour, her tam-o'-shanter cap, wavered on far in front of him; she was looking up into every face, and at the house windows. Had any man ever such a cruel moment to go through? Whatever he did, he felt he would be a beast. And he uttered a groan which made a nursemaid turn and stare. He saw Megan stop and lean against the sea-wall, looking at the sea; and he too stopped. Quite likely she had never seen the sea before, and even in her distress could not resist that sight. 'Yes-she's seen nothing,' he thought; 'everything's before her. And just for a few weeks' passion, I shall be cutting her life to ribbons. I'd better go and hang myself rather than do it!' And suddenly he seemed to see Stella's calm eyes looking into his, the wave of fluffy hair on her forehead stirred by the wind. Ah! it would be madness, would mean giving up all that he respected, and his own self-respect. He turned and walked quickly back towards the station. But memory of that poor, bewildered little figure, those anxious eyes searching the passers-by, smote him too hard again, and once more he turned towards the sea.|$|E
