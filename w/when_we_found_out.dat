After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!'

60|$|Twice in my life, {{and twice}} lately, I {{have seen a}} piece of English pedantry bring us {{within an inch of}} an {{enormous}} English peril. The first was when all the Victorian historians and philosophers had told us that our German cousin was a cousin german and even germane; something naturally near and sympathetic. That also was an identification; that also was an assimilation; that also was a union of hearts. For the second time in a few short years, English politicians and journalists have discovered the dreadful revenge of reality. To pretend that something is what it is not is business that can easily be fashionable and sometimes popular. But the thing we have agreed to regard as what it is not will always abruptly punish and pulverise us, merely by being what it is. For years we were told that the Germans were a sort of Englishman because they were Teutons; but it was all the worse for us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> what Teutons really were. For years we were told that Jews were a sort of Englishman because they were British subjects. It is all the worse for us now we have to regard them, not subjectively as subjects, but objectively as objects; as objects of a fierce hatred among the Moslems and the Greeks. We are in the absurd position of introducing to these people a new friend whom they instantly recognise as an old enemy. It is an absurd position because it is a false position; but it is merely the penalty of falsehood.|$|E

As I said before I wasn't going to give you up, dead or alive, so yesterday when the sun went down a little in the afternoon I had two of our boats manned and pulled in shore, taking soundings to find a passage if there was one. I meant to go back and look for you with the brig or without the brig--but that doesn't matter now. There were three or four floating logs in sight. One of the Calashes in my boat made out something red on one of them. I thought it was worth while to go and see what it was. It was that man's sarong. It had got entangled among the branches and prevented him rolling off into the water. I was never so glad, I assure you, as <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that he was still breathing. If we could only nurse him back to life, I thought, he could perhaps tell me a lot of things. The log on which he hung had come out of the mouth of the creek and he couldn't have been more than half a day on it by my calculation. I had him taken down the main hatchway and put into a hammock in the 'tween-decks. He only just breathed then, but some time during the night he came to himself {{and got out of the}} hammock to lie down on a mat. I suppose he was more comfortable that way.

Television reviewer Alan Sepinwall was very positive towards the episode, praising it as a return to form for the series. [...] "Now that's more like it, Veronica Mars. A good self-contained mystery, a suggestion that the show could do okay once Veronica leaves high school, a gratuitously awesome [...] "Arrested Development" [...] double-cameo, the biggest spotlight yet for wisecracking Cliff, and a fine showcase for Jason Dohring, who's becoming so good that Veronica may need to investigate a case of show-stealing."

Pogoji reje so bili za vse živali enaki, razlikovali so se le v času začetka dajanja krme posamezni skupini. Skupina A je na 0 dan tehtala 41 g, skupina B 41, 73 g in skupina C 42, 09 g. Kontrolna skupina A je dobila takoj po izvalitvi vodo in krmo, testna skupina B je dobila vodo takoj, krmo 8 ur za skupino A in testna skupina C je dobila vodo takoj, krmo pa 16 ur za skupino A. Pri preverjanju teže živali smo ugotovili, da smo pri obeh testnih skupinah dosegli manjše telesne mase. Pri konverziji krme med kontrolno in prvo testno skupino nismo ugotovili posebnih razlik, večja razlika je bila pri drugi testni skupini. Na 35. dan tehtanja je kontrolna skupina A dosegla maso 2069 g, standardni odklon 225 in konverzijo krme 1, 57 kg. Prva testna skupina B je na 35. dan dosegla maso 2003 g, standardni odklon 198, 95 in konverzijo krme 1, 55 kg.

40|$|Even though today´s world unwinds on the {{increasing}} {{way of the}} globalisation, investors {{are aware of the}} possibilities the international markets offer and distance is not an issue any more, they are still governed by the “home bias factor“. This phenomenon implies that investors tend to prefer investing in domestic securities rather than entering the global market. Swedish investors are not the exception and the issue of the attraction of foreign fixed income securities is highlighted even more <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>out</b> there is lack of academic research about the topic from the perspective of Swedish investors. To narrow down the research subject and provide a reader with an interesting approach, we decided to examine the attraction of foreign government bonds from the perspective of Swedish investors. At the beginning of the paper we raised three research questions and defined the objective of the paper in questioning the existence of reasons to invest in foreign government bonds. Another research question was defined as identifying our local investor, who is entering the global market and last, but not least, what investing strategy do we recommend him to follow. Along the paper we proposed to apply a decent level of informative as well as a scientific approach to provide a reader with a valuable study concerning pre-defined topic. To reach more concrete outcomes of the study we have accepted couple of assumtions which we have identified ourselves with and we have stressed them especially during the theoretical part of the paper. After conducting the comprehensive analysis of the Swedish market for government bonds we have identified a huge gap between the demand and supply for such bonds and based on the discussion concerning the opportunities and risks connected with such investments we have defined our investor. Under given assumptions, as the most probable case of occurance we consider a rational investor, who is offsetting the balance of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities simultaneously looking for the best possible yield, the lowest possible risk and sound level of diversification. During the empirical analysis, namely examination of the national yield curves we set first, however very limited investment strategy. After the incorporation of the portfolio theory, currency rate risk and the existence of instruments covering the foreign currency exposure we have come into a conclusion that our investor does not have to necessarily prefer a security from the depicted efficient frontier, but he can employ other securities as well. As a consequence, when using 100 % hedging he can use whichever security on the global market. At the conclusion, stated findings imply another investigation, since our research was based on very strong assumptions presented during the study. Thus it by far does not provide the reader with a comprehensive investment analysis, which some readers might be interested in. However, even from the beginning we claimed {{that we do not have}} such an ambitious goal...|$|R

It would have been easy enough to get a divorce, and George would n't have opposed it; but I looked at it in this way: that the divorce wouldn't have put us back where we were, anyway, as I had supposed it would. We had broken into each other's lives, and we couldn't get out again, with all the divorces under the sun. That's the worst of getting married: you break into each other's lives. You said something like it to me, that day when you came back from your sail with Walter Libby. And I just concluded that there could n't be any trial that would n't be a great deal easier to bear than getting rid of all your trials; and I just made up my mind that if any divorce was to be got, George Maynard might get it himself; a temporary separation was bad enough for me, and I told him so, about the first words I could speak. And we're going to try the new departure on that platform. We don't either of us suspect we can have things perfectly smooth, but we've agreed to rough it together <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can't.

40|$|The Agawam River Project is a river study {{project for}} 8 th grade {{students}} at St. Margaret Regional School {{which is located}} in Buzzards Bay, in Southeastern Massachusetts. The mouth of the Agawam River where the river converges with the Wankinco River and the Wareham River in Wareham, is located approximately 5 km from the school. The headwaters of the river where the water overflows from Halfway Pond in Plymouth, is approximately 15 to 20 km away from the school. The river, ultimately as an estuary system, flows into the Buzzards Bay Watershed. Here, the fresh water of the three converging rivers mixes with the salt water of Buzzards Bay influenced by tides. Over the past 10 years, ten 8 th grade classes have collected samples and studied the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the Agawam River. The total number of participants is approximately 200 students. The data collected has been compiled into books depicting each year. This project has been showcased at the Barnstable County Fair, Americorps Environmental Exhibits, the Wareham Library, and St. Margaret Regional School. The chemical properties of river data collected have been sampled by sophisticated equipment, such as the HydroLab and Sigma, and by student collection using hands on Hach kits and turbidity tubes. Both methods have been valid systems of measurement when compared to one another over the years. The physical properties of river data collected have been collected by recording observations of the physical surroundings and by using nets and buckets to collect macroinvertebrates. The collection of macroinvertebrates is taken back to the classroom where density population is calculated. Often, the macroinvertebrates are released back into the river. Rare and healthy species are counted, but are not taken from the river. Over the past ten years, the chemical properties of our river study has proved the river to be a stable system. Nitrogen levels have been stable, turbidity is healthy, phosphorus levels are normal, and dissolved oxygen and temperature is consistent. One year, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> a high level of phosphorus, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> investigated <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that Wareham 2 ̆ 7 s Water Pollution Control Facility {{was in the process of}} upgrading the Facility to a Phosphorus and Nitrogen Removal Upgrade. The collection of macroinvertebrates often varies from year to year, depending on river flow, temperatures, anaerobic or aerobic soil, and influx of runoff. One year, we did find a higher amount of tolerant macroinvertebrates. We concluded that the surrounding soil was anaerobic, due to suffocation of the soil in an area of a tightly rooted river bank in orange colored soil, which most likely was iron. The physical surroundings of our study system has been changed over the past five years, due to a project by the DEP to barrier and control the flow of the water from the surrounding ponds into the river. We have observed that this has improved an area of extreme anaerobic soil to a faster flow which is helping the dissolved oxygen levels in this particular area. The students have researched the historical data of the river and have learned that Daniel Webster fished at this river and they have observed the ruins of a rolling mill. Agawam means 2 ̆ 2 a place where fish are caught 2 ̆ 2 from the Agawam tribes in the 1600 s. Fish ladders exist along the river for the herring to still find their way to Halfway Pond to spawn...|$|R
