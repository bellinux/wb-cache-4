25|$|A major {{turning point}} was {{the advent of}} {{civilian}} GPS in 1996. At first, GPS units were very costly and only offered basic functions, but that would soon change. Towards the late 1990s the Internet was awash in weather data and free weather software, the first true cellular Internet modems for consumer use also emerged providing chasers access to data in the field without having {{to rely on a}} nowcaster. The NWS also released the first free, up-to-date NEXRAD Level 3 radar data. In conjunction <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> GPS units now had the ability to connect with computers, granting greater ease when navigating.|$|E

25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century new {{innovations}} in the art of classical dance began to become apparent. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Petipa's rocky relationship with the new director of the Imperial Theatres, Vladimir Telyakovsky, appointed to the position in 1901, served as a catalyst to the Ballet Master's end. Telyakovsky made no effort in disguising his dislike of Petipa's work, as he felt that the art of classical ballet had become stagnant under him, and felt that other choreographers should have a chance {{at the helm of the}} Imperial Ballet. But even at the age of eighty-three, and suffering from the constant pain brought on by a severe case of the skin disease pemphigus, the old Maestro showed no signs of slowing down, much to Telyakovsky's chagrin.|$|E
500|$|In September 2017, PewDiePie {{used the}} racial slur [...] "nigger" [...] while live-streaming PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

PewDiePie later uploaded a short video apologizing for the language he used during the live-stream, expressing [...] "I'm not going to make any excuses to why it did because there are no excuses for it.

500|$|A natural goalscoring forward, Friday {{was also}} unselfish and would take {{just as much}} {{pleasure}} out of setting up a goal scored by a teammate as netting one himself. He possessed fine ball control and dribbling skills, and could also shoot with both great power and sharp accuracy. The strong physical aspect of his game and exceptionally competitive, combative spirit combined <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> to create a formidable forward player: such was his ability that his arrival transformed Reading {{into one of the}} division's best sides in a matter of weeks. Writing in 2010, Roger Titford stressed Friday's immediate and profound impact on the Reading team as a key factor in his lasting popularity: [...] "It was like the comic-book stories that kids from Robin's era would have read", he wrote. [...] "He was a ready-made star".|$|E
