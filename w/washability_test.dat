40|$|Glycol palmitoyl {{chitosan}} (GPC) is a hydrophobic {{derivative of}} chitosan described in literature {{as capable of}} self assembling in polymeric micelles. The palmitoyl derivatization involves the amino groups of the polysaccharide. These are the same groups generally considered responsible for the good mucoadhesive properties of chitosan, due to the ionic interaction with the sialic acidic moieties of the mucin. In the present work, the mucoadhesion properties of GPC micelles were evaluated by comparing the information obtained using different methods described in literature. This is a comparison which is not commonly found in literature. The results obtained by rheological synergism determination, turbidimetric analysis, zeta potential measurements, quantification of unadsorbed mucin and finally an ex vivo <b>washability</b> <b>test</b> were compared. Poloxamer micelles were also evaluated for comparison. The results obtained {{with all of the}} methods used were in good accordance to each other and indicated that even after self assembling in micelles, GPC maintains positive mucoadhesion properties...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Residual ridge {{resorption}} is an unpredictable, unavoidable and time-dependent process which occurs in denture-wearing patients {{especially those who}} use mandibular dentures. This process causes more problems in mandible because of its less support, tongue forces and more resorption. Inserting implants {{in many of these}} patients requires bone grafts. Overdentures are also more expensive. Denture adhesives are the last option to improve retention and masticatory function in denture-wearers with severe resorption of alveolar ridge. Nowadays only a few denture adhesives are used in Iran and there is not much information about their standard features including, pH, bond strength and washability. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine and compare the mentioned characteristics of four denture adhesives (Professional, Corega, Fittydent and Fixodent) and to introduce the most suitable denture adhesive for clinical use. Materials and Methods: All the methodologies of ISO 10873 : 2010 were applied. To measure the pH value, 1 ± 0. 1 g of each denture adhesive was diluted with 5 g of propylene glycol and mixed with water. Using pH meter, pH of each group was measured separately for 4 times (n= 4) and results were recorded. For the <b>washability</b> <b>test,</b> 4 dentures were fabricated (n= 4) and each group of denture adhesives was placed on a denture according to manufacture instructions. For simulating mouth environment specimens were placed in water at 37 ± 2 ̊C bath for 1 hour and then washed with a plastic brush. Specimens were examined for any residual adhesive and the results were recorded. For bond strength test, a sample holder was gently filled with denture adhesives and was attached to the holding arm of bond strength testing device (Santam, STM 20, Iran). Specimens were placed in 300 ml water bath at 37 ± 2 ̊C for 10 minutes, and then shaken to be dried and placed in the bond strength testing device. 10 N force with 5 mm/min rate was applied to the specimen. The force was maintained for 30 s and then device arm was pulled back and the highest number was recorded with computer software (Santam Machine Controller v 4. 19, Iran). The test performed 8 times (n= 8) for each adhesive and 8 results were recorded. Data were analyzed using ANOVA test for comparing the bond strength with a significant level fixed at 0. 05. Results: Professional and Corega adhesives had more neutral pH than that of Fittydent and Fixodent which were more acidic. <b>Washability</b> <b>test</b> showed no remaining mass of any adhesive and there was not any statistically significant difference between groups (P> 0. 05). Fittydent and Corega adhesives showed higher bond strength than that of Professional and Fixodent and this difference was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Professional and Corega adhesives had less acidity. Thus they cause less harmful effects on the oral mucosa than that of Fittydent and Fixodent and should be indicated in patients with little-tolerant oral mucousa such as diabetous, iron-deficiency anemia and hypertention. All the groups had acceptable washability. Fittydent and Corega had higher bond strength than that of Professional and Fixodent. Therefore in complete-denture-wearers who require more retention as a result of severe {{ridge resorption}}, macrotruma, and maladaptiivity, Fittydent and Corega seems to be more acceptable...|$|E
50|$|Although {{clothing}} {{has been}} used for protection against solar exposure for thousands of years, modern sun protective clothing was popularized (but not exclusively used) in Australia as an option or adjunct to sunscreen lotions and sunblock creams. Sun protective clothing and UV protective fabrics in Australia now follow a lab-testing procedure regulated by a federal agency: ARPANSA. This standard was established in 1996 after work by Australian swimwear companies. The British standard was established in 1998 by the National Radiological Protection Board and the British Standards Institute. Using the Australian method as a model, the USA standard was formally established in 2001, and now employs a more-stringent testing protocol that includes fabric longevity, abrasion/wear and <b>washability.</b> UPF <b>testing</b> is now widely used on clothing for outdoor activities.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of the present research work was to development and evaluate herbal vanishing cream. This vanishing cream Contain Green Tea Extract, Aloe Gel and Vitamin E: As Skin Toner. Herbal creams offer several advantages over other creams. The majority of existing creams which has prepared from drugs of synthetic origin and give extras fairness to face, but it has several side effects such as itching or several allergic reactions. Herbal creams {{do not have any}} of these side effects, without side effects it gives the nourishment to skin. Method carried out to prepare herbal cream was very simple. Firstly, oil phase was prepared, the mixture of stearic acid (17 %), potassium hydroxide (0. 5 %), sodium carbonate (0. 5 %) were melted at 700 C. Secondly aqueous phase was prepared, mixture of alcoholic extract of crude drugs, including Glycerin (6 %), perfume (0. 5 %), water (71 %) heated at 70 O c. Then aqueous phase was added into the oil phase at 70 O c with continuous stirring. Now, once the transfer was completed it was allowed to come at room temperature all the while being stirred. Perfume was added at last just before the finished product was transferred to suitable container. The above prepared herbal cream was evaluated. The physical parameters such as pH, homogeneity by visual and by touch, appearance (color), rubout (spread ability, wetness), <b>washability,</b> consistency, Patch <b>test,</b> irritancy test accelerated stability studies, type of smear, emolliency were determined.
