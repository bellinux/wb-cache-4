5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character.

5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to take Miletus.

This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E

The following cladogram simplified after an analysis presented by Julia B. Desojo, Martin D. Ezcurra and Edio E. Kischlat (2012).|$|E
