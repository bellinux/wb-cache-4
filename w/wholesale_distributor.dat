25|$|While {{the company}} traced its lineage to 1939, when Nathan Cummings {{acquired}} C. D. Kenny Company, a <b>wholesale</b> <b>distributor</b> of sugar, coffee, and tea in Baltimore, the Sara Lee Corporation {{was actually the}} descendant of a Chicago grocery store called Sprague, Warner & Company. This enterprise, which started on State Street in Chicago, was founded during the Civil War by Albert A. Sprague and Ezra J. Warner. By 1909, Sprague, Warner & Company {{was one of the}} leading wholesale grocery companies in the United States, famous for house brands such as Richelieu, Ferndell, and Batavia. In 1942, this company was acquired by the Canadian-born Cummings. The new Chicago-based company, at first called Sprague Warner–Kenny Corp., ranked as the largest grocery wholesaler in the United States. Annual sales grew from about $20 million in 1942 to $120 million by 1946. After changing its name in 1945 to Consolidated Grocers, Cummings's company became the Consolidated Foods Corporation in 1953.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the factory tried to enter new markets with the {{production}} of bromine, but closed production after a fire destroyed the production facility only two weeks after completion in 1985. Due to increasing competition {{in the market for}} fertilizers and the lack of new products, company revenue fell from 570 million DM in 1985 to 370 million DM. The company posted increasing financial losses, partly due to its locational disadvantage as all raw materials and all final goods had to be transported by truck from the factory to Cologne's Rhine harbor. Another disadvantage was the location of the factory in a densely populated residential area and a decreasing acceptance of the pollution caused by the factory. Without operating profits a relocation of the factory was not feasible, and thus, without any prospects, the fertilizer production was shut down in 1989. Employment fell from 1400 employees in 1985 to 830 in 1990, with the factory only producing sodium carbonate, calcium chloride and phosphate for animal feed. Although losses were reduced to almost zero in 1990, the financial situation deteriorated in 1992 when the prices for sodium carbonate fell. The fall in prices was partly due to the lifting of anti-dumping on sodium carbonate imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC) by the European Commission. Another factor in the worsening financial situation was an antitrust fine of US$1.38 million imposed by the European commission for participating in a sodium carbonate cartel together with Solvay and Imperial Chemical Industries. Company revenue fell to 225 million DM and losses increased to 9.6 million DM. On December 23, 1993 all remaining production was shut down and all remaining 700 workers were laid off. Since then Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH is the name of a <b>wholesale</b> <b>distributor</b> of chemicals and subsidiary of K+S AG (named Kali und Salz AG until 1999).

2500|$|A {{value added}} tax (VAT), {{also known as}} Goods and Services Tax (G.S.T), Single Business Tax, or Turnover Tax in some countries, applies the {{equivalent}} of a sales tax to every operation that creates value. To give an example, sheet steel is imported by a machine manufacturer. That manufacturer will pay the VAT on the purchase price, remitting that amount to the government. The manufacturer will then transform the steel into a machine, selling the machine for a higher price to a <b>wholesale</b> <b>distributor.</b> The manufacturer will collect the VAT on the higher price, but will remit to the government only the excess related to the [...] "value added" [...] (the price over the cost of the sheet steel). The <b>wholesale</b> <b>distributor</b> will then continue the process, charging the retail distributor the VAT on the entire price to the retailer, but remitting only the amount related to the distribution mark-up to the government. The last VAT amount is paid by the eventual retail customer who cannot recover any of the previously paid VAT. For a VAT and sales tax of identical rates, the total tax paid is the same, but it is paid at differing points in the process.|$|E
