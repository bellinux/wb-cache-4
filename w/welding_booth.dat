40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the emission sources of fine and ultrafine particles (UFPs) during brazing, welding, and grinding in a mechanical engineering factory and to characterize UFP exposure by measuring size distributions, number, and surface area concentrations. Methods: Samplings lasted 4 hours and were conducted during 5 days using the Grimm 1. 109 portable aerosol spectrometer, the Grimm portable NanoCheck™ 1. 320, the electrical low pressure impactor, and the nanoparticle aerosol monitor AeroTrak™ 9000. Results: Higher concentrations of fine particles {{were observed in}} welding and grinding activities. The highest values of UFP number and alveolar surface area concentrations were detected in the <b>welding</b> <b>booth.</b> Conclusions: Potential emission sources of fine particles and UFPs can be identified by the multifaceted approach outlined in this study. This sampling strategy provides important data on key UFP metrics...|$|E
40|$|The EP- 61 primary {{containment}} vessel of the 5320 shipping package {{has been used}} for storage and transportation of Pu- 238 plutonium oxide heat source material. For storage, the material in its convenience canister called EP- 60 is placed in the EP- 61 and sealed by two threaded caps with elastomer O-ring seals. When the package is shipped, the outer cap is seal welded to the body. While stored, the EP- 61 s are placed in a cooling water bath. In preparation for welding, several containers are removed from storage and staged to the <b>welding</b> <b>booth.</b> The significant heat generation of the contents, and resulting rapid rise in component temperature necessitates special handling practices. The test described here was performed to determine the temperature rise with time and peak temperature attained for an EP- 61 with 203 watts of internal heat generation, upon its removal from the cooling water bath...|$|E
2500|$|This {{redevelopment}} of TMTI {{involved a}} major replanning {{of the facilities}} on Amatuku motu including relocating the fire fighting simulator, the electricity power plant, residential block for the students and building a new double story school block. The workshop complex was renovated and now includes <b>welding</b> <b>booths.</b> [...] A new jetty was built, which incorporates the lifeboat launching davits. The work was completed in 2011.|$|R
40|$|This {{internship}} report includes validation {{documents required}} {{in meeting the}} quality criteria for secondary-level programs of instruction in agriculture. The documents are used during the review process conducted by subject matter experts from the California Department of Education. The internship included {{the development of the}} outdoor laboratory facility to accommodate horticultural instruction and student projects, and upgrading the agricultural mechanics facilities with new <b>welding</b> <b>booths</b> and equipment...|$|R

50|$|The MAC's 40000 sq ft of {{available}} space contains a working factory, classrooms, and administration offices and supplies secure space for startup companies wishing to access its facilities. The factory has a 5-ton and a 1-ton overhead crane, a loading dock, 220 and 480 volt 3-phase power, a paint room, and <b>welding</b> <b>booths.</b> The space is subdivided into classrooms, a conference room, a computer laboratory designed for CAD/CAM training, offices and training areas for manual, welding training, and CNC and EDM machine tool and precision grinding training. The facility also includes two classrooms seating 24 and 12 students, respectively, {{as well as}} five offices, a metrology lab, and a computer lab. There are five additional rooms available on the basement floor for offices, storage, a small production setup area, along with a test facility with a garage entrance and access to a 1-ton overhead crane.|$|R
