During summer {{vacation}} when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he was playing in Pawtucket. His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg {{asked him how he}} did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time you tell me how you did. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you how you did, it's how the team did." [...] Hoffman never forgot that. Given their age difference, Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates. [...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E

The song made its US radio premiere on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on August 26, 2013. It {{was released}} to all digital retailers on the same day. The song's accompanying music video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on September 23, 2013. The video also features Derulo's longtime girlfriend Jordin Sparks who appeares in the video due to Derulo writing the song about her. When speaking of the song Derulo said [...] "Marry Me {{is one of those}} very pulling heart strings kind of record, it’s very different than [...] "The Other Side" [...] … Basically it’s talking about getting ready for that moment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to marry me". The song has since peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and number 8 on the ARIA top 40 singles.|$|E
