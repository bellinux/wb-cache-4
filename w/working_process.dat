5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} {{such a thing}} would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion.

5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was inspired}} by Madonna's need to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that {{it was about the}} singer's personal views on life and spirituality. Like Truth or Dare, the performance scenes were shot in color, {{while the rest of the}} film was in black-and-white. Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, Åkerlund also shot her family, her <b>working</b> <b>process</b> and her day-to-day life. Madonna and her then-husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London was used for some sequences. The film features appearances from Madonna's father, stepmother and filmmaker Michael Moore.|$|E
25|$|Although the USA is most {{commonly}} known as the cradle of graffiti, American writers were also influenced by European tendencies. BG138 from Tats Crew confirmed in an interview that Europe was more advanced in some aspects, among those also being the 3D-style and a very cooperative <b>working</b> <b>process</b> – DAIM and Loomit shaped both. DAIM also realized works in Los Angeles and Miami among other cities in the USA. Crome, a writer from Miami commented on getting to know DAIM and Loomit and being impressed by how much planning was involved in their <b>working</b> <b>process.</b> In that way the graffiti could be finished at the location at a much faster pace. After the meeting Crome began to plan his works in advance, too. He also talked about his insights into proportions that he got from the Europeans. The writer Pest from Miami talks about DAIM and Loomit bringing the first Belton cans there, which changed the colour palette of the local writers. Freek used the (German) Belton cans only very economically and only as a crowning finale mixed with American colour, because he could never be sure when the next shipping was going to happen.|$|E

25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold <b>working</b> <b>process,</b> used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was the {{optimization}} of wire drawing process parameters. Design/methodology/approach: The hard binding material determined according to American standard ANSI/AWSA 5. 8 - 92 as High-temp 095 was chosen to the analysis of wire drawing process. It is hard solder with high fluidity properties. Findings: Wires, bars and strips are the most often use forms of this solder on the base of copper with low deformability properties, which shows crack sensitivity during cold plastic <b>working</b> <b>processes</b> so there was the necessity to determining optimal parameters of initial material use to the later cold plastic <b>working</b> <b>processes.</b> Research limitations/implications: To the numerical analysis of Hi-temp 095 wire drawing process the Drawing 2 d programme based of finite element method, has been use, for initial materials obtained on the casting and extrusion way.

2500|$|Wire {{drawing is}} a {{metalworking}} process {{used to reduce}} the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). [...] There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. [...] Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold <b>working</b> <b>process,</b> {{but it may be}} performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.|$|E
2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold <b>working</b> <b>process,</b> however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|E

2500|$|Ann Kipling (born 1934 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) is a Canadian {{artist who}} creates impressionistic portraits and landscapes on paper from direct observation. [...] Kipling's {{distinctive}} style of overlapping, temporally suggestive linework is formed through her <b>working</b> <b>process,</b> which involves drawing her subject over time, recording subtle shifts in {{movement in the}} sitter or landscape during that period.

While not directly connected to any art movement in particular, connections can be made to Chinese landscape painters and the watercolours of Paul Cézanne. Using colour minimally, her primary media is etching, drawing, watercolours, pen, pencil, pastels and pencil crayons. She lives and works in Falkland, BC, a location which serves as a focus for her recent landscapes.|$|E

The young Kappus wrote to Rilke, who had also attended the academy, between 1902 and 1908 when he was uncertain about his future career as a military officer or as a poet. [...] Initially, he sought Rilke's advice as to the quality of his poetry, and whether he ought to pursue writing as a career. [...] While he declined to comment on Kappus's writings, Rilke advised Kappus on how a poet should feel, love, and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art. [...] These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his <b>working</b> <b>process.</b> [...] Further, these letters were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of Das Stunden-Buch (The Book of Hours) and Das Buch der Bilder (The Book of Images).|$|E
