25|$|With one exception, {{the race}} has been run {{at a level}} weight of 126 pounds (with a 5-pound {{allowance}} for fillies) since 1900. The 126 pounds comes from the English Classics, where the standard weight is 9 stone, with one stone equaling 14 pounds. In 1913, the Belmont was run as a handicap with the winner carrying only 109 pounds compared to the runner-up carrying 126 pounds.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{kinematic}} and spatioternporal gait variables of aquatic walking with additional weight applied on the affected limb in people post-stroke. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals post-stroke with hemiparesis (age 66 ??? 11 yrs, 5 females: 16 males) {{participated in this}} study. A repeated measures comparative design {{was used to compare}} the aquatic gait patterns among three different walking conditions for aquatic walking. Participants walked in water at chest depth (xiphoid process) under each walking condition. Kinematic and spatiotemporal gait variables were processed and analyzed by using Vicon Motus Video v 9. 2. RESULTS: The use of additional weight, regardless of position showed increase in gait speed and foot-off percentage of the less-affected limb compared to no <b>weight</b> <b>condition</b> (all Ps < 0. 05). Knee <b>weight</b> <b>condition</b> showed a significant decrease in sagittal plane knee range of motion of the less-affected limb compared to no <b>weight</b> <b>condition</b> (P < 0. 05). Ankle <b>weight</b> <b>condition</b> showed significant decrease in peak knee flexion and sagittal plane ankle range of motion of the less-affected limb compared to no <b>weight</b> <b>condition</b> (both Ps < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The use of additional weight could provide stability during gait training in people post-stroke. The study findings suggest that the use of additional weight on the affected limb for people post-stroke may reduce compensatory movement patterns and demonstrate a similar walking pattern to that seen on land. Depending on the level of function, the use of additional weight could provide benefits to restore healthy gait patterns in people post-stroke...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at two sturgeon farms to test the hypotheses that husbandry and diets with different protein and lipid content affect the body <b>weight,</b> <b>condition</b> factor, caviar yield, egg texture and stage of development (egg size and germinal vesicle migration) at harvest and that vernalization affects the fish <b>weight,</b> <b>condition</b> factor, the concentrations of plasma sex steroids (testosterone, T and estradiol- 17 ß, E 2), and the incidence of the ovarian follicular atresia. Ninety-two individually marked females, originated from the same brood fish were fed two different diets for 6 months on each farm, followed by a 5 month vernalization at a communal coldwater facility, where the dietary treatments continued. Fish were sampled, before and after vernalization, for length, weight, plasma T and E 2, and for caviar yield, egg diameter, polarization index (PI), and egg texture at the roe harvest. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not reveal significant effects of farm, diet and their interaction on body <b>weight,</b> <b>condition</b> factor, caviar yield, egg texture and stage of development at harvest (P > 0. 05). A mixed model with repeated measure revealed a significant decrease of fish <b>weight,</b> <b>condition</b> factor, and plasma T concentration during vernalization (P < 0. 0001), {{as well as an}} effect of farm on plasma T concentration (P < 0. 0001) and an interactive effect of farm ? sampling time (P = 0. 0086) on plasma E 2 concentration. Fishes maintained normal ovarian follicles and the plasma E 2 concentrations during vernalization period.
