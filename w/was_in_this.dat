5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 {{runs in the}} Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E

When the 6th Earl's son died without issue in 1329, he {{obtained}} licence from the king to entail his estates on his nephew, John.

The case displayed actual physical light bulbs made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|From 1793, seven small {{houses at}} {{the east side of}} the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000florins.|$|E

5|$|From 1927 to 1928, Agârbiceanu, a {{recipient}} of the National Prize for Literature, headed the Cluj chapter of Astra and edited Transilvania. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> magazine that he wrote a number of articles in support of eugenics, calling on priests to promote the movement in their parishes. Given the secular values of the movement's leaders in Romania, his participation was somewhat incongruous, but Agârbiceanu did not see a conflict between his religious creed and a current centered around supposedly objective natural laws. From 1930, he participated in Astra's literary section and headed its cultural congress, in which capacity he lectured on the organization's role in Romanian cultural life. Additionally, he played a prominent role during its annual congresses and committed himself to social activism. He was involved in Astra's literacy campaigns, inspecting and fundraising for village libraries {{in places such as}} Aleșd.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995.

Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster {{bought the}} castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its {{associated}} manor descended through the Webster family. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy. Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures.|$|E

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{context that}} Abu Taghlib is first {{mentioned}} in 964, {{when his father}} had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{manner that}} Fortune and Loveday {{claimed that they}} {{received}} a text, The Cosmic Doctrine, which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925. These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe, and were {{very similar to the}} ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his Aphorism of Creation and Cosmic Principles. The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in Theosophy. In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of The Cosmic Doctrine in 1949.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> palace that Alboin {{was killed}} on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most {{detailed}} narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by Marius of Aventicum in his Chronica, written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king {{was killed in a}} conspiracy by a man close to him, called Hilmegis (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. Roger Collins describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.|$|E

5|$|Johnston's best match {{performance}} came in {{the only}} loss in the Third Test at Adelaide. This happened when captain Lindsay Hassett was a late withdrawal due to injury, leaving Australia with an unbalanced team with only four specialist batsmen who could not consolidate the work done by the five specialist bowlers. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> match that Johnston passed 100 Test wickets, the fastest player to do so. Exploiting a wet patch at the striker's end, Johnston took 6/62 in the first innings as 22 wickets fell {{on the first day}} in treacherous batting conditions; however he was unable to stop an Australian defeat, taking only 1/50 in the second innings as the tourists reached their target of 233 with six wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime is a 2001 American {{documentary}} film in which actors William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy discuss the Star Trek science fiction franchise {{and its effects}} on their lives. Shatner and Nimoy portrayed the characters James T. Kirk and Spock respectively in the , the , and their film sequels. They talk about differences they had with Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, and about the strained relationships between Shatner {{and some of the other}} cast members. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> film that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with alcoholism while he was acting in the original television series. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after suffering from alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1864, {{the group}} {{set out from}} Fairmount Springs. Initially they sought a deserter named Silas Karns, but {{they were unable to}} find him. They next sought for a deserter named Wolf instead, {{supposedly}} hiding in the home of a man named Joseph Hess, and then for a deserter named Gomer Smith in Sugarloaf Township, but neither could be located. Finally they attempted to find a man named Thomas Smith, living in Benton Township near Raven Creek. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area that four more people joined the Lincoln Midnight Riders. Thomas Smith escaped into a cornfield while his wife alerted the neighborhood about the arrival of the group. A party of locals arrived, including at least three armed deserters.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the rebellious}} forces held out, however, and their stronghold was the {{virtually}} impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In {{the summer of}} 1266, a siege of the castle was initiated, but the effort proved futile. There were rumours that Montfort's son Simon was planning an invasion of England from Normandy, {{and this was the}} hope that the rebels hung on to. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> situation that the papal legate Ottobuono Fieschi exerted his influence, to make the king pursue a more conciliatory policy. In August, the king summoned a parliament at Kenilworth, where the siege was ongoing. He commissioned a number of earls, barons and bishops to draft a treaty of reconciliation.|$|E
