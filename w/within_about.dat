Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, citrus fruits, benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, mouth ulcers usually develop <b>within</b> <b>about</b> 12–24 hours of exposure.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the {{predominant}} echinoderms, and some limestones {{from this period}} are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events {{that occurred during the}} late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly <b>within</b> <b>about</b> sixty million years during the Early Jurassic {{and the beginning of the}} Middle Jurassic. A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is <b>within</b> <b>about</b> 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs only <b>within</b> <b>about</b> 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, {{where it}} typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E
5|$|Of all the {{measured}} parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity {{is the most}} uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity is inconsistent {{with the presence of}} the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out <b>within</b> <b>about</b> ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} 1798 and the {{beginning}} of 1799 marked {{the beginning}} of the War of the Second Coalition. <b>Within</b> <b>about</b> a year of its formation, the Legion had become about 10,000. However, the new series of struggles proved to be much more difficult, as the anti-French coalition advanced upon Italy, now bereft of elite French units which were with Napoleon in Egypt. Overall, 1799 saw the Legions take significant casualties. In mid-1799, the First Legion under General Dąbrowski fought against the Russians at Trebbia (17–19 June 1799), where it suffered heavy casualties (only two of the five battalions survived the battle, and Dąbrowski was wounded). Polish legionaries also fought at the Battle of Novi (15 July 1799), and the Second Battle of Zurich (26 September).|$|E

Extensions to the highway designation moved the termini in the 1930s and 1940s east to M-29 (Jefferson Avenue) and US16 (Grand River Avenue, now M-5). A change in the 1960s added a section of north–south roadway to {{the eastern end of}} M-102; that change was reversed <b>within</b> <b>about</b> a year.

5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun).

Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun.

5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion <b>within</b> <b>about</b> a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged the coral reef system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at the reefs was banned for several weeks. The waves had damaged the coral reef system to such extent that there was no regrowth after seven years.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker <b>within</b> <b>about</b> four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
