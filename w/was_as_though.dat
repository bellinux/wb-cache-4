5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E

This sensation, she said, <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> something heavy was moving from {{the top of her head}} down through her body before leaving her. Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a benign tumor. She reported that she still felt some pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E

500|$|The game's repetitiveness was criticised by many reviewers. Sam Zucchi of Kill Screen {{said that}} the game got tedious and that the repetitiveness of {{clicking}} on objects was sometimes trivial. He said that it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the game was saying: [...] "No, you really don't understand. Let me show you". Alessandro Baravalle of Eurogamer said that although parts of the game were poorly managed or redundant, it did have some exciting moments. Eric Swain {{said that the}} story is great but the game {{as a whole is}} let down by the repetitiveness of some parts and, as a result, becomes exhausting to play.|$|E

500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Cruttwell enlisted in the Royal Berkshire Regiment and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He fought in France and Belgium, until a severe leg wound in 1916 ended his front line military service. Apart from its physical effects, Cruttwell's experience in the trenches seemingly inflicted permanent psychological damage on his personality, replacing the general good manners of his youth with a short-tempered, impatient and bullying character. The novelist Evelyn Waugh, an undergraduate at Hertford in the 1920s, wrote later that [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he had never cleansed himself from the muck of the trenches". [...] In {{the latter part of the}} war, Cruttwell was employed in the military intelligence department at the War Office in London, before returning to Oxford in 1919. In 1922, he published a short history of his regiment's wartime exploits.|$|E
500|$|Aaron Rutkoff of Wall Street Journal touted the installment; [...] "The writers' oratorical impulses {{were mostly}} kept in check, giving us instead an action-filled A plot {{in the field}} and a suspenseful B plot on the farm, and both have serious stakes. The motif {{connecting}} the two plots: knives. This episode was all about knives." [...] Gary Roszko of The Huffington Post stated that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was a nice transition from what he thought was the typical development of the show. Sepinwall asserted that the episode was the strongest telecast since the second-season premiere, [...] "What Lies Ahead". While CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell felt {{that it was a good}} telecast, he declared that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor. New York Starlee Kine was critical of the flashbacks in the episode, who described the process as baffling. She wrote, [...] "It was done in the oddest way, though, where the flashbacks didn’t add any additional information than that which we already knew. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the writers thought a flashback could be used in place of their characters having backstories, instead of as a vehicle to convey them." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry Brougham {{wrote of}} the public {{reaction}} to Charlotte's death, [...] "It really <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child." [...] The whole kingdom went into deep mourning; linen-drapers ran out of black cloth. [...] Even the poor and homeless tied armbands of black on their clothes. [...] The shops closed for two weeks, as did the Royal Exchange, the Law Courts, and the docks. [...] Even gambling dens shut down {{on the day of}} her funeral, as a mark of respect. [...] Wrote The Times, [...] "It certainly does not belong to us to repine at the visitations of Providence... there is nothing impious in grieving for that as a calamity." [...] Mourning was so complete that the makers of ribbons and other fancy goods (which could not be worn during the period of mourning) petitioned the government to shorten the period, fearing they would otherwise go bankrupt. [...] A dissenting note was struck by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who in his An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte, indicated that the execution of three men the day after the Princess's death for plotting to overthrow the government was a greater tragedy.|$|E

500|$|Two days later, on 26 August, the Beatles {{travelled}} {{by train}} {{to the college}} campus in Bangor, Wales. It was perhaps {{the first time the}} band had travelled without their tour managers and they had not even thought to bring money. The station was mobbed because of a bank holiday and Cynthia Lennon, mistaken for a fan, was held back. She ran after the train but missed it and arrived later by car. The group, along with Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Cilla Black, Harrison's sister-in-law Jenny Boyd, and around 300 others, learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation, and were given their mantras. The group [...] "hesitated only slightly" [...] when asked to donate the customary week's wages, a large sum for a Beatle, to learn. While there, they announced at a press conference that they were giving up drugs (apparently referring to psychedelics, but not marijuana). This was a choice [...] "in keeping with the Maharishi's teachings" [...] but one made prior to meeting the Maharishi. The Maharishi did advise them privately to avoid involvement with the [...] "Ban the Bomb" [...] movement and to support the elected government of the day. Their intention was to attend the entire ten-day seminar but their stay was cut short by the death of their manager, Epstein, in London on 27 August. The Maharishi consoled them by saying that Epstein's spirit was still with them and their good thoughts would help him [...] "to have an easy passage" [...] and journey to his [...] "next evolution". According to McCartney, the Maharishi [...] "was great to us when Brian died" [...] and Cynthia Lennon wrote [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though,</b> with Brian gone, the four needed someone new to give them direction and the Maharishi was {{in the right place at}} the right time." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
500|$|... "The Grinning Man" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% {{share of the}} total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: [...] "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." [...] Of the episode itself, he wrote: [...] "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy {{in a way that}} defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story." [...] The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: [...] "it really is difficult {{to tell the difference between}} the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." [...] While The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing [...] "a slightly grumpier version" [...] of himself, he was [...] "quite impressed" [...] by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that [...] "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was [...] "solid" [...] and its solution was [...] "satisfyingly creepy", but that [...] "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." [...] Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot [...] "nonsense" [...] which [...] "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that [...] "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done." [...] The Observers Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode: ...|$|E

I was still there in the trenches with a few men; we knew the armistice had been signed, but we had been forgotten; so had a section of the Germans opposite.

Although it {{was approved}} twice by the censorship board in March, new Minister of Information Yvon Bourges overrode the approvals in April and banned the film. In response, Beauregard began a public campaign in its defense; many journalists, including Godard and Chabrol, wrote editorials demanding the film's release. A [...] "Manifesto of the 1,789" [...] in support {{was signed by}} Jacques Prévert, Raymond Queneau, Marguerite Duras and several major French book publishers, and many Catholic priests and nuns denounced the ban's effect on freedom of speech. Rivette told Le Figaro litteraire, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they had guillotined us", and in Rouen his father André vehemently defended the film against the city's efforts to ban it.|$|E

[...] Coretta had been home all day with their children, since the birth of their daughter Bernice had not allowed her to attend Easter Sunday church services. Since Mrs. King had issued her own statement regarding the aid of the president instead of doing as her husband had told her and report to Wyatt Walker, this according to author Taylor Branch, made her portrayed by reports as [...] "an anxious new mother who may have confused her White House fantasies with reality." ...|$|E
