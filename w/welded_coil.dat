2500|$|Before the 1950s, the {{traditional}} European wine {{was made in}} small containers where the temperature did not rise high enough {{to interfere with the}} fermentation but this method of vinification gave wine structure and roundness but was not aromatic. In California and Australia the need to cool the grapes and wine during fermentation led winemakers to equip their cellars with adequate equipment: refrigeration units, circuits of pipes to carry the liquid refrigerant, and vats temperature-regulated by coils in the walls of the vessel or flag (a thin <b>welded</b> <b>coil</b> shaped like a flat plate with a high heat exchange capability). This mode of production happened in Europe {{at the same time as}} new techniques of treatment of the must (accelerated settling, use of selected yeasts, addition of glues and yeast enzymes, the practice of maceration). In wine jargon, all of these practices give a [...] "technological wine". This is very fragrant, crisp on the palate, and does not require ageing. The [...] "old" [...] type of European white wines were well suited to this type of wine – it was the Sauvignon B grape varietal that was first used in this manner which allowed it to be blended with Semillon B. There has also been a decrease in growing areas in the last thirty years. In Burgundy these practices may face the phenomenon of premature oxidation. Chardonnay is the archetype of the great wine that can be produced with old-fashioned methods.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{pulse welding}} process, one of high speed welding processes, uses {{electromagnetic}} force from discharged current through a working coil which develops a repulsive force between the induced currents flowing parallel {{and in the}} opposite direction in the work piece to be <b>welded.</b> <b>Coils</b> of specific geometry and material combinations are essentially required to achieve precise and successful electromagnetic (EM) welding. The aim of the present research is to assess the weldability criteria of high speed magnetic pulse welding for tubular jobs of Al, Cu and SS combinations using finite element analysis. A circular design of EMW coil is proposed to perform EMW simulations while varying the air gap between the outer tube and inner tube of different work pieces and voltages. A 3 -dimensional electromagnetic FE-model has been developed to analyze the distribution of electromagnetic force and magnetic flux density. Results of electromagnetic forces and magnetic flux density acquired during EMW simulations of various material combinations are shown here. The data shown in the results provides a guideline to choose EM welding parameters for further experimentations. The demonstrated results will assist future researchers to develop a better methodology for coil design and to further explore the field...|$|R

50|$|Induction welding {{is a form}} of {{resistance}} welding. In induction welding however there are no points of contact between the metal being welding and the electrical source or the welder. In induction <b>welding</b> a <b>coil</b> is wrapped around a cylinder. This coil causes a magnetic field {{across the surface of the}} metal inside. This magnetic field flows in the opposite direction of the magnetic field on the inside of the cylinder. These magnetic flows impede each other. This heats up the metal and causes either the damaged or separate edges to melt together.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} nature-inspired optimisation algorithms, in particular, the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) Algorithm and the Bees Algorithm. The PSO Algorithm is a population-based stochastic optimisation technique first invented in 1995. It {{was inspired by the}} social behaviour of birds flocking or a school of fish. The Bees Algorithm is a population-based search algorithm initially proposed in 2005. It mimics the food foraging behaviour of swarms of honey bees. The thesis presents three algorithms. The first algorithm called the PSO-Bees Algorithm is a cross between the PSO Algorithm and the Bees Algorithm. The PSO-Bees Algorithm enhanced the PSO Algorithm with techniques derived from the Bees Algorithm. The second algorithm called the improved Bees Algorithm is a version of the Bees Algorithm that incorporates techniques derived from the PSO Algorithm. The third algorithm called the SNTO-Bees Algorithm enhanced the Bees Algorithm using techniques derived from the Sequential Number-Theoretic Optimisation (SNTO) Algorithm. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithms, they were applied to different optimisation problems. The PSO-Bees Algorithm is used to train neural networks for two problems, Control Chart Pattern Recognition and Wood Defect Classification. The results obtained and those from tests on well known benchmark functions provide an indication of the performance of the algorithm relative to that of other swarm-based stochastic optimisation algorithms. The improved Bees Algorithm was applied to mechanical design optimisation problems (design of <b>welded</b> beams and <b>coil</b> springs) and the mathematical benchmark problems used previously to test the PSO-Bees Algorithm. The algorithm incorporates cooperation and communication between different neighbourhoods. The results obtained show that the proposed cooperation and communication strategies adopted enhanced the performance and convergence of the algorithm. The SNTO-Bees Algorithm was applied to a set of mechanical design optimisation problems (design of <b>welded</b> beams, <b>coil</b> springs and pressure vessel) and mathematical benchmark functions used previously to test the PSO-Bees Algorithm and the improved Bees Algorithm. In addition, the algorithm was tested with a number of deceptive multi modal benchmark functions. The results obtained help to validate the SNTO-Bees Algorithm as an effective global optimiser capable of handling problems that are deceptive in nature with high dimensions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Quasi-Poloidal Stellarator (QPS) {{is being}} {{developed}} to test key physics issues at very low plasma aspect ratio, 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 that of existing stellarators. Engineering innovation is driven by both the complex 3 -D design requirements {{and the need for}} reduced cost and risk in fabrication. Complex, highly accurate stainless steel modular coil winding forms are cast and machined; conductor is wound directly onto the modular coil winding forms; a vacuum-tight cover is <b>welded</b> over each <b>coil</b> pack; the coils are vacuum pressure impregnated; and the completed coils are installed in an external vacuum vessel. As a result, QPS differs significantly in design and construction from other toroidal devices. Figure 1 shows a cutaway view of the QPS device...|$|R
40|$|These {{internal}} coils {{are used}} to condense and cool the gaseous argon contained in the LAr storage dewar at D 0, at a rate not to exceed 40 KW. The coolant is LN{sub 2 }, piped in from another, similar, dewar of 36 -feet higher elevation (see Diagram A). The specific design of the coils are outlined in Process Engineering drawing C- 32545, attached. The material components are as follows. The internal coil piping material is constructed of 165 -feet of 1 1 / 2 -inch NPS schedule 40 pipe, of type 5083 aluminum. 3 -inch NPS schedule 80 type 5086 aluminum pipe {{is used for the}} headers of the triple hairpin <b>coil</b> <b>welded</b> assembly. The <b>coils</b> are supported by a series of aluminum brackets fixed to the roof of the dewar. Note 35 on the drawing points out the brackets which hold the coils to the roof of the dewar. They are not connected in any way to the coils, and act only as supports. This feature allows for contraction of the coils, and avoids any longitudinal thermal contraction stresses at the vessel nozzles that might have occurred. A stress analysis of the internal coil feed lines is outlined in DO engineering note 239. The analysis shows that the stresses experienced by the nodes where the coil feed lines pierce the inner vessel are on the order of one fifth of the stresses allowable for this design. The coils have been pressure tested at Process Engineering at 200 psi, which is above the accepted percentage for pressure tests of vessels of 125 % of maximum allowable working pressure. The maximum pressure which could theoretically develop in the condenser coil is 150 psi. Anything above this pressure will vent through PSV 614 N, set at 150 psi. In addition, the coils have been satisfactorily leak checked at PEI and at Fermilab...|$|R
50|$|Large-diameter pipe (25 cm or greater) may be ERW, EFW or Submerged Arc Welded ("SAW") pipe. There are two {{technologies}} {{that can be}} used to manufacture steel pipes of sizes larger than the steel pipes that can be produced by seamless and ERW processes. The two types of pipes produced through these technologies are longitudinal-submerged arc-welded (LSAW) and spiral-submerged arc-welded (SSAW) pipes. LSAW are made by bending and welding wide steel plates and most commonly used in oil and gas industry applications. Due to their high cost, LSAW pipes are seldom used in lower value non-energy applications such as water pipelines. SSAW pipes are produced by spiral (helicoidal) <b>welding</b> of steel <b>coil</b> and have a cost advantage over LSAW pipes, as the process uses coils rather than steel plates. As such, in applications where spiral-weld is acceptable, SSAW pipes may be preferred over LSAW pipes. Both LSAW pipes and SSAW pipes compete against ERW pipes and seamless pipes in the diameter ranges of 16”-24”.|$|R
40|$|Eddy current {{testing is}} one of the most widely Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods which {{utilized}} in the industry especially in oil and gas, aircraft, nuclear and coating industries. Experimental studies of eddy current testing have emerged as an important approach alongside numerical. This paper is to design, fabricate and investigate the maximum eddy current testing that can detect subsurface defect in the carbon steel S 45 C block. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The material of the artificial defect block is carbon steel (S 45 C) with dimension of 180 mm (length) × 25 mm (width) × 60 mm (height). There are eight artificial defects which located 20 mm parallel to the length of the block with 0. 5 mm diameter. The distance defect is located in between 0. 5 mm to 4. 00 mm from the surface of the artificial defect block. Weld probe with diameter size of 16 mm and 9 mm are used to perform the inspection. Findings: Experiments showed that the weld probe with diameter 16 mm able to detect subsurface defect up to 4. 0 mm and 2. 0 mm for 9 mm diameter weld probe. The optimum of eddy current testing frequency for carbon steel S 45 C is depending on the defect distance from the material surface. Applications/Improvements: The results prove that the maximum depth of the subsurface can be measured by using eddy current testing method, which is depending on the frequency of the exciting <b>coil</b> <b>weld</b> probe...|$|R
