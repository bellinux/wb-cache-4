5|$|In {{addition}} to industrial growth, the 1880s and 1890s were {{a period of}} significant growth in downtown commercial building. The retail district <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> at Fourth Street and Washington Avenue, while banking and business <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> to the south, at Fourth and Olive streets. During the 1890s, significant retailers and businesses moved westward; among the new buildings constructed {{as a result of}} this movement was the Wainwright Building. Designed by Louis Sullivan in 1891, the Wainwright was the tallest building in the city at the time of its construction and remains an example of early skyscraper design.|$|E

5|$|Convection {{continued}} but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly {{wind shear}} which stinted {{the strengthening of}} this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel with {{the west coast of}} Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85miles (137km) south of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Minoan eruption, {{the walls of the}} caldera formed a nearly {{continuous}} ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and the tiny island of Aspronisi.

When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff. Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.|$|E

As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat from Detroit.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 2007, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. It encountered conditions favorable for gradual development, and on August12 it gained organization and became a low. Strong upper-level easterly winds slowed development, but on August13 the tropical wave gained enough organization that the National Hurricane Center designated it Tropical Depression Four. At this time it <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> about 520mi (835km) west-southwest of Cape Verde.|$|E

5|$|The old Sixth District <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> {{in southwestern}} and south-central Ohio around McEwen's hometown, Hillsboro. After redistricting, McEwen found himself {{running in a}} huge area {{stretching}} from Lebanon to Marietta. This new district {{was very difficult to}} campaign in. It spilled across six media markets, meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in cities where most of the viewers couldn't vote in the district. It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements. His Democratic opponent was psychologist Ted Strickland, whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> 290miles (490km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained broad and ill-defined. However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Depression Six while it <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> about 1,150miles (1,850km) {{east of the}} southernmost Lesser Antilles on September3. Later that day, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Erika. It moved west-northwestward and steadily intensified to attain hurricane status on September4. Erika passed a short distance {{to the north of}} the Lesser Antilles, and later turned to the north in response to an approaching trough. The hurricane quickly strengthen to reach peak winds of 125mph (195km/h) on September8, and after maintaining peak strength for 24hours Erika weakened over cooler waters. It turned to the east, weakened to a tropical storm, and became extratropical after passing near the Azores on September15.|$|E

5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had become too constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt).

5|$|Following Mexico's {{independence}} from Spain, {{the new nation}} established long-term settlements, including Anahuac and San Jacinto, around the bay.

Following Texas' {{independence from}} Mexico and its annexation by the United States, economic growth <b>was</b> <b>centered</b> initially on agriculture and cattle ranching. Commerce grew between Galveston, Harrisburg and Houston in the later 19th century, and created additional economic opportunities as railroads were built through the Bay Area to connect these and other commercial centers.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, Belgium possessed two {{colonies in}} Africa—the Belgian Congo, {{which it had}} {{controlled}} since its annexation of the Congo Free State in 1908, and Ruanda-Urundi, a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations. The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, {{making it one of}} the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time. The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The Great Depression led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.
