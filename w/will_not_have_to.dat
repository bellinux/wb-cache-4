Jaime orders the High Sparrow to release Margaery and her brother Loras, threatening force against the Faith Militant.

The client represents the governmental paper {{interests of the}} branch's entire surrounding county, and it is mentioned that taking him on could mean Dunder-Mifflin <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> close one of its branches â€“ a threat that had been looming for the past year. Jan is initially disgusted with Michael's antics (which began with Michael changing the meeting location from a hotel meeting room to Chili's without permission) and refusal to talk business, but discovers {{at the end of}} the day that there is a method to his madness when the client bonds with Michael, allowing him to close the deal. Afterwards, in the parking lot, Michael and the recently divorced Jan kiss and leave together.|$|E
5|$|Warring Capulets (Michael Toland) and Montagues (Stephen Goldberg), {{portrayed as}} Steller and California sea lions respectively, have their feud watched sadly by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet (Patricia Trippett). A {{fight on the}} shore is ended when the Prince (Phil Nibbelink), a large and monstrous {{elephant}} seal, appears and warns the two groups that, should there be any more disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island, a fin shaped rock where a shark lives. Romeo (Daniel Tripett), Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing {{to fall in love}} with someone. His humorous friend, Mercutio (Chip Albers), urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio (Sam Gold), to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in white sand to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight. Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, who attends the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> marry the Prince.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{using this}} principle, {{it is still}} {{expected}} {{that a large number}} of factories and datasets will be defined and it can be difficult to keep track of which ones are available. This can be supported by good documentation of the software. To facilitate this, we automated the process of documentation, so that as the model is growing, so is the documentation. Documentation is not only useful for the programmer who would like to add a new plugin for example, but also for the user who <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> access <b>to</b> the code, and who <b>will</b> <b>not</b> want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through it. We have used annotations on asset and behaviour factories and on the methods within the classes that are used for input parameters. These annotations are discovered automatically by the documentation generator, and used to generate consistent documentation for the parameters and required data providers of each factory.|$|R
