5|$|Conditions {{improved}} slightly {{after the}} death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him {{as the head of the}} mathematics department.|$|E

5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E
5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she <b>was</b> <b>fed.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{internal}} politics {{he attempted}} to strengthen {{the power of the}} monarchy, but this was mostly thwarted by the szlachta, who valued their independence and democratic powers. Władysław suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the Polish Sejm (parliament) to check the King's power and limit his dynastic ambitions. Władysław <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> up with the weak position of the king in the Commonwealth; his politics included attempting to secure a small, preferably hereditary territory – like a duchy – where his position would be much stronger.|$|E
5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E
5|$|Strategic {{deception}} included increasing {{military activity}} far away, near Moscow. At {{the sites of}} the planned attack, elaborate disinformation <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> to the enemy. Defence lines were built to deceive German tactical reconnaissance. Civilians within 25 kilometres of the front were evacuated, and trenches were dug around the villages for Luftwaffe reconnaissance to see. Conversely, along the uninvolved Voronezh Front, bridging equipment and boats were prepared to suggest an offensive there. The five real bridges that were built for the attack were masked by the construction of seventeen false bridges over the River Don.|$|E

5|$|Telephone {{services}} reached Whitemore in 1918, initially {{with only}} three subscribers. Telephone switching was done at the post office. Whitemore {{was connected to the}} State's electricity system in 1929. The electricity <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> from the Hydro-Electric scheme and was connected to twelve buildings, in Whitemore and several nearby farms, by August of the same year. There may have been blacksmiths in Whitemore from the mid-19th century. A blacksmith established a shop on the main road in 1895 that was, by 1900, the only blacksmith in the area. Shaw Contracting's office is on the site of this former blacksmith's shop.|$|E
5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, as {{supplied}} from the printers in London, with a watermark of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> into the printing machines.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> by ducts in each wing root.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} with 141 multiparous pregnant sows {{was conducted to}} investigate whether the supply of glucogenic energy {{at the end of}} pregnancy may be insufficient for an optimal growth of the foetuses in sows that <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> a diet {{with a high level of}} non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and low level of starch. Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> one of three diets from day 85 of pregnancy until parturition: : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet. The daily intake of starch and sugar was 500 g. : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same diet in the same amount as the sows in treatment 1 plus an extra daily amount of 500 g starch from wheat starch (is glucogenic energy). This means that the sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> 0. 58 kg/d extra wheat starch (is 6. 73 MJ glucogenic NE) during the last month of pregnancy. : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same diet in the same amount as the sows in treatment 1 plus an extra daily amount of 200 g soya oil (is 6. 73 MJ lipogenic NE). This treatment was added because otherwise it will not be clear whether energy or glucogenic energy is thelimiting factor. : :From day 1 of day 85 of pregnancy all sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet. During lactation all sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same lactation diet. Effects on litter performance, on changes in body weight and backfat thickness of the sows, and on feed intakeduring lactation were studied. The supply of extra dietary starch or extra dietary fat in late-pregnant sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet did not increase litter weight at birth. This suggests that sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet received sufficient glucogenic energy for foetal development. : :The number of stillborn piglets was numerically higher in sows that received extra dietary fat at the end of pregnancy. Sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> extra dietary starch or extra dietary fat increased more in weight and backfat thickness during late pregnancy than sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet. Decreases in weight and backfat thickness during lactation were similar for the three experimental treatments. Voluntary feed intake during lactation was slightly decreased in sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> extra starch or extra fat in late pregnancy. :The present study shows that late-pregnant sows can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet without adverse effects on litter weight at birth. A daily intake of 500 to 600 g starch and sugar in latepregnant sows seems sufficient for optimal growth of the foetuses...|$|R
5|$|The fire <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> {{not merely}} by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)).

5|$|The maltings were {{constructed}} to designs by Herbert A. Couchman, Bass & Co.'s chief engineer. Built in red brick with Welsh slate roofing, the complex follows a rectangular plan along an east-west orientation: a central four-storey water tower {{is flanked by}} four malthouses. Behind the tower is a tall, octagonal chimney. The malthouses are identical in design and layout; barley <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> into a granary section, before being moved onto the germination floors and eventually transported {{to one of the}} twin kilns, where malting took place. Their southern fronts consisted of a six-storey building of five bays with a gable spanning three windows that faces the other ranges. Projecting northwards is a ten-bay section of four-storeys which formed the germination floors.|$|E
5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing. The processed wet fabric, soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E

50|$|The Holland Lop rabbit should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> {{daily with}} good quality pellets, fresh vegetables, and {{unlimited}} grass or timothy hay, {{as well as}} fresh water. Pellets should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> one ounce per pound of body weight. Rabbits enjoy {{many different types of}} fresh vegetables, such as romaine lettuce, endives, parsley, coriander, dill, fennel and arugula, as well as carrots. Fresh leafy vegetables should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> at a rate of at least 1 packed cup per 2 pounds of body a day.

5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Although March {{considered}} quitting Formula One {{on several}} occasions, money was always found to support {{at least one}} car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley {{spent much of his}} time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as Williams and Penske. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in Formula One ended the same year.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, major {{advances}} {{were made}} in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds {{from the effects of}} oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems, and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first all-welded merchant vessel, M/S Carolinian, was launched.|$|E
