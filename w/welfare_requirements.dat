External debt of Asian Developing Countries continues to increase especially {{during the last three}} decades. This paper focuses on the external borrowing of South Asian countries especially after the year 2000 and the analysis is done on three major economic fronts. First the overall growth of external borrowing is studied using line chart {{and with the help of}} a regression model along with a short study on ranking of these countries among other countries of the world. Secondly the external borrowing is analysed using few indicators over a period of time from 2000. Over this analysis, the line demarcation between actual amount of borrowing and borrowing burden are delineated using the debt indicators and their graphical presentation. Finally eight economic and non-economic factors were identified and these factors were regressed with dependent variable, External Borrowing. And the type of influence and intensity of influence were analysed. The first two analysis helps us to examine the intensity of debt burden of these countries, while the last analysis helps the countries to identify the factors that influence the external borrowing of the country and to adjust those factors according to the <b>welfare</b> <b>requirement</b> of the country...|$|R

The opening of state borders to all citizens, regardless of their property status, entrenched the right to travel.

[...] For example, in 2009, legislation was passed which aimed to reduce animal suffering during slaughter and on January 1, 2012, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC came into act, which means that conventional battery cages for laying hens are now banned across the Union.|$|E
5000|$|Raising {{livestock}} and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs, is another traditional, farming activity that complements growing. Organic farms {{attempt to provide}} animals with [...] "natural" [...] living conditions and feed. While the USDA does not require any animal <b>welfare</b> <b>requirements</b> be met for a product to be marked as organic, this is a variance from older organic farming practices. Ample, free-ranging outdoor access, for grazing and exercise, is a distinctive feature, and crowding is avoided. Feed is also organically grown, and drugs, including antibiotics, are not ordinarily used (and are prohibited under organic regulatory regimes). Animal health and food quality are thus pursued in a holistic [...] "fresh air, exercise, and good food" [...] approach.|$|E
50|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} examines the way that racial composition, welfare structure, and immigrant population determine how states include immigrants in welfare. Research shows that {{a larger percentage of}} African-American recipients leads to stricter rules governing initial eligibility, less flexibility in <b>welfare</b> work <b>requirements,</b> and lower cash benefits to welfare recipients. There is also a negative relationship between cash benefit levels and percentage of welfare recipients. In analyzing the effects of PRWORA, Hero and Preuhs find that the most inclusive states offer more assistance and welfare generosity to immigrants. These states, however, face challenges in allocating funds due to a larger minority population and cut individual benefit levels per recipient. Moreover, these states assess the costs for inclusion based on racial compositions in the state. In terms of TANF benefits, the most inclusive states have had the largest decline in benefit levels. For example, California has seen a 22.6% decrease in TANF benefit levels for a family of three.|$|R

The policy was heavily criticised as distorting world trade and since 1992, the policy has moved away from market intervention and towards direct payments to farmers regardless of production, called [...] "decoupling". Furthermore, the payments are generally dependent on farmer fulfilling certain environmental or animal <b>welfare</b> <b>requirements</b> to encourage responsible, sustainable farming in what is termed [...] "multifunctional" [...] agricultural subsidies.
