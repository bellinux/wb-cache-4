50|$|Resistance welding is done {{using two}} {{electrode}}s. Each electrode comes {{into contact with}} one of the pieces being welded. The two pieces of metal are then pressed together between the electrodes. While they are being pressed an electric current is ran through them.

The current is passed through the metal until it is hot enough {{to the point where the}} two pieces melt and conjoin. As the metal cools the bond is solidified. This process requires large amounts of electricity. In most cases transformers are needed to provide enough Amps.

The ongoing need {{to reduce}} the weight of {{products}} while increasing strength has resulted in new generation steel manufacturing using special heat treatments to produce High Strength Steels (HSS) and Ultra High Strength Steels (UHSS) with up to 1700 MPa tensile strength. The high strength level of these steels {{makes it possible to}} produce structures with a considerable weight and cost reduction, and such steels have been adopted in the automotive industry and for mobile heavy equipment. Welding of UHSS is, however, not without its complications and welding processes for these steels need careful attention. For instance, their high susceptibility to cracking and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) softening are risks that need to be borne in mind when choosing welding parameters. This research work discusses the difficulties and challenges of successful welding of UHSS.

An electrical contact material should display good structural characteristics (suitable hardness, high thermal conductivity and stabilization) as well as a good functional characteristic (low electrical resistivity). It is difficult to fabricate such a contact material with all these good performing parameters by common techniques because these physical parameters influence each other. In this paper, we report a novel investigation to design and prepare silver-metal oxide composite materials according to functionally layered and graded material (FLGM) concept and meeting requirement as electrical contact material. The silver-based composite samples characterized by layered component were prepared with conventional solid-phase sintering technique. One kind of sample consists of tin dioxide and silver material, in which SnO 2 exhibits a graded distribution. Another consists of two metal oxides, cadmium and zinc oxides, and silver material, in which each layer has different metal oxide.

Design/methodology/approach - A three-dimensional multiphysical numerical model for analyzing contact problems is proposed. Electrical and thermal field equations in bulk domains are discretized with the cell method (CM). <b>Welding</b> <b>resistance</b> at contact interfaces is described locally by synthetic statistic parameters and contacting domains are matched together by a non-overlapping domain decomposition method. Contact pressure distribution is resolved by a finite-element procedure. The model is validated with 3 D FEM software package. Findings - The semi-analytical model describing the electric and thermal resistances at contact interfaces can be easily embedded in CM formulations, where problem variables are expressed directly in integral form. Compatibility conditions between contact members are enforced by a domain decomposition approach. System conditioning and computing time are improved by a solution strategy based on the Schur complement method. Research limitations/implications - The electrical-thermal analysis is not coupled strongly with the mechanical analysis and contact pressure distribution is assumed to be not depending on thermal stresses, which can be considerable near the contact area where localized joule heating occurs. Practical implications - Resistance welding processes involve mechanical, electrical, and thermal non-linear coupled effects that cannot be simulated by standard commercial software packages. The proposed numerical model can be used instead for designing and optimizing ERW processes. Originality/value - The paper shows that numerical modeling of ERW processes requires a careful prediction of the localized joule heating occurring at the electrode-material interface. This effect is resonstructed by the proposed approach simulating coupled electrical, thermal, and mechanical effects on different spatial scales...|$|E

Aluminum alloys are of interest due to their favorable cost, density, strength, and production methods, leading to improved fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions when such alloys are used to reduce the weight of automobiles and trucks. The alloys 5754 (Al- 3 Mg) and 6111 (Al- 1 Mg- 1 Si) are used as inner and outer automotive body panels, respectively, and overlapping sheets are frequently joined together using resistance spot <b>welding.</b> <b>Resistance</b> spot welding (RSW) {{is one of the}} most widespread and practical joining techniques in the automotive industry for sheet metal components. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the propagation behavior of short cracks within the spot welds. This investigation provides insight into the factors affecting propagation of physically short cracks within the spot weld regime and applies that information to develop a new approach for modeling joint durability. 	Short crack propagation rates in the parent sheet materials were found to be similar for the two aluminum alloys. However, crack propagation rates in the RSW regions were observed to be as much as 100 x faster than the parent alloys. This was determined to be due to the interactions of cracks with pores that form in the weld fusion zone. A unified, dislocation based short crack model was modified to account for this effect. The short crack data was incorporated into an analytical master fatigue life relationship for predicting the lifetime of spot-welded components using a structural stress methodology. The durability model consists of finite element analysis calculations of structural stresses, adjusted short fatigue growth relationships and a calibration procedure based on fatigue lifetime data of aluminum RSW joints. This methodology was validated by application to experimentally determined fatigue lives of lap-shear joints in a wide variety of weld and sheet geometries in both alloys. Implementation into a full scale vehicle model can aid in the optimization of the size, location and number of RSW joints and enable weld process optimization via Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{thermoset}} composites, thermoplastic composites {{are drawing}} {{more and more}} attention by aircraft industries not only due to their excellent material properties but also due to their potentials to reduce cycle time and structure cost by using low-cost manufacturing technologies such as <b>welding.</b> <b>Resistance</b> welding has been {{regarded as one of}} the most promising welding techniques owing to the low energy consumption, simplicity of welding operation and capability for scaling up. Previous researches on resistance welding of thermoplastic composites are mainly focused on understanding the welding mechanisms and characterizing the welding qualities. The research work was aimed to gain deeper knowledge of resistance welding, in both micro-level and macro-level. In micro-level study, the specific properties that influence the welding quality were discussed, such as the surface properties of adherends, the weld line properties and the welding induced voids. In macro-level study, the emphasis was put on improving the current welding process, for both static resistance welding and continuous resistance welding. Micro-level study: 1. Resistance welding of woven fabric reinforced thermoplastic composites was investigated. Both the type of the majority fibres (warp yarns or weft yarns) and the apparent orientation of the majority fibres on the adherend surface were found to influence the failure mode and lap shear strength. Fibre sizing was found to be crucial for a good fibre-matrix adhesion, and therefore it was crucial for a good weld. 2. Other than fibre de-compaction, the residual volatiles inside the adherends was found to be a main cause of the voids in the joints for a welding process performed under a moderate welding pressure. Non-uniform void distribution was observed inside the joints, with void concentrations near the middle of weld overlap. The voids could be reduced by using pre-dried adherends or using a higher welding pressure. 3. A thinner weldline, usually obtained by using a thinner heating element, was found to be preferable to a thicker one. The relatively weaker welding quality near the edges of the joints was found to be a limitation of weld performance, but this could be improved by tailoring heat generation at the weld overlap or creating resin fillets near the edges. Micro-level study: 1. The possibility of using displacement measurement data for process monitoring and processing window definition was investigated, and it showed ability to detect voids generation and resin squeeze flow during welding and to construct processing windows. 2. The process of continuous resistance welding was analysed, and a model was developed to simulate the heat generation and heat transfer during welding.
