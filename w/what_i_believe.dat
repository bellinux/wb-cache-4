25|$|Coleman's critics, mostly DFL party leaders, {{speculated that}} his switch was {{motivated}} by his known aspirations for statewide office. As an abortion opponent and a frequent adversary of public employee unions, Coleman's positions put him {{at odds with the}} DFL Party leadership in Minnesota. In a letter to supporters announcing the switch, Coleman wrote that “while the political party I belong to changes, nothing about how I govern or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> changes at all.” He was re-elected as St. Paul Mayor in 1997, with nearly 60% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{denounced the}} {{reporting}} on these newsletters as “old news {{that has been}} rehashed {{for over a decade}} … once again being resurrected for obvious political reasons.” In a statement put out by his campaign, Paul said further that “the quotations in The New Republic article are not mine and do not represent <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> or have ever believed. I have never uttered such words and denounce such small-minded thoughts.” He blamed the articles on several ghostwriters who had contributed to the newsletters, which {{he said he did not}} edit, while he was busy practicing medicine full-time.|$|E

500|$|During the campaign, Keyes {{outlined}} {{an alternative}} to reparations for slavery. His specific suggestion was that, {{for a period of}} one or two generations, African-Americans who were descended from slaves would be exempt from the federal income tax (though not from the FICA tax that supports Social Security). Keyes said the experiment [...] "would become a demonstration project for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> needs to be done for the whole country, which is {{to get rid of the}} income tax." [...] He also called for the repeal of the 17th Amendment in order to require that U.S. Senators be appointed by state legislatures, rather than being directly elected.|$|E
500|$|Wagner {{had left}} neither a will, nor {{instruction}} on {{the management of}} the Bayreuth Festival after his death. He had written of the future: [...] "I ... cannot think of a single person who could say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> needs to be said ... there is practically no one on whose judgement I could rely". The festival's uncertain outlook was aggravated by Cosima's total withdrawal from all contact except that of her daughters and her friend and adviser Adolf von Groß. Without Cosima's participation the 1883 festival, as planned by Wagner—12 performances of Parsifal—went ahead, with Emil Scaria (who sang the role of Gurnemanz in the opera) doubling as artistic director. The cast was largely that of 1882, and Levi remained as conductor.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced.

500|$|Falk's {{enduring}} legacy {{can best}} be described as the NBA's new star-centered focus. [...] Falk's idea was that since most people bought Chicago Bulls tickets to see Michael Jordan, Jordan himself should get {{a large proportion of the}} benefit."Basketball is a hybrid between an individual and team sport", Falk is saying. [...] "Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves. In that environment, a Michael Jordan, Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans. Fans come to watch them play primarily. They create marketing opportunities, new stadiums, luxury boxes, and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money. The salary structure should be close to what it is in Hollywood, where Jim Carrey makes $16 million a film and the second star makes $2 million. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> as an economics major and as a neo-capitalist." ...|$|E

And {{it is true that}} they were designed to meet ancient evils. But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few {{at the expense of the}} many. In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced, and respected... I would follow <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.|$|E

He was certainly not learned, but he had a thorough knowledge of many things." [...] "In the lower spheres of diplomacy Mr Kruger was a master", EB Iwan-Müller asserted. [...] "He was quick in detecting the false moves made by his opponents, and an adept in turning them to his own advantage; but of the large combinations he was hopelessly incapable. To secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander the prospects of the future, if, indeed, he had the power of forecasting them. He was <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> soldiers would call a brilliant tactician, but a hopeless strategist." [...] Soon after Kruger's death, Smuts told the British humanitarian campaigner Emily Hobhouse: [...] "He typified the Boer character both in its brighter and darker aspects, and was no doubt the greatest man—both morally and intellectually—whom the Boer race has so far produced. In his iron will and tenacity, his 'never say die' attitude towards fate, his mystic faith in another world, he represented what is best in all of us." ...|$|E

I think it is a freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, that’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> visual kei is." [...] Upon former guitarist hide's death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, Billboards Steve McClure declared it [...] "the end of an era", explaining [...] "X were the first generation of visual kei bands For the next generation of bands, it's like: That's it.

500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles. The Orioles were coming off their first last-place finish in Baltimore, but Ripken expressed confidence in the team {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season, saying, [...] "I know these guys can get the job done. I may be hardheaded, but that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> We'll be a competitive team." [...] The Orioles got off to a slow start in April 1987, going 9-12 while losing seven of nine games in ones stretch. However, the ballclub would improve in May, moving over [...]500 while setting a May record with 56 home runs. In June, the team fell out of contention, dropping to 28-36, their worst start since 1955. Pitching plagued the club; Harvey Rosenfeld wrote it was [...] "the root cause of the Orioles' problems. In 1987, Ripken became the first—and only—father to manage two sons simultaneously in the majors, as his son Billy was called up at the All-Star break. Ripken managed Cal Jr. and Billy for the first time on July 11, in a 21 loss to the Minnesota Twins. The Havre de Grace Record wrote, [...] "The Ripkens of Aberdeen became the first family of sports." [...] On September 14, during a 173 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, Ripken substituted Cal Jr. with Ron Washington after the eighth inning, ending Cal Jr.'s major-league record streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Senior said after the game, [...] "I've been thinking about it for a long time. I wanted to take the monkey off his back. It was my decision, not his." [...] The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East at 6795, setting a team record with 51 home losses.|$|E
