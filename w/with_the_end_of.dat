5|$|After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, the Prussian-dominated North German Confederation {{adopted a}} tricolour of black-white-red as its flag. This flag {{later became the}} flag of the German Empire, formed {{following}} the unification of Germany under the Prussian king who became emperor in 1871, and was used until 1918 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the First World War. Black, white, and red were reintroduced as the German national colours with the establishment of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in 1933, replacing German republican colours with imperial colours until the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|An Unforgettable Summer was {{especially}} {{noted for its}} depiction of oppression, nationalism and xenophobia, and for its investigation of violence in both interwar Romania and the Balkans. It is also connected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Communist Yugoslavia and {{the onset of the}} Yugoslav wars: Lucian Pintilie once stated that he had been inspired by this outcome when filming on location, and continued to refer to it in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald's {{period as}} {{archbishop}} coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Wilfrid's long struggle {{to regain the}} Bishopric of York, and the two-year delay between Theodore's death and Berhtwald's election {{may have been due}} to efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in 705. Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Federation caused his Cabinet's support {{for him to}} waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction {{with him on the}} grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|Following this, No. 6 Commando {{were used}} in the defence of the beachhead and the {{subsequent}} operations to break out from Normandy before being withdrawn {{with the rest of the}} brigade back to the United Kingdom in September 1944. In January 1945, they took part in the Allied counterattack during the Ardennes Offensive before joining the advance into Germany as part of Operation Plunder. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> hostilities, the unit was disbanded in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Horse remains {{dating to}} the later part of this period– roughly coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the last glacial period– have been found at Farndon Fields, Nottinghamshire, dating from around 12,000BC. Mother Grundy's Parlour, also in Creswell Crags, {{contains}} horse remains showing cut marks indicating that hunting of horses occurred there around 10,000BC. A study of Victoria Cave in North Yorkshire produced a horse bone showing cut marks dating from about the same time.|$|E

50|$|A {{scene from}} the movie Chinatown is showing on the {{television}} in the kitchen when Carmela tells Tony they are late to meet Finn's parents. It is then replaced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film Scrooge.|$|R
5|$|In 1965, racial, political, and {{personal}} tensions led to Singapore seceding from Malaysia and becoming an independent country. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the confrontation, the last Vbombers were withdrawn in 1966. The following year, the British government announced {{its intention to}} withdraw its forces from East of Suez. The Singapore Naval Base was {{handed over to the}} government of Singapore on 8 December 1968, and Sembawang Shipyard subsequently became the basis of a successful ship repair industry. The Red Beards were returned to the UK via the US in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, war-weariness had set {{in among}} the Venetians, who {{suffered}} from the disruption in trade. Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable to the Republic. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the war between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, especially from the French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
50|$|From 1992 to 1998 the Regiment {{went through}} as period of {{significant}} decline as the annual intake of national servicemen dried up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> conscription. In 1998, the Regimental muster was only four strong.|$|R

5|$|Moore's {{law is the}} {{empirical}} observation {{that the number of}} transistors in a microprocessor doubles every 18 to 24months. Despite power consumption issues, and repeated predictions of its end, Moore's law is still in effect. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> frequency scaling, these additional transistors (which are no longer used for frequency scaling) can be used to add extra hardware for parallel computing.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, {{the newest}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the German High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.

5|$|On October 3, the Yugoslav Navy renewed its {{blockade}} {{of the main}} ports of Croatia. This move followed months of standoff for JNA positions in Dalmatia and elsewhere {{now known as the}} Battle of the barracks.

5|$|One of Len Waters' brothers, Donald Edward (Jimmy) Waters, {{had served}} as an infantryman with the Australian Army during the war. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific War in September 1945, Len {{considered}} volunteering for the Australian component of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, if his brother did also.

5|$|Others {{were injured}} and their deaths years later may have {{resulted}} from their radiation exposure. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> World War II, the work to build additional nuclear devices was less urgent, and the accident halted work for a while until increased safety protocols were implemented at Los Alamos. The incident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.|$|E
5|$|Tea & Sympathy is {{the debut}} solo album by Australian {{musician}} Bernard Fanning. It {{was released on}} 31 October 2005 by Dew Process records while PowderfingerFanning's main bandwere on hiatus. Contrary to Powderfinger's usual alternative style, the album blends alternative and country-folk music. Most of the record was written after the cancer related death of his brother in 2002. His brother's death coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Fanning's twelve-year relationship with his partner and both events were instrumental in his move away from his typically political and socially lyrical subject matter.|$|E
