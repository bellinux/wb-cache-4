5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal {{choices for}} the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> part and insisted on Assante; he thought the charm and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E
5|$|Development of Final Fantasy X-2 {{began in}} late 2001 in {{response}} to the success of Final Fantasy X, particularly fan reaction to the Eternal Calm video included in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy X International. It was released in Japan shortly before the merger between Square and Enix. The game's eventual name, X-2, was initially not liked by the production team, but it was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of X and thus could not be the next numbered title in the series. Kazushige Nojima, the previous game's writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. Something he was particularly averse to originally was the happy ending, which he felt was <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> story. The production team was one third the size of the previous installment. This was because the team was already familiar with the material and it allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. In designing the game, a significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs from Final Fantasy X were reused. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has explained that this allowed the game to be developed in one year and at half the normal scope Final Fantasy titles are normally produced. Maya and Softimage 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics.|$|E

His counsel Raja Aziz Addruse had submitted before the Court of Appeal that it was <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian government to compel him to produce the documents, because he was entitled to enter and live in Malaysia {{by virtue of the}} peace agreement.|$|E
25|$|In the pilot, Sookie {{was played}} by Alex Borstein {{but she could}} not be {{released}} from her Mad TV contract. She was therefore replaced by Melissa McCarthy, who re-filmed Sookie's scenes. The role of Dean also changed after the pilot, with the original actor replaced by newcomer Jared Padalecki. The character Lane was based on Sherman-Palladino's friend and fellow producer Helen Pai; Japanese-American actress Keiko Agena was cast in the role when they could not find an appropriate Korean-American actress. Liza Weil auditioned to play Rory, and while she was considered <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> part – Sherman-Palladino liked her so much that she wrote the role of Paris specially for her.|$|E

25|$|The {{omissions}} {{of individuals}} {{are generally not}} criminalised in English criminal law, subject to situations of special duty, contractual duty, {{and the creation of}} dangerous situations. Whilst other jurisdictions have adopted general statutory duties to rescue, it is not recognised in English law that an individual has any duty to assist strangers in situations of peril. Proponents of the current legal position regard it as <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> criminal law to punish individuals for committing no physical act, which it is argued would be an infringement on human autonomy. Academics arguing for reform argue that a social responsibility to assist others should exist, particularly where there would be no danger to the rescuer.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of a barbiturate induction agent and a nondepolarizing paralytic agent is used in thousands of anesthetics every day. Supporters {{of the death penalty}} argue that unless anesthesiologists have been <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last 40 years, the use of pentothal and pancuronium is safe and effective. In fact, potassium is given in heart bypass surgery to induce cardioplegia. Therefore, the {{combination of}} these three drugs is still in use today. Supporters of the death penalty speculate that the designers of the lethal-injection protocols intentionally used the same drugs as used in everyday surgery to avoid controversy. The only modification is that a massive coma-inducing dose of barbiturates is given. In addition, similar protocols have been used in countries that support euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 2008, {{the project}} was agreed upon by the State, the General Council of Rhône, the Grand Lyon, SYTRAL and the {{municipality}} of Décines for construction with approximately €180million of public money being used and between €60–80million coming from the Urban Community of Lyon. Since the announcement, however, the club's efforts to get the stadium off the ground has been hindered mainly due to slow administrative procedures, political interests and various opposition groups, who view the stadium as financially, ecologically and socially <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> taxpayers and community of Décines. The project is currently on hold, but most estimate that the stadium will be completed by 2015. The official name of the stadium will be The Stade des Lumières.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe it would be <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E
25|$|In the 2015 NBA draft, the Suns drafted Kentucky {{shooting}} guard Devin Booker with the 13th pick. He {{was the youngest}} player drafted at the time by the Suns at 18 years old and debuted two days before his 19th birthday against the Dallas Mavericks. The Suns also drafted Kentucky point guard Andrew Harrison as well with their 44th pick, but they traded him immediately afterward to the Memphis Grizzlies for power forward Jon Leuer. On July 1, 2015, the Suns would retain the rights of Brandon Knight under an offer {{similar to that of}} Eric Bledsoe's, as well as sign Dallas Mavericks center Tyson Chandler to a 4-year deal worth $52 million. A day later, as a move that people at the time considered a plan to sign power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, the Suns would trade Markieff's brother Marcus Morris, Reggie Bullock, and Danny Granger to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for their 2020 second round selection. After failing to get Aldridge, the Suns would sign short-term deals for Sonny Weems, Ronnie Price, and Mirza Teletović. The Suns would also replace assistant coaches Kenny Gattison and Mark West with former player Earl Watson, Bakersfield Jam affiliate coach Nate Bjorkgren, and former Harlem Globetrotter Jason Fraser. However, things would go <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team that season on December 26, 2015 with a season-ending injury to leading star player Eric Bledsoe.|$|E
25|$|While Catherine {{used the}} {{third-party}} Gamebryo game engine, Persona 5 used a specially-created engine. Hashino {{believed that the}} new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it {{would result in a}} long wait by fans for the game. The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries so as to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware. Character modelling in general was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine tuning. The characters were originally rendered realistically like in Catherine, but this felt <b>wrong</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Persona series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them. They did something similar for the interface and menu design. In contrast to Persona 4, which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for Persona 5 enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for standard event scenes and general gameplay. Persona 5 was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.|$|E
