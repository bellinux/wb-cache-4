Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about the individual who is always <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something,</b> but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov’s unofficial artwork.|$|E

We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{recording}} sessions, the band worked on what Bono estimated to be 50 songs; the Edge said they had about 25 songs to choose from, five of which were still very much in a rough state. Bono said that the songwriting process was humbling, as some songs, [...] "you could get them halfway up the hill, three-quarters of the way up the hill. A lot of times, we just couldn't get them {{up to the top of}} the hill." [...] Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said, [...] "Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five years. We have. We've made several. We just didn't release them because we were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> that would be as good as the best we've ever done." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> really {{interesting}} to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is}} a sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E
500|$|For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post {{thought the}} film was [...] "undeniably easy on the eyes", and further added [...] "maybe too easy to prevent the mind from {{wandering}} and the lids from drooping." [...] Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces, calling them [...] "more ponderous than sensational" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from [...] "From Russia, With Love" [...] or [...] "You Only Live Twice" [...] or [...] "The Spy Who Loved Me" [...] or [...] "Moonraker." [...] This is a Bond <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> inspired to push it over the top." [...] The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that [...] "For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot" [...] although he did say that the film is [...] "slick entertainment" [...] with a tone that is [...] "consistently comic even when the material is not." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "The Brothers Grimm looks terrific, yet it remains {{essentially}} inert. You keep <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> to happen, {{and after a}} while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are two guys in the woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, you go with it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} divided into ten {{chapters}} which each act as a short story, linked {{by the use of}} {{a group of people who}} appear in each story. After spending time in bardo, the group (or jāti) are reincarnated into different times and places. While characters in each story are unique, they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked, for convenience, by the first letter of their name. The characters whose names begin with the letter K are [...] "combative, imprudent and prone to getting himself (or herself) killed" [...] and [...] "striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering". The B characters are [...] "more comfortable in the world, meliorist and optimistic" [...] and [...] "survivors, nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> better". The I characters are [...] "the ones who care, who follow the other two, and may be necessary if their works are to flourish, but who tend to the domestic and always find the world worth loving." [...] The style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect the style of writing associated with the culture being depicted. For example, the first chapter is written similarly to Monkey's Journey to the West and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism. Also, later chapters take on metafictional elements, with characters discussing the nature of history, whether it is cyclical or linear, whether they believe in reincarnation, and feelings that some people are intrinsically linked.|$|E
2500|$|Another kind of subjunctive, {{much less}} common {{than the two}} {{described}} above, is a tense with the aspect-marker -ba- (pronounced -baa- and with tones similar to the remote past tense), which means [...] "while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> else to happen": ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Zawinul co-founded Weather Report with saxophonist and Davis alumnus Wayne Shorter. Their {{first two}} years {{emphasized}} a relatively open, group improvisation format not dissimilar to what Miles Davis was doing in a more rock oriented format. However, Zawinul started making changes with their third album, Sweetnighter, stating that he was [...] "tired of <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> to happen". Funk elements such as electric bass, wah-wah pedal, etc. began to be introduced to the band's sound. With their 4th album, Mysterious Traveller, the musical forms were now through-composed similar to classical music, and the combination of jazz harmonies with 1970s groove elements helped launch the band into its most commercially successful period.|$|E
