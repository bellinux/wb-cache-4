50|$|Preparing a Bathukamma is a folk art. Women start {{preparing}} Bathukamma {{from the}} afternoon.

50|$|Size and {{geometry}} {{also plays}} a role in determining the shape of the R curve. A crack in a thin sheet tends to produce a steeper R curve than a crack in a thick plate because there is a low degree of stress triaxiality at the crack tip in the thin sheet while the material near the tip of the crack in the thick plate may be in plane strain. The R curve can also change at free boundaries in the structure. Thus, a <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> may exhibit a somewhat different crack growth resistance behavior than a narrow plate of the same material. Ideally, the R curve, as well as other measures of fracture toughness, is a property only of the material and does not depend on the size or shape of the cracked body. Much of fracture mechanics is predicated on the assumption that fracture toughness is a material property.|$|E
5000|$|Berra was {{excellent}} at hitting pitches {{outside of the}} strike zone, covering {{all areas of the}} strike zone (as well as beyond) with great extension. In addition to this <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> coverage, he also had great bat control. He was able both to swing the bat like a golf club to hit low pitches for deep home runs and to chop at high pitches for line drives. Whether changing speeds or location, pitcher Early Wynn soon discovered that [...] "Berra moves right with you." [...] Five times, Berra had more home runs than strikeouts in a season, striking out just twelve times in 597 at-bats in 1950. The combination of bat control and plate coverage made Berra a feared [...] "clutch hitter", proclaimed by rival manager Paul Richards [...] "the toughest man in the league in the last three innings". Contrasting him with teammate Mickey Mantle, Wynn declared Berra [...] "the real toughest clutch hitter", grouping him with Cleveland slugger Al Rosen as [...] "the two best clutch hitters in the game".|$|E
50|$|Large clammyweed is a {{small to}} large sticky but unscented annual herb of 10-60 cm. It has {{branched}} or unbranched, green or purple stems with seated glands and glandular hairs. The 0.3-1.5 mm long, green or purple leaf stalks are often at an angle with the leaf blade. The leaf blade consists of three narrow, 0.9-3.5 cm long and only 1-2 mm wide, somewhat fleshy leaflets, {{the right and left}} halfs more or less folded towards each other (or conduplicate) with entire margins, a pointed top with a needle-like tip, the underside of the leaf with many, and the upper side with few glands. The bilaterally symmetrical flowers are set in gland-covered racemes that are initially 1-3 cm long but that keep growing to 6-8 cm when fruits are ripe. Each individual flower is subtended by a bracts consisting of one or three entire bractlets, which have an oval shape and are 7-15 mm long. The stalk of the individual flower is 1−2⅓ cm (0.4-0.9 in) long. The four deciduous, eventually deflected, green to purple coloured, hairless sepals are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped, 2½-3½ mm (0.1-0.14 in) long and ¾-1¼ mm (0.03-0.05 in) wide, with entire margins and a pointy tip. The four petals are mostly creamy white, oblong-ovate, consist of a more yellowish straight and narrow claw and a <b>wide</b> <b>plate.</b> The forward directed lower (abaxial) pair is 3-5 mm long and 2½-3 mm (0.10-0.12 in) wide the upper ⅔ deeply incised to create nine or ten finger-like lobes, often themselves bilobed at the tip (also described as a lacerate margin). The upper ((adaxial) pair is 6-11 mm long and 3½-5 mm (0.12-0.20 in) wide, less deeply incised with four to six finger-like lobes. The tube-shaped nectaries are yellow, but become purple when drying and are 1-5½ mm (0.02-0.12 in) long. There are six to fifteen stamens that reach beyond the petals, consist of purple 1-1⅓ cm (0.4-0.5 in) filaments topped by purple, 1-1½ mm (0.04-0.06 in) long anthers, which do not coil when the pollen is released. The 5-8 mm long ovary sits {{on the end of a}} gynophore that grows to a length of 3-14 mm when the fruit is ripe, and is topped with a 2½-4½ mm (0.10-0.18 in) long style that persists and ends in a green stigma. The fruit is a capsules of 2-6 cm long and ¼-½ cm (0.1-0.2 in) in diameter, with a netted surface with or without some glandular hairs. Each capsule contains twelve to forty, globular to ovate, dark reddish brown seeds of 1½-1¾ mm (0.06-0.07 in), with a nobbly surface.|$|E

40|$|Curved <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> {{testing is}} a {{valuable}} experimental tool to determine the strain capacity of flawed pipeline girth welds under tension. However, its design, test procedure and analysis are not standardized to date. In an effort to contribute to these three aspects, the authors have executed medium scale (curved) <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> tests with full field strain measurements and unloading compliance crack extension measurements. This paper discusses specifications, possibilities and limitations of both features and provides representative results. Full field strain measurements and unloading compliance analysis support the validation of a finite element model for curved <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> testing, and confirm the ability to obtain uniform strain fields in the pipe sections. It is expected that these results may contribute to a future standardization of the curved <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> test...|$|E
40|$|Strain-based {{girth weld}} defect {{assessment}} procedures are essentially based on large scale testing. Ever since the 1980 's curved <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> testing {{has been widely}} applied to determine the tensile strain capacity of flawed girth welds. However, the effect of internal pressure is not captured in curved <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> testing. Accordingly, unconservative predictions of strain capacity occur when straightforwardly transferred to pressurized pipes. To address this anomaly, this paper presents results of finite element simulations incorporating ductile crack growth. Simulations on homogeneous and girth welded specimens indicate that a correction factor of 0. 5 allows to conservatively predict the strain capacity of a pressurized pipe through <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> testing under the considered conditions...|$|E

40|$|Some {{pipelines}} face global {{plastic straining}} {{due to the}} nature of their installation process or harsh environmental conditions during operation. The ability of the girth welds to withstand these plastic strains is often evaluated on the basis of <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> tests. Key for the validity of these tests is a representative measurement of remote strain, mostly obtained by linear variable differential transformers and/or strain gauges. The outcome of the remote strain measurement depends on the specimen geometry and the position of these sensors. In an attempt to investigate a specific geometric design of <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> specimens and to find appropriate remote strain sensor positions, the authors have performed a series of tension tests on medium-sized <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> specimens, supported by digital image correlation strain measurements. In addition, finite element simulations have been performed to evaluate whether the experimental observations can be extrapolated to a wider range of conditions. The results indicate that the strain distribution is mostly influenced by the weld strength mismatch, which governs the lateral restraint. For all experiments and simulations, nevertheless, the strain field was highly uniform in an identified zone, resulting in simple guidelines regarding specimen geometry and sensor positioning...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} flutter of a {{tensioned}} elastic plate is reconsidered on {{a model of}} two-dimensional aerodynamic flow over a one-dimensional, infinitely <b>wide</b> <b>plate.</b> The purpose is to clarify the effect of variations in plate bending stiffness on the flutter of a plate under a given tension, and vice versa. On the basis that the flutter mode for the one-dimensional infinitely <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> is essentially the first plate natural mode for subsonic and low supersonic Mach numbers, and that the dynamic pressure required for flutter {{is proportional to the}} square of the first natural mode frequency, it is shown that the membrane paradox disappears for Mach numbers 0 and 1. 3, so that reduced bending stiffness reduces the dynamic pressure required for flutter...|$|E

40|$|Modeling the {{response}} of laminated composite structures to mechanical and environmental loadings is complicated, even in the elastic phase, by the multilayered material architecture {{and the presence of}} unavoidable imperfections and flaws at the layer interfaces; stress and displacement fields exhibit complex zig-zag through-thickness distributions and discontinuities. When damage begins, localized propagation of delamination cracks, which may lead to catastrophic failures, exacerbates the difficulties. The problem cannot be solved using equivalent single-layer theories or continuum damage models, and is typically tackled through discrete-layer cohesive-crack approaches and computationally expensive numerical solutions. A novel multiscale model is presented in this chapter for plates with arbitrary layups and numbers of layers and delaminations subjected to mechanical and environmental loadings. The model derives homogenized dynamic equilibrium equations which depend on a number of variables equal to that of equivalent single-layer theories, allows efficient and accurate closed form solution of problems that would otherwise necessitate a numerical treatment and sets up the bases for a more efficient numerical solution of complex problems. Explicit expressions are presented for stresses and displacements in thick and highly anisotropic <b>wide</b> <b>plates</b> with continuous imperfect interfaces and delaminations subjected to steady-state thermo-mechanical loading. Closed form solutions of the dynamic problem in simply supported <b>wide</b> <b>plates</b> highlight the important effects of the interfacial imperfections on natural frequencies and modes of vibration and frequency gaps...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the success}} of plate {{tectonics}} {{can be attributed to the}} near rigidity of tectonic plates and the availability of data that describe the rates and directions of motion across narrow plate boundaries of about 1 to 60 kilometers. Nonetheless, many plate boundaries in both continental and oceanic lithosphere are not narrow but are hundreds to thousands of kilometers wide. <b>Wide</b> <b>plate</b> boundary zones cover approximately 15 percent of earth's surface area. Space geodesy, which includes very long baseline radio interferometry, satellite laser ranging, and the global positioning system, provides the accurate long-distance measurements needed to estimate the present motion across and within <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> boundary zones.

40|$|<b>Wide</b> <b>plate</b> tension {{tests are}} {{commonly}} executed {{to investigate the}} integrity of defective welds under a uniaxial load. The specimen can be flat or curved, depending on the geometry from which it has been extracted (plate or pipe). Despite its usefulness, {{the design of the}} (curved) <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> test is still not standardized up-to-date. This paper compares two specimen designs with a different length-to-width ratio through finite element analysis, using a design-of-experiments approach to account for different influential factors. The results reveal significant differences between the interpretation of tests with net section collapse and gross section collapse, promoted by weld strength overmatch. Further, both investigated designs tend to provide similar estimates of failure mode, strain capacity and crack driving force. Hence, the shorter specimen is considered an acceptable alternative to the slightly more representative longer specimen...|$|E

A given mechanism might be an inch (25 mm) thick, possibly less, {{and more than a}} few were maybe 14 in across.

50|$|To {{minimize}} the roll diameter a four-high or cluster mill is used. A small roll diameter is advantageous because less roll is {{in contact with}} the material, which results in a lower force and power requirement. The problem with a small roll is a reduction of stiffness, which is overcome using backup rolls. These backup rolls are larger and contact {{the back side of the}} smaller rolls. A four-high mill has four rolls, two small and two large. A cluster mill has more than 4 rolls, usually in three tiers.
