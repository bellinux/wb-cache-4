Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E

25|$|In 1774, {{having given}} up the stage, he had his first {{literary}} success – a poem entitled The Tears of A Genius, occasioned by the Death of Dr Goldsmith which {{attracted the attention of}} the reading public, and from then onwards he was able to make a living by writing. By 1776 he had moved to Bath, where he entered into a part-ownership of a book-shop in Milsom Street with a partner of the name of Clinch. As with his previous professions, he soon decided that he was not suited to the life of a book-seller and returned to London within a few years. However he made many friends in Bath and became part of the fashionable Bath society, making the acquaintance of the famous actress Mrs Siddons, for whom he would later write leading character parts in his plays.
