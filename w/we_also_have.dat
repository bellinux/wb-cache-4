25|$|Now, if we're given a {{vector field}} Y over M (but not the {{principal}} bundle) but <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a connection over the principal bundle, we can define a vector field X over the principal bundle such that its horizontal component matches Y and its vertical component {{agrees with the}} connection. This is the covariant Lie derivative.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of what we}} {{know about}} the {{elemental}} composition of Mars comes from orbiting spacecraft and landers. (See Exploration of Mars for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry spectrometers and other instruments to measure the surface composition of Mars by either remote sensing from orbit or in situ analyses on the surface. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> many actual samples of Mars in the form of meteorites that have made their way to Earth. Martian meteorites (often called SNC's, for Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites—the groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a sample return mission.|$|E
25|$|In three {{dimensions}} this restates in matrix form an observation made by Euler, so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles Euler angles. However, {{the situation is}} somewhat more complicated than we have so far indicated. Despite the small dimension, we actually have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use; and <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> some freedom {{in the choice of}} angles. Thus we find many different conventions employed when three-dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics, or medicine, or chemistry, or other disciplines. When we include the option of world axes or body axes, 24 different sequences are possible. And while some disciplines call any sequence Euler angles, others give different names (Cardano, Tait–Bryan, roll-pitch-yaw) to different sequences.|$|E

25|$|Suppose that a Brownian {{particle}} of mass M {{is surrounded}} by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is {{of the order of}} 10−7cm/s. But <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.|$|E
25|$|Screens {{made up of}} {{labyrinths}} {{of complicated}} joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), {{and work on the}} tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of vine leaves and, grapes of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.|$|E

I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E

Kocher said [...] "Camping really is king here at Worlds End, and the rustic cabins are especially popular... <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> plenty of picnics and reunions, many of them drawing generation after generation, year after year". Worlds End State Park has three options for visitors interested in staying overnight. There are 19 rustic cabins, each with a refrigerator, stove, fireplace, table with chairs, and beds. There is a 70-site tent and camper campground along Pennsylvania Route154. Some of the campsites have an electric hook-up, {{and there is a}} central shower facility with water and restrooms located nearby. Three organized group tenting areas, each capable of accommodating 30 people, are also available north of the cabins. They may also be used for one large group of up to 90 campers. Non-denominational Christian worship services, sponsored by the Pennsylvania Council of Churches, are held in a wooded chapel at the park on Sunday mornings during the summer.|$|E
