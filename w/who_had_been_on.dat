5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly {{from outside the}} Solar system. (Many cosmic rays are {{kept out of the}} Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, the Jubilee Rink burned down, forcing the Canadiens to build Mount Royal Arena as a replacement. The team also lost their star player Malone, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> {{loan from the}} dormant Bulldogs as Quebec rejoined the league in 1919–20. Kennedy died in 1921; he had never recovered from the 1919 flu. His widow sold the team to Leo Dandurand, former player Joseph Cattarinich and Louis A. Letourneau.|$|E

5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E

5|$|In March the 49th (West Riding) Division (nicknamed The Polar Bears), <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the Nijmegen Island since November, {{came under}} the command of I Canadian Corps. On 2 April the division, {{supported}} by Canadian units, led Operation Destroyer to clear the Island, carefully timing the initial attack to coincide with II Corps' clearance of the east bank of the IJssel. On 3 April elements of I Corps crossed the Nederrijn east of the IJssel and met units from II Corps in the town of Westervoort opposite Arnhem. The rest of the Island was cleared within another day and the Allies occupied the southern bank of the Nederrijn in preparation for the assault on Arnhem.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 1943, the {{division}} {{was once again}} renamed. Now known as the 77th (Holding) Division, it was responsible for retraining soldiers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> medical leave. Once recruits were fully trained, and men returning from injury retrained, they were allocated to formations fighting overseas. Notably, the formation {{was used as a}} source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group, which was fighting in Normandy. After all available British army troops left the United Kingdom for France, {{the division}} was disbanded and re-formed as a deception unit to give Germany the impression that the British army had more divisions than it did. The notional 77th Division was held in reserve within the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Rescue {{workers at}} the World Trade Center site began to {{discover}} body fragments from Flight11 victims {{within days of the}} attack. Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats and discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands bound, suggesting the hijackers might have used plastic handcuffs. Within a year, medical examiners had identified the remains of 33victims <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> board Flight11. They identified two other Flight11 victims, including purser Karen Martin, in 2006, while other unrelated body fragments were discovered near Ground Zero around the same time. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} file suit over the {{election}} was Judge William M. Harrison, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the Brooks ticket. He filed a Bill of Equity with the US Circuit Court in Little Rock, claiming he {{had a right to}} a seat on the Supreme Court due to the fraudulent election. The Brooks Campaign likewise filed suit in the Circuit Court shortly thereafter on January 7, 1873. Judge H.C. Caldwell heard the Harrison case, and rendered an opinion stating that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. The Harrison decision resulted in the dismissal of the Brooks case as well.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{preceded by}} the escape of seven POWs on 30 August 1944. The organisers of the escape were Private Ralph Frederick Churches, an Australian Army {{infantry}} soldier of the 2/48th Battalion <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> temporary duty with Headquarters ANZAC Corps when he was captured during the Allied withdrawal from Greece in April–May 1941, and Driver Leslie Arthur Laws, a British Army soldier of the 127th (Dorset) Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Engineers. By August 1944, Churches had already attempted to escape on two occasions and had learned about the surroundings from those experiences. He realised {{that he had to}} escape while the prisoners were in an environment hostile to the Germans. Churches had learned to speak passable German during his captivity, and had been the camp leader of the work camp for eighteen months when he resigned the role so he could be involved in the escape.|$|E

5|$|Christian Jones led {{the team}} in {{combined}} tackles with 87. Outside linebackers Lamarr Houston (8), Willie Young (6.5) and Pernell McPhee (6) recorded a combined 20.5 sacks, becoming one of only five defensive trios with at least six sacks per player in 2015. Houston, coming off a season-ending ACL injury in 2014, converted from defensive end to outside linebacker; he did not play much during the early portion of the season until Jared Allen was traded. He played only four snaps against the Vikings, but recorded 28 tackles, five sacks and six TFLs in from week nine to fourteen. In the final nine games, he had seven sacks, the sixth-most in that stretch. Young, who also switched from DE to OLB, recorded a sack in five consecutive games (weeks eleven to fifteen), the third player in franchise history to do so after Steve McMichael and Brian Urlacher. In the first seven games of 2015, McPhee recorded five sacks, 42 tackles and seven TFLs, while Sam Acho had 60 tackles, three TFLS, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Meanwhile, inside linebackers Christian Jones and Shea McClellin had the second- and third-most tackles for the Bears with 96 and 96, respectively. Rookie John Timu, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> special teams and the practice squad until becoming a starter for the final three games, recorded 25 tackles and two fumble recoveries.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> a {{leave of}} absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E
5|$|While on the trip, he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E
