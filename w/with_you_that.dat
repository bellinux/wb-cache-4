500|$|Though former Nickelodeon {{president}} Albie Hecht, a Jewish person himself, was dumbfounded by {{the accusation}} and deemed it absurd, Herb Scannell, {{president of the}} company in 1998, responded to the complaints and apologized to ADL. Scannell issued a statement promising that neither the strip nor the character would ever be published again. In the statement, he also noted, [...] "Unfortunately, the creators of the strip made an error in judgment by referencing the Kaddish. I agree <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> however well-meaning, the use of the Kaddish in the comic strip was inappropriate." [...] Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, responded via a press release in which they thanked Scannell for his speedy response and commended the company in general for understanding the issue at hand; Foxman concluded by saying, [...] "We appreciate Nickelodeon’s long record of creative and quality programming and understand that it was not their intention to offend." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{military}} activity resumed {{in the winter}} of 1807, Napoleon hoped to overwhelm a Russian rear guard at Hof near Eylau, which was called [...] "Preussisch Eylau" [...] (and is now within the borders of the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast). He ordered his dragoons to take a bridge; they failed and suffered severe casualties. D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers—heavy cavalry of big men on big horses—thundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rear guard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot man in front of his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he must be willing to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: [...] "The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all of you. And I am so pleased <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I kiss all your arses." ...|$|E

John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation. Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with [...] "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary." [...] He later said, [...] "I call it his [...] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it." [...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> picture grossed $2 million.
