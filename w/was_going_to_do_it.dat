For guys to have success where it maybe goes against the grain, against the culture.... I know I {{probably}} didn't {{get a couple of}} jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the way I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it....</b> For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|Taraborrelli {{commented that}} [...] "in the end, the events {{surrounding}} 'Like a Prayer' only served to enhance Madonna's reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, someone {{who knows how to}} sell a concept." [...] Before Madonna's deal with Pepsi, pop stars in general were not given much artistic freedom by sponsors. However, Madonna {{made it a point to}} have the commercial be dictated by her. While she said that it was never her intention for Pepsi to get entangled in the controversy of the music video, Taraborrelli observed that Madonna stayed true to herself. Although the commercial intended to promote Pepsi the soft drink, she did not bother to hold even a can of the product, leading the author to comment that [...] "Madonna the pop star <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> her way, no matter what Madonna the businesswoman had agreed to do". She maintained all along that the Pepsi commercial and the music video were two different commodities and she was right to stand her ground. Taraborrelli noted that after [...] "Like a Prayer", the recruitment of pop stars and athletes to sell soft drinks became commonplace. However, none of them generated the level of excitement on par with Pepsi's failed deal with Madonna.|$|E

On July 12, at the age of 24 he committed suicide â€“ at the same age his father <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Meyrink survived his son by half a year.

2500|$|The episode {{featured}} various {{references to}} the popular culture. The episode title is taken from the official Spanish title for the series. While at the Veterans Day parade, Peter hears Herbert sing [...] "God Bless The USA" [...] by Lee Greenwood. When at the bar, Peter said he got a tattoo of the Space Shuttle on his penis and Quagmire in his head said he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and plays [...] "I Love a Rainy Night" [...] by Eddie Rabbitt. When Peter acts like a super U.S. Patriot he terminates anything associated with illegal immigration, such as arresting Brian's 85-year-old Korean Buddhist accupuncturist and discarding Stewie's Speedy Gonzales video. During the scene in which Peter and Brian are talking about immigrants, Peter says that [...] "they {{are part of the}} Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take 'em away!" [...] This is a reference to a line spoken by Darth Vader to Princess Leia in the movie Star Wars. The party Peter is invited to is the celebration of Cinco de Mayo. The scene in which Peter is hired as a babysitter of two children is a reference to the film Mary Poppins. When taking the immigration test, Peter is asked who founded America to which he replies [...] "Dick York" [...] but then quickly changes his answer to [...] "Dick Sargent". This is a reference to the two actors who played Darrin Stephens on the 1960s television show Bewitched. [...] Quagmire considers getting a tattoo {{in the shape of the}} Space Needle. John McCain is referenced. The ending to the film Dirty Dancing is referenced. While Peter is seen sacrificing a goat in the name of Toby Keith, it is seen gone and a hat slowly disappearing into the brush, is reference to Jurassic Park with the Tyrannosaurus eating the goat. Also, during that scene, Lois says [...] "Toby Keith doesn't want to be fed. Toby Keith wants to hunt." [...] is a parody of the quote [...] "T-Rex does not want to be fed, he wants to hunt." [...] in Jurassic Park. The mouse that Peter had created, [...] "Rapid Dave" [...] is a parody of the Looney Tunes character Speedy Gonzales.|$|E
