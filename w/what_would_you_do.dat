Some events in these tours sold out arenas they were held in, with attendance of more than 20,000 spectators. The tours and events resumed in 2000 to promote Double Dare 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Wallace {{moved up}} to the Winston Cup Series full-time, driving the No. 40 Dirt Devil Pontiac Grand Prix for SABCO Racing. The team got a {{considerable}} amount of television time as the team was featured on the TV show <b>What</b> <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do?.</b> He had three top-tens and a twenty-third-place points finish, but lost his ride {{at the end of the}} season. He returned to the Busch Series to drive the No. 8 TIC Financial Systems Ford for FILMAR Racing. He picked up three wins and finished fourth in points. Towards the end of the season, he was hired by Robert Yates Racing to replace the injured Ernie Irvan in the Cup series. In twelve races, he finished in the top-ten three times. In 1995, Wallace and FILMAR split time between the Cup and Busch Series. Wallace had one win with the Red Dog Ford in the Busch Series, and made eleven starts in the Cup Series in the No. 81 car.|$|E

500|$|Writing in The Times, Caitlin Moran {{said that}} the Doctor's homily to music and {{self-expression}} was [...] "the most affecting moment" [...] in the Prom, bringing [...] "what {{could have been a}} wonderful, yet surreal and overwhelming introduction to orchestral music" [...] down to [...] "a rather lovely question.

500|$|In a 1993 promotional {{interview}} for the album, Steinman reasserts {{the continuation of}} the Bat world. [...] "I didn't call it Bat Out of Hell II just to identify with the first record. It really does feel like an extension of that... It was a chance {{to go back to that}} world and explore it deeper. It always seemed incomplete because I conceived it like a film, and <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> without Die Hard 2?" [...] Meat Loaf himself was more succinct. He told an interview at the time, [...] "We called it Bat Out of Hell II 'cos that would help it sell shitloads." ...|$|E

500|$|On September 8, Johnson drew {{widespread}} negative {{attention when}} he appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe and was asked by panelist Mike Barnicle, [...] "As president, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> about Aleppo?" [...] Johnson responded, [...] "And what is Aleppo?". After a clarification from Barnicle, Johnson answered that he favored greater diplomacy with Russia and criticized U.S. support for the Free Syrian Army and Kurdish forces as well as U.S.-supported [...] "regime change." [...] Johnson's [...] "what is Aleppo?" [...] answer prompted widespread criticism. In response to charges that he was uninformed, Johnson {{said that he had}} [...] "blanked," [...] that he did [...] "understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict," [...] and that he had thought that Barnicle's reference to [...] "Aleppo" [...] was in relation to [...] "an acronym, not the Syrian conflict." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983 the {{production}} {{moved to the}} US where it played at the Hartford Stage Company in Hartford, Connecticut, directed by Mark Lamos and starring John Cullum as Hitler. At this premiere, Cullum's 25-minute speech {{at the end of}} the play was described by Mel Gussow in The New York Times as [...] "a Wagnerian intensity without resorting to histrionics" [...] that [...] "almost succeeds in that most difficult of tasks—humanizing Hitler". In World Literature Today, Bettina L. Knapp wrote that the play presented theatre-goers with the dilemma: <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with Hitler were he to surface today? Skloot noted that while the [...] "facts" [...] in Steiner's work are pure fiction, the play confronts the audience with an event that cannot be resolved with traditional [...] "logic, facticity and morality". Responding to theatre critics who objected to Hitler having the last word, Steiner said he wanted the audience to refute the former dictator's claims themselves.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} best known for the {{introduction}} of recurring character Elim Garak. Fields said of the character at the time, [...] "we didn't want to make him an out and out spy, because then <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with him after the episode? You'd have to put him in jail on Bajor. So we tread a pretty thin line." [...] Fields had decided when creating the character that the station needed a Cardassian on-board and when no-one objected to his suggestion to put him in a tailor shop, that became Garak's profession. This was a reference to The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which used a tailor shop as a front, as Fields had begun his writing career on that series. Andrew Robinson had originally been considered for the part of Odo, {{and was one of the}} final three actors vying for the part alongside Gerrit Graham and René Auberjonois. Robinson was invited back to audition for Garak, while Graham was cast as the Hunter in [...] "Captive Pursuit".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

2500|$|Oz {{supported}} Israeli {{actions in}} Gaza during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, criticizing Hamas tactic of using human shields, saying: [...] "What {{would you do}} if your neighbor across the street sits down on the balcony, puts his little boy on his lap, and starts shooting machine-gun fire into your nursery? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if your neighbor across the street digs a tunnel from his nursery to your nursery in order to blow up your home or in order to kidnap your family?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, 27 October 1912, the 18-year-old Kiyoaki and Honda {{are talking}} {{on an island}} in the {{ornamental}} lake on the estate when they see Kiyoaki's mother, her maids, and two guests: Satoko Ayakura, the 20-year-old daughter of a count, and her great-aunt, the Abbess of Gesshu. The Ayakura family is one of twenty-eight of the rank of Urin, and they live in Azabu. Kiyoaki is aware that Satoko has a crush on him, and pretends indifference to her. Shortly after they all meet, there is a bad omen: they see a dead black dog {{at the top of a}} high waterfall. The Abbess offers to pray for it. Satoko insists on picking flowers for the dog with Kiyoaki. While Satoko is alone with Kiyoaki, she blurts out: [...] "Kiyo, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if all of a sudden I weren't here any more?" [...] He is discomfited by the inexplicable question, and resents the fact that she has startled him with it.|$|E
2500|$|After Liu Yao was {{defeated}} by Sun Ce subsequently in battle, Taishi Ci originally planned to accompany Liu Yao as he fled to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) for shelter. However, Taishi Ci went into hiding in the hills at Wuhu County (蕪湖縣; east of present-day Wuhu, Anhui) and declared himself the Administrator (太守) of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡). By then, Sun Ce had conquered the territories east of Xuancheng County (宣城縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui); only the six counties west of Jing County (涇縣; north of present-day Jing County, Anhui) remained outside of Sun Ce's control. Taishi Ci headed to Jing County, where he established a base and managed to recruit the Shanyue people to join him. Sun Ce personally led his forces to attack Taishi Ci, defeated him in battle, and captured him. Later, he released Taishi Ci from his bonds, held his hand and asked, [...] "Do you still remember our fight at Shen Village? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if you captured me?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I can't be certain about this." [...] Sun Ce laughed and said, [...] "I shall manage the present-day affairs of the state together with you from this moment onwards." ...|$|E
