25|$|Legal {{recognition}} of same-sex unions in Australia takes {{a variety of}} forms depending on the jurisdiction. Under Australian federal law, same-sex couples can be recognised as de facto relationships, but have no access to marriage, civil unions or other federal relationship registration. Australian states and territories are entitled to create their own laws with respect to same-sex relationship registers and same-sex partnership schemes, with most offering civil unions or other forms of domestic partnership to same-sex couples. Same-sex couples are prevented from marrying by amendments to the Marriage Act 1961, passed in 2004 by the Howard Government and Mark Latham-led Australian Labor Party. Additionally, same-sex couples who are married in countries where same-sex marriage is legal cannot divorce within Australia <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> due to the same-sex marriage ban.|$|E
2500|$|To combat visa run, some {{countries}} have limits {{as to how}} long visitors can spend in the country without a visa, {{as well as how}} much time they may have to stay out before [...] "resetting the clock". For example, Schengen countries impose a maximum limit for visitors of 90 days in a 180-day window. Some countries do not [...] "reset the clock" [...] when a visitor comes back after visiting a neighboring country. For example, the United States does not give visitors a new period of stay <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from visiting Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean; instead they are readmitted to the United States for the remaining days granted on their initial entry. Some other countries, e.g. Thailand, allow visitors who arrive by land from neighbouring countries a shorter length of stay than those who arrive by air.|$|E
2500|$|In The Shrew, {{these lines}} are spoken by Katherina {{near the end}} of the play. Petruchio's {{response}} is to beat her and anally rape her as his [...] "gang" [...] hold her down. As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if the noise is her scream. At this point, the lights go down, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> up, Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech as if she has learned it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio. As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, [...] "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse." [...] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls. Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony. Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as [...] "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [...] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic." [...] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.|$|E
