The crew of the USS Bainbridge, the Arleigh Burke–class guided-missile destroyer that participated in the rescue of Richard Phillips from Maersk Alabama, contacted the South Park creators to commend them on the episode. Ensign Jonathan Sieg, the Bainbridge public relations officer, wrote, [...] "Pretty much everyone onboard our ship—from Captain to seaman—is {{a huge fan of}} South Park, and when <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the episode 'Fatbeard', as you can imagine, we were thrilled and very interested to watch." ...|$|E

[...] Sieg requested copies of the episode because the streaming online video was difficult to watch on the ship, and the South Park staff in return sent them a care package including several copies of the episode. On the official South Park Studios FAQ, they wrote back, [...] "No, sir, thank you. We were honored to read that, and making an episode about you kicking pirate booty was our pleasure." ...|$|E

There {{will be some}} similar features. With 50 million MS-DOS users, it shouldn't be surprising that DRI has {{heard some of the}} same requests from customers that we have." [...] – (Schulman et al. 1994).|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what about}} the voices?" [...] asked Fowler. [...] "Does this theory cover the {{whispering}} personalities <b>we</b> <b>heard?</b> What <b>about</b> 'Wilbur' and 'Maudie'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Discover America. No--that {{statement}} will hardly wash. We {{are just}} from America ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> nothing <b>about</b> it. Christopher Colombo --pleasant name--is--is he dead?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my dear raver," [...] said Templeton, laughing, [...] "the man {{believed}} {{at least}} in physical science. I am sure <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> enough <b>about</b> its triumphs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I'm sure of that. I've {{always said}} {{it was quite a}} {{pleasure}} to see you and your uncle together. And when <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> your all having to leave--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> that {{business}} from Mr. Nolan, and although you speak lightly of it, it was, he tells us, a very gallant affair indeed. But now as to this other matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are so {{generous and}} kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and can't say 'No' to anyone. <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Henshaw {{and all you}} did for him. If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you," [...] said Jo warmly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, didn't {{you deserve}} it?" [...] came from Carl Dudder. [...] "You shot off our {{fireworks}} on the Fourth of July. <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> all <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|He went in his turn, {{and when}} he was gone, the {{landlord}} came in to us. We told him the various histories <b>we</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> his trout, and he was immensely amused, and we all laughed very heartily.|$|R
60|$|Concerning Messalina, {{there appears}} to be no {{question}} but that she was a nymphomaniac, and that, while Empress of Rome, she participated in some fearful debaucheries. The question is what to believe, for much that <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her is almost certainly apocryphal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the African {{settlement}} this morning, at the hotel, and we {{went down}} there, right after dinner. We went into {{two or three of}} the houses and talked to the people, and they all told us the same thing, and one woman took us to see the queen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{cried the}} {{one-armed}} captain, Oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we didn't {{see him again}} for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards, when {{coming back to the}} Line, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought all}} this was over and done for," [...] said Shaw, busying himself with the cover, [...] "since Sir Thomas Cochrane swept along the Borneo coast with his {{squadron}} some years ago. He did a rare lot of fighting--didn't he? <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it from the chaps of the sloop Diana that was refitting in Calcutta when I {{was there in the}} Warwick Castle. They took some king's town up a river hereabouts. The chaps were full of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is most interesting," [...] Mr. Brand continued. [...] "I {{only wish}} she would speak French; {{it would seem}} more in keeping. It must be quite the style that <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about,</b> that <b>we</b> have read about--the style of {{conversation}} of Madame de Stael, of Madame Recamier." ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{speakers}} {{have discussed}} the water resource situation from several perspectives. <b>We</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the expected conflicts over water use, <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> water quality and quantity issues, and <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> from a distinguished legal scholar about the institutional environment of water allocation in the West. It is my task to turn your attention to the evaluation process wherein changes in the status quo would be considered. I come with a message quite unlikely to gladden your heart. To be blunt, I come {{to remind you of}} the conceptual and empirical difficulties inherent in a benefit-cost analysis. This is not a tirade against agency benefit-cost practices-though I will take a friendly jab from time to time. Rather it is a reminder to economists and politicians that one of our favorite analytic devices is not only theoretically weak, but operationally deficient in several important respects...|$|R
40|$|Thus {{far in the}} conference, <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> {{producers}} and parasites, opinion and outrage. Yesterday everyone except Ms. Lefaivre seemed to feel that populism was manipulative and bad. Well, I come to you today as a populist. I’m {{going to tell you}} about a project that is optimistic, sincere, and unabashedly populist. And I hope you will agree it is something good...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now do be serious. I {{wonder how}} you can joke on such a subject, with all your debts. I'm sure I feel them heavy enough, if you don't. You see Lord Ballindine was refused--I may say he was refused--before <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> that poor boy's unfortunate death. It was the very morning we heard of it, {{three or four hours}} before the {{messenger}} came, that Fanny had expressed her resolution to declare it off, and commissioned me to tell him so. And, therefore, of course, the two things can't have the remotest reference to each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then in {{a little}} while there was a dreadful trouble. A woman came to Peterboro and claimed to be Bert Williams's wife--and she was--she proved it. Bert cleared out and was never seen again in these parts. As soon as <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it Father relented, and I went right down to Peterboro to see Missy and bring her home. But she wasn't there--she had gone, nobody knew where. I got a letter from her the next week. She said her heart was broken, and she knew we would never forgive her, and she couldn't face the disgrace, so she was going away where nobody would ever find her. We did {{everything}} we could to trace her, but we never could. We've never heard from her since, and it is fifteen years ago. Sometimes I am afraid she is dead, but then again I feel sure she isn't. Oh, Camilla, if I could only find my poor child and bring her home! ...|$|E
60|$|So he told us--and {{among the}} group of {{officers}} gathered above him on the hurricane deck I saw now one, now another, turn away, and hurry out of the throng. A gentleman I had met on the voyage--Captain Weldonasked questions. 'Do you know any names of killed in the Leicesters?' The man reflected. He could not be sure: he thought there was an officer named Weldon killed--oh, yes! he remembered there were two Weldons--one killed, one wounded, {{but he did not}} know which was in the Leicesters. 'Tell us about Mafeking,' said someone else. Then <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Mafeking--the armoured trains, the bombardment, the sorties, the dynamite wagons--all, in fact, that is yet known of what may become an historic defence. 'And how many Boers are killed?' cried a private soldier from the back. The man hesitated, but the desire to please was strong within him. 'More than two thousand,' he said, and a fierce shout of joy answered him. The crowd of brown uniforms under the electric clusters broke up into loud-voiced groups; some hastened to search for newspapers, some to repeat what they had heard to others; only a few leaned against the bulwarks and looked long and silently towards the land, where the lights of Cape Town, its streets, its quays, and its houses gleamed from the night like diamonds on black velvet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't exactly find it out; I guessed it," [...] replied Peter. [...] "On my {{way here}} I saw Unc' Billy, and it {{popped into my}} head right away {{that he was one}} <b>we</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>about,</b> and must be the one. But if he eats flesh, I don't see why he isn't a member of the order of flesh eaters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On my word, count," [...] said he, [...] "you {{have caught}} {{something}} of this gift of Indian eloquence of which <b>we</b> have <b>heard.</b> But <b>about</b> these English folk. They are Huguenots, are they not?" ...|$|R
50|$|Harrell {{grew up in}} Fort Worth, Texas. When he was a teenager, {{his father}} became too ill to work and left {{his wife and son}} and moved in with his own mother in Arlington. In spite of his desperate situation, Harrell stayed focused on his {{promising}} football career, and when his coach at Polytechnic High School, <b>Wes</b> Bradshaw, <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the boy's predicament, he invited Harrell to stay with him.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{first that}} <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> this was Tricia Krause," [...] said Attorney General Lisa Madigan." [...] Madigan was {{referring}} to Crestwoods secret use of the contaminated well.|$|E
50|$|Bill Conway:And {{of course}} our major {{supplier}} of copier machines was a Japanese company. And so {{we saw the}} advantages of how many things the Japanese companies were doing. And <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Dr Deming. And so we got under way with our quality program with Dr Deming.|$|E
5000|$|The song isn't {{actually}} {{about the}} Great Salt Lake, but about Lake Murray, a reservoir in Ben Bridwell's {{home state of}} South Carolina. He explained, [...] "A lot of the imagery is about South Carolina, combined with some incidents <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> from some hilarious fuck-ups we knew from Salt Lake City." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{time when}} English poets and other publicists could always be {{inspired}} with instantaneous indignation about the persecuted Jews in Russia. <b>We</b> have <b>heard</b> less <b>about</b> them since <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> more <b>about</b> the persecuting Jews in Russia. I fear there are a great many middle-class Englishmen already who wish that Trotsky had been persecuted a little more. But even in those days Englishmen divided their minds in a curious fashion; and unconsciously distinguished between the Jews whom they had never seen, in Warsaw, and the Jews whom they had often seen in Whitechapel. It seemed to be assumed that, by a curious coincidence, Russia possessed not only the very worst Anti-Semites but the very best Semites. A moneylender in London might be like Judas Iscariot; but a moneylender in Moscow must be like Judas Maccabaeus.|$|R
6000|$|... "Row on, men; let us {{finish with}} these craft ahead before the others get out. This {{must be that}} piratical village <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about,</b> Mr. Mason, as lying up one of these creeks; that {{accounts}} for those two junks not going higher up. I was surprised at seeing them here, for they might guess that {{we should try to}} get them this morning. Evidently they calculated on catching us in a trap." ...|$|R
60|$|In the night, however, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> him thumping <b>about.</b> I got up anxiously with a candle. He {{had eaten}} some food, and {{scattered}} more, making a mess. And he {{was perched on}} the back of a heavy arm-chair. So I concluded he was recovered, or recovering.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} {{story was}} written by Danziger. Filming began on February 10, 2010 in Texas. The film was directed by Adam Kassen and Mark Kassen. Adam Kassen was quoted as saying, [...] "From the moment <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> this story, we connected to what it says about {{the current state of}} our medical industry and the flawed hero that tries to fix it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Too, too, wah, too, too, wah, wah / We are Young Judaea, {{we have a}} {{story to}} tell/ Too young for Tel Yehudah but Zionist just as well. / We started Young Judaea and we had lots of fun, fun! / But then <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> CYJ and our fun had just begun, had just begun. / Come on Young Judaea fun fun fun for you. / Come on Young Judaea fun for you and you and your mama too.|$|E

And even if reports are untrue, we do not care to accept your future deposits because you have taken unfair advantage in using our name as you have. We therefore advise you that henceforth your deposits will not be accepted, and you will favor us by closing your account." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} is gone now,' said he; but it had not gone. It {{was one of the}} tiny {{splinters}} of the glass of the magic mirror which <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about,</b> that turned everything great and good reflected in it small and ugly. And poor Kay had also a splinter in his heart, and it began to change into a lump of ice. It did not hurt him at all, but the splinter was there all the same.|$|R
40|$|Last year, we {{reported}} our first {{results on the}} determination of Gasser–Leutwyler coefficients using partially quenched lattice QCD with three flavors of dynamical staggered quarks. We give an update on our progress in determining two of these coefficients, including an exhaustive effort to estimate all sources of systematic error. At this conference, <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> algorithmic techniques to reduce staggered flavor symmetry breaking and a method to incorporate staggered flavor breaking into the partially quenched chiral Lagrangian. We comment on our plans to integrate these developments into our ongoing program. 1...|$|R
