His earliest recorded track and field results come from 1907. He also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg reached Ragusa on 24 August 1461 {{along with}} the Pal Engjëlli, the Archbishop of Durrës. His men stayed on the ships {{anchored}} in the harbor while {{he went into the}} city. Due to papal pressure, the Ragusans had reconsidered Skanderbeg's requests. His fame was visible <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> through the city-gates and the population poured into the streets to see him. He had been greeted with a ceremony and a tour of the city inspecting its walls and weaponry. He then received the financial sum he had come for. His men were also supplied with food for their coming campaign. His popularity allowed him to be well-kept by the Ragusans where the largest Albanian community outside of Albania was present. On 29 August 1461, Skanderbeg set off for Apulia, but a storm forced him to anchor off a Dalmatian island. On 3 September 1461, Skanderbeg finally reached Barletta.|$|E

25|$|Burke was omitted for {{the fifth}} time when left out of the 1955 squad to tour the West Indies. At this stage, he began to take a {{defensive}} attitude, trying to eliminate all risk in order to increase his productivity, something that prompted crowd heckling and demonstrations by Sydneysiders <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> into bat. There was also a Test opener's berth available, as one the incumbent openers Arthur Morris had retired after returning from the West Indies.|$|E

25|$|That {{lead was}} halved {{in the sixth}} through an unearned run. Elliot Biddle got on through an infield hit, and then {{advanced}} to third when Ben Wigmore dropped a fly ball in center field off the bat of Hayden Dingle. This allowed Tristan McDonald to drive Wigmore in on a sacrifice fly. Richard Bartlett entered the game to pitch for South Australia in the seventh inning, {{but was unable to}} hold on to the one-run lead he was given, allowing the tying run to score in the eighth <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> McDonald and gave up an RBI-double to Scott Wearne.|$|E
25|$|Hailing from Eastern New Orleans, Barry started {{training}} professionally in Wushu, sanshou and Kickboxing {{at the age}} of twenty-one while {{a junior}} sociology major at the University of New Orleans <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> into Russell Jones's Kickboxing Gym in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He made his professional debut on November 2, 2002 at the U.S. Open International Martial Arts Championships in Las Vegas, Nevada, winning the Sanda Kungfu Federation (SKF) United States Heavyweight Championship with a fourth round knockout over Robert Parham. He then left Jones' gym and pursued kickboxing full-time with Master Shawn Liu at LIU International in New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|The final Test of {{the series}} was the biggest {{disaster}} of all for England. They lost by an innings and 149 runs. Batting first, England were shot out for 52, of which Hutton made 30. Lindwall took 6/20. The Australian openers put on 117, and the total eventually reached 389 (Morris 196). In their second effort England managed only 188. (Johnston 4/40). It was known {{that this would be}} Bradman's final Test, and the crowd gave him an ovation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out to bat. He only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Eric Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck.|$|E

25|$|After {{a two-month}} break, Atlantic {{returned}} for the autumn meetings at Newmarket. He {{was able to}} claim prize money of £300 without having to race <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> over for the Buckenham Stakes at the First October meeting, but then finished unplaced behind Feu d'Amour in the Prendergast Stakes. On his final appearance, Atlantic was beaten a short head by Minister in the Glasgow Stakes. Atlantic's performances established him as a colt of some ability, but {{he appeared to be}} some way below the best of his generation and was not considered {{to be one of the}} major contenders for the following year's Classics.|$|E
25|$|By 1940, {{the work}} Blalock {{had done with}} Thomas placed him at the {{forefront}} of American surgery, and when he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at his alma mater Johns Hopkins in 1941, he requested that Thomas accompany him. Thomas arrived in Baltimore with his family in June of that year, confronting a severe housing shortage and a level of racism worse than they had endured in Nashville. Hopkins, like the rest of Baltimore, was rigidly segregated, and the only black employees at the institution were janitors. When Thomas walked the halls in his white lab coat, many heads turned. He began changing into his city clothes <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> from the laboratory to Blalock's office because he received so much attention.|$|E
25|$|During England's 1964–65 tour of South Africa, Barlow became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} in the third Test at Newlands after he survived a bat-pad chance when England bowler Fred Titmus thought he had had Barlow caught by Peter Parfitt in the gully. It was already an ill-tempered series, and when Barlow went on to complete his hundred it was little recognised by the England players. Instead, when Tony Pithey reached his half-century shortly afterwards, the England players went overboard in their congratulations to him, seemingly {{to make a point}} about Barlow's behaviour. The local South African papers attacked England for this, and later in the same match, English batsman Ken Barrington caused a greater furore <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> despite not being given out by the same umpire that had not given Barlow out.|$|E

25|$|This public {{demand for}} modern buildings, {{combined}} with Victorian architectural styles {{falling out of}} fashion, resulted in dozens of fine Victorian buildings like the intricate glass-roofed Birmingham New Street Station, and the old Central Library being destroyed in the 1950s and 1960s by the city planners. These planning decisions were to {{have a profound effect}} on the image of Birmingham in subsequent decades, with the mix of concrete ring roads, shopping centres and tower blocks giving Birmingham a '' tag. Manzoni's work included the construction of the Inner Ring Road, Middle Ring Road and the Outer Ring Road, which necessitated the purchase and clearance of vast areas of land. As well as this, he designated large areas of land redevelopment areas and set about clearing large areas of slums. Several architects were made the city architect of Birmingham, with the first being Alwyn Sheppard Fidler who held the position from 1952 to 1964, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out following disagreements over his design for the Castle Vale housing estate.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury. The risk paid off; Walton's {{acquisition}} helped Boston win a league best 67 games. One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout. With averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards. In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals. Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round, leading Boston to victory in six games. The '86 Celtics are commonly ranked {{as one of the greatest}} basketball teams of all-time, with the Boston Globes Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 {{he reached}} {{the quarterfinals of the}} French International Hard Court Championship partnering Béla von Kehrling; they were {{defeated}} by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926 he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm threw derogatory verbal abuses to his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who had enough and walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy and as a result an official ban was requested on the Austrian to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> off the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard the laughter of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was also upset by the count's actions and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again.|$|E
