60|$|I take it {{that when}} you asked me for a Don Juan play you did not want that sort of thing. Nobody does: the successes such plays {{sometimes}} obtain are due to the incidental conventional melodrama with which the experienced popular author instinctively saves himself from failure. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> Owing to your unfortunate habit--you now, I hope, feel its inconvenience--of not explaining yourself, I have had to discover this for myself. First, then, I have had to ask myself, what is a Don Juan? Vulgarly, a libertine. But your dislike of vulgarity is pushed {{to the length of}} a defect (universality of character is impossible without a share of vulgarity); and even if you could acquire the taste, you would find yourself overfed from ordinary sources without troubling me. So I took it that you demanded a Don Juan in the philosophic sense.|$|E
