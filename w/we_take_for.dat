500|$|The episode {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club called the episode {{one of the}} [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] of the series and cited it {{as an example of}} the series' subtle shift [...] "from a collection of monster tales to something more akin to an attempt to explain the dark underbelly of America’s obsession with pulp narratives." [...] He ultimately concluded that [...] "Field Trip" [...] showed [...] "how the series would never be as good as its best seasons again, but could still be remarkably effective." [...] In a subsequent review, VanDerWerff awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes of The X-Files sixth season" [...] due to its analysis of what Mulder and Scully each desire from the world, and the fact that the episode argues that the [...] "mysteries can only be solved if both of these people are working to solve them." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two positively compared the episode to the episode [...] "Bad Blood", noting that the episode [...] " [...] a retread of those 'Bad Blood' themes". Furthermore, however, Shearman and Pearson noted that, [...] " [...] not merely poking fun at the conventions of the long running sci-fi show, but inviting its audience to question the truths around us <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted".|$|E

2500|$|Bordwell {{has called}} the film opaque with {{characters}} {{that are difficult to}} interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses ellipses in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still heard. These techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes [...] "we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. They remind us of storytelling conventions <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted, and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them." [...] Bordwell believes that [...] "blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what we see and hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed to savor each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{called it}} a [...] "fine, moving, {{frequently}} hilarious tale" [...] and observed it [...] "is an American comedy {{of the sort of}} vitality that dazzles European film critics and <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted. It's full of attachments and associations to very particular times and places, even in the various regional accents of its characters. It's beautifully written…and acted, but it's not especially neatly tailored… At the center of the movie and giving it a visible sensibility is Miss Burstyn, one of the few actresses at work today…who is able to seem appealing, tough, intelligent, funny, and bereft, all at approximately the same moment. It's Miss Burstyn's movie and part of the enjoyment of the film is in the director's apparent awareness of this fact… Two other performances must be noted, those of Diane Ladd and Valerie Curtin… Their marvelous contributions in small roles are a measure of the film's quality and of Mr. Scorsese's fully realized talents {{as one of the best}} of the new American film-makers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{plays of}} Euripides, {{like those of}} Aeschylus and Sophocles, were {{circulated}} in written form in the 5th century among literary {{members of the audience}} and performers at minor festivals, as aide-memoirs. However, literary conventions that <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted today had not yet been inventedthere was no spacing between words, no consistency in punctuation nor in vowel elisions, no marks for breathings and accent (guides to pronunciation and hence word recognition), no convention to denote change of speaker and no stage directions, and verse was written straight across the page like prose. Possibly those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely denoted with a variety of signs, such as the equivalent of the modern dash, colon and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions, which are an aid to comprehension, was an early and persistent source of errors affecting transmission of the text. Errors crept in also when Athens replaced its old Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403–402 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by Lycurgus of Athens in 330 BC [...] "...that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not comply with this regulation should be illegal." [...] The law was soon disregarded and some actors continued to make their own changes up until about 200 BC, after which the habit dies out. It was about then that Aristophanes of Byzantium compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a commentary that was [...] "published" [...] separately. This became the [...] "standard edition" [...] for the future and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern readers expectthere was still no spacing between words, little or no punctuation and no stage directions, but abbreviated names now denoted changes of speaker, lyrics are broken into [...] "cola' and [...] "strophai" [...] or lines and stanzas, and a system of accentuation was introduced.|$|E

Nevertheless, there are certain signs by which Christ's sheep may be guessed at.

To themselves, the best proof of their being Christ's sheep is to find themselves on Christ's shoulders; and, between them, there are certain sympathies (expressed in the Apostles' Creed by the term [...] "communion of Saints"), by which they may in a sort recognize each other, and so become verily visible to each other for mutual comfort.|$|E

He was sending in his orders to his employers (he is a commercial traveller) and was smoking a cigar, when he became conscious that some one was sitting on his left, with one arm on the table.

He sprang up to embrace her (for even on meeting a stranger whom <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> a dead friend, we never realise the impossibility in the half moment of surprise) but she was gone. Mr. G. stood there, the ink wet on his pen, the cigar lighted in his hand, {{the name of his}} sister on his lips.

Presently, however, we see that, in order to observe the law of principality there is one large scarlet leaf instead of a bud, nearly half-way up, which forms a centre to the whole rod; and when we begin to examine the order of the leaves, we find it varied carefully. Let A stand for scarlet bud, b for blue leaf, c for two blue leaves on one stalk, s for a stalk without a leaf, and R for the large red leaf. Then counting from the ground, the order begins as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{critical}} remarks, therefore, prefixed and annexed to the Lyrical Ballads, I believe, we may safely rest, {{as the true}} origin of the unexampled opposition which Mr. Wordsworth's writings have been since doomed to encounter. The humbler passages in the poems themselves were dwelt on and cited to justify {{the rejection of the}} theory. What in and for themselves would have been either forgotten or forgiven as imperfections, or at least comparative failures, provoked direct hostility when announced as intentional, as the result of choice after full deliberation. Thus the poems, admitted by all as excellent, joined with those which had pleased the far greater number, though they formed two-thirds of the whole work, instead of being deemed (as in all right they should have been, even if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted that the reader judged aright) an atonement for the few exceptions, gave wind and fuel to the animosity against both the poems and the poet. In all perplexity there is a portion of fear, which predisposes the mind to anger. Not able to deny that the author possessed both genius and a powerful intellect, they felt very positive,--but yet were not quite certain that he might not be in the right, and they themselves in the wrong; an unquiet state of mind, which seeks alleviation by quarrelling with the occasion of it, and by wondering at the perverseness of the man, who had written a long and argumentative essay to persuade them, that ...|$|E
