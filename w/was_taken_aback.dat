5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback.</b> He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to the U.S., Miller became rabbi of Congregation Agudath Shalom in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Initially, the community <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by Miller's audacious pedagogy, and {{the sheer volume of}} his Torah presentations, attempting in vain to restrain his unconventional approach. Within a few years however, the community had changed their minds, desiring for Miller to stay longer.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Nixon {{arranged}} {{an interview}} with British journalist David Frost {{in the hopes of}} improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.|$|E

25|$|Captain Lee, {{who was in}} {{his private}} cabin {{at the time of}} the incident, {{immediately}} rushed to the bridge. After a short period, all the ship's mates and helmsmen arrived there as well. Around this time, the chief engineer stopped the engines, although it is unknown whether it was on his own volition or following an order from Captain Lee. At 8:50, the chief engineer ordered an evacuation of the engine room through a call to the assistant engineer. During this time, Park was crying, as she <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by the sudden incident; this lasted until at least 9:06a.m.|$|E
25|$|Emperor John IV of Trebizond {{was aware}} of the threat Mehmed II posed for him at least as early as February 1451, when the Byzantine diplomat George Sphrantzes arrived in Trebizond seeking a bride for his emperor, Constantine XI. John had happily related to the visiting diplomat the news of the death of Sultan Murad II, and that Mehmed II's youth meant that now his empire could last longer and be blessed. Sphrantzes, however, <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> and {{explained}} to him that Mehmed's youth and seeming friendship were only ploys, and that Mehmed was more of a threat to both monarchies than his father had been.|$|E
25|$|The {{general manager}} {{who would be}} {{eventually}} successful in breaking the color barrier was Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey himself had experienced the issue of segregation. While playing and coaching for his college team at Ohio Wesleyan University, Rickey had a black teammate named Charles Thomas. On one particular road trip through southern Ohio his fellow player was refused a room in a hotel. Although Rickey {{was able to get}} the player into his room for that night, he <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> when he reached his room to find Thomas upset and crying about this injustice. Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.|$|E

25|$|The {{forensics}} reinforced this theory. On {{a record}} player atop the stack was a thumb-shaped bloodstain. It had no print, suggesting whoever left it was wearing gloves to avoid leaving identification. But {{the blood was}} Rasmussen's, suggesting the equipment had been stacked after the struggle and shooting. They had been left behind, the detectives realized, to make the crime look like something other than what it really was. From the four bound volumes of the case file they developed a list of five women who might be suspects. Nuttall <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> when Ruetten told him over the phone that Lazarus was a police officer. By then, Lazarus had been promoted {{to a higher level}} of detective, and was working art theft cases as part of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD).|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, {{although}} Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by {{the severity of the}} condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His central role in the organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
25|$|After several weeks, they {{traveled}} to Amritsar, staying near the Harmandir Sahib and worshipping at a Sikh gurudwara. They also read English- and Sanskrit-language books, exposing Tagore to astronomy, biographies of such figures as Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Later, in mid-April, Tagore {{and his father}} set off for the remote and frigid Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie, India, near what is now Himachal Pradesh's border with Kashmir. There, at an elevation of some 2,300meters (7,500feet), {{they lived in a}} house high atop Bakrota hill. Tagore <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by the region's deep gorges, alpine forests, and mossy streams and waterfalls. Yet Tagore was also made to study lessons — including such things as Sanskrit declensions — starting in the icy pre-dawn twilight. Tagore took a break from his readings for a noontime meal; thereafter, Tagore was to continue his studies, although he was often allowed to fall asleep. Some two months later, Tagore left his father in Dalhousie and journeyed back to Calcutta.|$|E

500|$|... "The Darkness" [...] had {{the desired}} effect; Lineberger wrote that [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by the dark tone and {{emotional}} range generated by this episode. Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I {{cared about the}} characters as though I know them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling." [...] Abramowitz said that Tessa's death strongly angered many viewers, and that [...] "...people hated me for killing her." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1968, Stephen Lewis, as a {{supposed}} {{representative of the}} Ontario NDP legislative caucus, asked the 63-year-old Tommy Douglas to step down as leader so that a younger person could take over. Donald C. MacDonald stated that Lewis was not representing the caucus, but acting on his own. [...] Though Douglas <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by the suggestion, his defeat in the ensuing election bolstered Stephen's case and on October 28, 1969, Douglas {{announced that he would}} step down as leader before the NDP's 1971 convention.|$|E

500|$|Hokkaido {{represented}} the Japanese frontier {{at that time}} and with so much work to be done in colonizing the island, Kuroda welcomed and frequently implemented Clark’s advice. Clark submitted recommendations to the governor on such diverse subjects as converting migratory fisherman into permanent colonists and establishing a textiles industry. In fact, Clark himself <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by the apparent scope of his influence on colonial affairs, writing to his wife, “Governor Kuroda consults me constantly and always follows my advice.” He later wrote, “I tremble to think how much confidence is reposed in me and what responsibilities I am daily assuming.” ...|$|E
500|$|Before filming for {{the sixth}} season commenced, Montag {{garnered}} significant criticism after undergoing ten cosmetic surgery procedures in one day. In the premiere, she traveled to her hometown Crested Butte to unveil the results to her family. After unexpectedly receiving much disapproval, {{she and her husband}} Pratt alienated themselves from their relatives. Having later displayed additional instances of erratic and unusual behavior, their respective sisters decided to exclude them from their lives. Having dated several years prior, Cavallari and Jenner become flirtatious once more, though the former <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> after the latter started seeing another woman.|$|E
500|$|Ross {{presented}} his initial concept of deconstructed fighter jets at {{an open house}} in April, and was met with negative reactions {{from members of the}} public. The piece was criticized for its use of [...] "instruments of war", and Ross himself criticized for being a non-resident. The 43rd District Democrats passed a unanimous resolution calling for [...] "more culturally sensitive themes for public art [...] instead of warplanes" [...] and the hiring of local talent. Ross <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by the criticism, telling New York's Village Voice that he [...] "definitely didn't expect to get resistance from left-wing political activists". Cartoonist Ellen Forney, whose work would also be used at the station, defended Ross's work and called his proposal [...] "thought-provoking" [...] and [...] "something that's not 'safe' and totally public art-y".|$|E

500|$|McCarthy himself <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by {{the massive}} media {{response}} to the Wheeling speech, and {{he was accused of}} continually revising both his charges and figures. In Salt Lake City, Utah, a few days later, he cited a figure of 57, and in the Senate on February 20, he claimed 81. During a five-hour speech, McCarthy presented a case-by-case analysis of his 81 [...] "loyalty risks" [...] employed at the State Department. It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy's cases were selected from the so-called [...] "Lee list", a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the House Appropriations Committee. Led by a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent named Robert E. Lee, the House investigators had reviewed security clearance documents on State Department employees, and had determined that there were [...] "incidents of inefficiencies" ...|$|E
500|$|Montcalm <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> {{to learn}} of the British deployment, and his {{response}} has been regarded as precipitate. Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville's column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe's force directly. [...] Had he waited, the British would have been entirely cut off—they {{had nowhere to go}} but back down the Foulon, and would have been under fire the entire way. To an artillery officer named Montbelliard, Montcalm explained his decision thus: [...] "We cannot avoid action; the enemy is entrenching, he already has two pieces of cannon. If we give him time to establish himself, we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Szigeti met Leopold Stokowski {{and played}} the Bach Chaconne in D minor for him. Less than two weeks later, Szigeti {{received}} a telegram from Stokowski’s manager in Philadelphia inviting him to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra later that year: it was his American debut. Szigeti had never played with an American orchestra before, nor heard one, and later he wrote of suffering stage fright. He <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> by the American concert scene, {{and the way that}} its publicity and popularity driven agents and managers determined much of what was heard in American concert halls. He believed they were not interested in works by the great masters, but preferred the popular light salon pieces he had left behind in his prodigy days. (To the end of his life, Szigeti loved to quote one memorable, cigar-chewing impresario who told him, with regard to Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, [...] "Well, let me tell you, Mister Dzigedy—and I know what I’m talking about—your Krewtzer Sonata bores the pants off my audiences!") ...|$|E
