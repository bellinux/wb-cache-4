25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{contains}} {{a total of}} six books. It was originally to be called [...] "The Clawed Path," [...] as the journey the four bears make through all six books in the series is referred to as [...] "the clawed path." [...] At the very last moment, the title was changed so that it would look similar to the Warriors series. Holmes was initially unhappy with the change, but has since said that she has come to like it and the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> on the books.|$|E
500|$|Golan shelved the low-budget rewrites and {{attempted}} to finance an independent production from the original big-budget script, already budgeted, storyboarded and laid out. At Cannes in May 1989, 21st Century announced a September start date, with ads touting the script by [...] "Barney Cohen, Ted Newsom & John Brancato and Joseph Goldman." [...] As standard practice, Golan pre-sold the unmade film to raise production funds, with television rights bought by Viacom and home video rights by Columbia Pictures, which wanted to establish a studio franchise. Stephen Herek was attached as director at this point. Golan submitted this [...] "new" [...] screenplay to Columbia in late 1989 (actually the 1985 script with an adjusted [...] "1989" [...] date) and the studio requested yet another rewrite. Golan hired Frank LaLoggia, who turned in his draft but grew disenchanted with 21st Century. Neil Ruttenberg was hired for one more draft, which was also [...] "covered" [...] by script readers at Columbia. Columbia’s script analysts considered all three submissions [...] "essentially the same story." [...] A tentative production deal was set. Said Stan Lee in 1990, [...] "21st Century [...] supposed to do Spider-Man and now they're talking to Columbia and the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> now, Columbia may end up buying Spider-Man from 21st Century." ...|$|E
50|$|At the time, {{this was}} the second thing for Virgin and so I wrote No. 2 on it, and I just liked the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked.</b> My second band; that's it.|$|R
50|$|During the World War II {{although}} much of the city was destroyed or damaged, the market did not suffer much damage. The square was restored according to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> in the late 18th century, using Baroque and Classicism styles.|$|R
5000|$|Healthcare Insurance Reciprocol of Canada (HIROC), [...] Canada's leading {{provider}} of healthcare liability insurance, developed a company-wide Integrated Risk Management tool using Datix. Based on academic research and subscriber feedback, HIROC revolutionized the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> at risk. Data {{from the system}} can {{form the basis of}} academic research into patient safety issues.|$|R

6000|$|... "Neither do I; but that's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to me. Must {{be nice to}} {{be where}} there's grass, so's you can {{get up in the}} mornin' an' run 'round in the fields." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{these guys}} are going to dig it up. That's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to me." [...] He lowered his voice. [...] "Say, I saw Clarice last night," [...] he said in a {{confidential}} undertone. [...] "It's all right." ...|$|E
5000|$|B is typeless, or more {{precisely}} has one data type: the computer word. Most operators (e.g. , , , [...] ) treated this as an integer, but others treated it as a memory address to be dereferenced. In many other <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> a lot like {{an early version of}} C. There are a few library functions, including some that vaguely resemble functions from the standard I/O library in C.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 a {{decision}} was made to do yet another major remodeling of the museum. The station building was closed in September 2003, gutted, and then largely restored to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> in the 19th century, with the addition of the [...] "Royal waiting room" [...] moved there from the [...] "Staatsspoor" [...] railway station of The Hague, which was demolished in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|Mountaineering camp of Mitrovićev dom. It {{was made}} of wood and stone and named (“Mitrović Home”) after dr Dušan Špirta Mitrović, a medical doctor and {{volunteer}} on the Salonika Front. In 1981 it was declared a cultural monument but in 2014 it {{burned to the ground}} in the fire. In 2016-17 it was reconstructed to look exactly the same <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> before the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it is, mamma. It loves me, I know, by the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> at me {{with its}} {{beautiful}} black eye. What a pity the other is not so nice! I think the poor darling must be blind of that eye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{expect a}} cogency of conduct not usual in women," [...] said Marlow. [...] "The subterfuges of a menaced passion {{are not to}} be fathomed. You think it is going on the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks,</b> whereas it is capable, for its own ends, of walking {{backwards}} into a precipice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ours are sovereign, but not English," [...] Andrew replied. [...] "One's {{strictly}} Canadian, another frankly Australian, and so on. We're an individualistic race, and our different branches {{grow their}} own <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> like a loose arrangement, but we've found we hold together well. You'll see when the bulletin comes out--if it's what I expect." ...|$|E
60|$|This is the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> all <b>looks</b> {{and seems}} to me, sitting over under the big hemlock, out of sight, and {{watching}} the birds through my field-glass.|$|R
60|$|Bell {{made some}} calculations. His money was getting short; he had bills to pay, and his stock of coal was large. He {{could not hold}} it much longer, and since the Askews were {{bringing}} down large quantities of peat, there was no ground for imagining the dalesfolk would give <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> as if he must meet them and he wrote a notice that coal would be delivered by the trailer lurry at a reduction of two-and-six a ton.|$|R
50|$|The City of Decatur {{completed}} renovation in the Sexton Lobby and in {{the future}} to restore The Princess to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> during the time period of the 1950s and 1960s. This includes removing paint that covers the murals painted by Albert Frahn. Efforts have created a large reception area adjacent and connected to the main theatre. It includes additional second floor access, concessions, restrooms, dressing rooms, as well as a second entrance to the building was completed in April 2009.|$|R
6000|$|... "What Roger says is true," [...] said Dave, gravely. [...] "I {{am sorry}} for you, Nat, {{but that is}} the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to us. He was seen around the old stone bridge when it was blown up, and around the shanty where the {{dynamite}} was kept, and he has been in Oakdale several times, so we have heard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come this <b>way!</b> <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> to me {{as though}} Ninety-four was slackenin' up!" [...] Master Bartlett cried as he darted forward, and Dan readily {{followed}} the advice, for while he did not approve of his friend's devotion to the Fire Department, he understood full well that Seth was thoroughly conversant with all such matters as might be learned by an outsider.|$|E
6000|$|... "In one <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like that, but, after all, a jibe's quite {{a common}} {{thing with a}} fore-and-after. If you run her off to lee when she's going before it her mainboom's bound to come over. Of course, nobody would run her off in a wicked breeze unless he had to, but you'd no choice with the ice in front of you." ...|$|E
50|$|The Victory was {{the first}} theater to be {{restored}} {{in an effort to}} revitalize 42nd Street and Times Square, and between 1994 and 1995 it underwent an $11.4 million renovation headed by Hugh Hardy of the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. The restoration included rebuilding the original exterior double staircase that had been removed in 1911 for the widening of West 42nd Street, and returning the rest of the theater to much the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> during the Belasco era.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1973 {{a replica of the}} Thomas Stretch clock was {{restored}} to Independence Hall. The $159,000 replica included a 14-foot copy of the clock case atop a 40-foot soapstone column, just the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> during the Revolutionary War. To lessen danger of deterioration, the original delicate wood carvings were instead cast in polyester bronze. The only major concession in modernism: the clock, with an eight-foot dial painted red-brown and Persian blue, is powered by electricity rather than wooden works and weights.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the {{building}} {{was in the process}} of being converted into 145 luxury apartments. A plan for condominiums was considered but dropped. Nissen Risk Capital LLC and HRI, using Holder Construction Co. as general contractor, began work in Summer 2004. Little Diversified Architectural Consulting and Acanthus Architecture Group provided architectural expertise. The lobby was being restored to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> when {{the building}} was new, including a granite floor and brass on steel elevator doors. A pool has been added to the roof.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very awkward," [...] Wyndham agreed, {{with some}} dryness. [...] "In a <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> {{too big for}} us. To begin with, {{we have got to}} pay duties we dodged, and satisfy the Government we cheated. Then, without {{exciting}} the latter's curiosity, we're going to stop a rebellion and carry off its leader. There's the worst puzzle. The fellow's cunning and powerful. Moreover, he's my uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, lad, that's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to {{a decent}} man; but sich fellows as these {{here who are}} makin' a row, are the ones who're always lookin' ahead, thinkin' matters may be bettered, an' regardin' not the {{possibility}} of their growin' worse. Here they are, like to come on short allowance, an' obleeged to take their turn at bein' shot at now an' then, consequently, not havin' the heart to endure even the lightest sufferin', they say we can't be any worse off, an' ought to surrender." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It looks {{partly as}} if it were made of {{poisonous}} smoke; very possibly it may be: {{there are at least two}} hundred furnace chimneys in a square of two miles on every side of me. But mere smoke would not blow to and fro in that wild <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> more to me {{as if it}} were made of dead men's souls--such of them as are not gone yet where they have to go, and may be flitting hither and thither, doubting, themselves, of the fittest place for them.|$|E
5000|$|Diamandis {{also stated}} that Froot was not entirely dark and that [...] "it's almost celebrating being happy". The album is {{described}} as considerably [...] "reflective" [...] in comparison to her previous releases, and {{is said to be}} [...] "centred around extremely different things; half of the album is about a relationship that I had to end". The singer declared the word [...] "Fruit" [...] was spelled as [...] "Froot" [...] because she liked the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked,</b> especially since the [...] "O"s could interlink.|$|R
5000|$|The match (German: [...] "Anschlussspiel") {{was dubbed}} {{as a game}} for celebrating the Anschluss and Austria's [...] "coming home to the Reich". The Austrians played on the wish of Sindelar in red-white-red kits (the {{national}} flags colours) instead of their traditional white and black.Austria missed out many sitters in a <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> deliberate. However, in the last 20 minutes, Sindelar and team-mate Karl Sesta both scored as the game finished 2-0.Sindelar is reported [...] to have celebrated extravagantly in front of senior Nazi dignitaries.|$|R
60|$|Was ever any {{one in a}} worse {{position}} than Jumper the Hare? To move would be to give himself away to Whitey the Snowy Owl. If he remained where he was very likely Shadow the Weasel would find him, and {{the result would be}} the same as if he were caught by Whitey the Owl. Neither Whitey nor Shadow knew he was there, but it would be only a few minutes before one of them knew it. At least, that is the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> to Jumper.|$|R
60|$|The {{difference}} between jay and daw {{is similar to}} that between fox and dog; or rather let us say, between one of the small desert foxes of Syria and Egypt--the fennec, for instance--and the jackal, the domestic dog's progenitor; the first gifted with exquisite grace and beauty, was too highly specialized to suit the domestic condition; hence the generalized un-beautiful beast was chosen to be man's servant and companion. In the same <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if we were taking to the daw in preference to the more beautiful bird because he is more like us, or understands us better, or adapts himself more readily to our way of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know so {{much about}} that," [...] said George. [...] "The <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to me is that I'm just starting. This eloquence is a thing that rather grows on one. You didn't hear about my after-dinner speech at the anniversary banquet of the firm, I suppose? My dear fellow, a riot! A {{positive}} stampede. Had 'em laughing and then crying and then laughing again and then crying once more till six of 'em had to be led out and the rest down with hiccoughs. Napkins waving ... three tables broken ... waiters in hysterics. I tell you, I played on them as on a stringed instrument...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{this is the}} <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to me," [...] Bill Jepson said slowly, as if {{talking with}} himself, [...] "though, of course, I ain't countin' on interferin' with you lads in any way: What I've got to tell the {{commodore}} is of more importance than the yarn Macomber can spin for the admiral, an' Darius Thorpe seemed to think I couldn't see the old man any too soon. Now if this 'ere sneak is goin' to wait where he is till the fleet comes, what's to prevent our keepin' on as we started, an' then comin' back to pull him in? This wind will set us up the river in great shape, an' within four an' twenty hours we should be at Nottingham, unless the town has been moved from where I saw it last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, den, dis is de <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> to me, Huck. Ef it wuz HIM dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, {{would he}} say, 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?' Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You BET he wouldn't! WELL, den, is JIM gywne to say it? No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a DOCTOR, not if it's forty year!" ...|$|R
50|$|First ropes {{are made}} by the straw. The ropes are {{tightened}} in such a <b>way</b> that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like round shaped and called as a Mora. Lapping one mora above another makes a round shaped vessel.|$|R
50|$|The two {{buildings}} {{faced each other}} until 1971, when 317 Broadway was torn down. Early tenants of 319 Broadway included the Security State Bank and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Corporation. Above the first story, 319 Broadway remains similar to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> {{at the time of}} its construction. The stoop was removed in 1912, along with sidewalk encumbrances. Around that time, the basement level was designated as the first story, which classified the building as a five-story structure. The building continues to house offices and a restaurant.|$|R
