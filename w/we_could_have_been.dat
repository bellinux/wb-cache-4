500|$|At the 1999 Tournament of the Americas, Nash led Canada to {{the silver}} medal, {{qualifying}} {{the team for}} the Olympics {{for the first time}} in 12 years; he was named tournament MVP. Nash captained Canada at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He led Canada to win their round robin group with a victory over Spain and a stunning 83–75 win over favoured Yugoslavia when he scored 26 points with eight rebounds and eight assists. Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinals with a five-point loss to France and Nash left the court in tears. Nash expressed disappointment with the result, saying [...] "It hurts a lot. I feel like I let everybody down. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the championship game. We were good enough." [...] Nevertheless, he did see a possible silver lining, saying [...] "Hopefully kids [...] will be inspired to play—that's what I really hope." [...] A victory in its final game of the tournament, a placement game against Russia, enabled Canada to salvage seventh place. Nash's Olympic performance propelled him to stardom in Canada and he finished fifth in voting for the 2000 Lionel Conacher Award, which is handed out to the Canadian male athlete of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Sympathy for the Devil is {{also the}} title of a producer's edit of a 1968 film by Jean-Luc Godard whose own {{original}} version is called One Plus One. [...] The film, a depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, also featured the Rolling Stones in the process of recording the song in the studio. On the filming, Jagger said in Rolling Stone: [...] " [...] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never happen now, to get someone as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recording 'My Obsession.' But it was 'Sympathy for the Devil', and it became the track that we used." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goozee was {{released}} again in 1993, aged 70, and relocated to Chatham, Kent {{where he was}} provided with sheltered housing. It was here, on 25 December 1995, that Goozee lured two girls aged 12 and 13 into his home where he gave them alcohol and then indecently assaulted them. The attacks came to light after the girls contacted ChildLine, a telephone counselling service for children provided by the NSPCC. Goozee was tried at Maidstone Crown Court in December 1996 where the jury cleared him of the rape {{of one of the}} girls but found him guilty of indecent assault. Mr. Justice Gower sentenced him to 6 years imprisonment and said that Goozee's [...] "horrifying" [...] record should be considered if it was felt he should be released in the future. Predating the newspaper's July 2000 campaign for Sarah's Law, the News of the World highlighted the case as an example of why the government should allow controlled access to the Sex Offenders Register, so parents with young children could know if a sex-offender was living in their area. One of the girls' mothers said: [...] "He was put into the community by the authorities, and none of the parents around here knew that he was a child killer. When I found out what he had done in the past it made me feel physically sick. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> burying our kids instead of just trying to rebuild their lives after an horrific ordeal. I hope he rots." [...] The second mother said: [...] "We should have been told this 'sweet old man' was really a child murderer." ...|$|E

60|$|Then, {{without waiting}} for permission, Darius began giving us fool orders {{intended}} to get the pungy under way, and we came lumbering around under the ship's starboard, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blown into the next world with no more labor than the lighting of a match.|$|E

6000|$|... "No. The least {{grain of}} deceit--of temporising, you call it--spoils everything. It's over," [...] said the girl, rising, with a sigh, {{from the chair}} she had dropped into.

6000|$|... 'Yes, unless I take a {{telescope}} {{to look at}} them with,' answered Elizabeth; 'perhaps, Anne, in thirty years time, if we both live so long, we may meet and talk over this day, and smile, and wonder that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> vexed by anything at such a time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She bowed {{with dignity}} to Lothair, {{and said in}} a low but {{distinct}} voice: [...] "You are most courteous, sir. We have had a sad: accident, but a great escape.

6000|$|... "Brothers always! No, we {{were never}} brothers: we never, never can be brothers," [...] screamed the poor madman through his closed teeth. [...] "Oh! if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> brothers; if--if we could be brothers!" [...] and the long {{cherished}} idea, which, in his frenzy, he even yet had hardly quite abandoned, flashed across his brain, and softened his temper.|$|E
60|$|We {{expected}} {{each moment}} to hear sounds of conflict; {{those who were}} not on duty in the loft remained out of doors watching the soldiers in the distance, and greatly disappointed were we when night came and nothing decisive, so far as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done.|$|R

60|$|Those {{that came}} on shore kept close together, marching towards {{the top of}} the little hill, under which my {{habitation}} lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them; or that they would have gone farther off, that we might have come abroad.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mentioning recollecting,' said Mrs Boffin, {{with her}} work abandoned, her eyes upon the fire, and her chin upon her hand, 'do you recollect, Noddy, how {{you said to}} Mr Rokesmith {{when he first came}} to see us at the Bower, and you engaged him--how you said to him that if it had pleased Heaven to send John Harmon to his fortune safe, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> content with the one Mound which was our legacy, and should never have wanted the rest?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{wind was}} light the whole time, {{and for some}} hours it was nearly calm," [...] {{answered}} Jack, in the same vein; [...] "I kept the schooner's head to the nor'ard, until I thought we were getting too far off our course, and then I put her about. I do not think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> any great distance from the reef, when the boat got away from us, and I suppose we are in its neighbourhood now, for I was tacking to fall in with the boat when the craft went over." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more startled <b>had</b> a frog {{leaped from}} his mouth.

30|$|Another {{approach}} that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> followed <b>was</b> {{the integration of}} some of the existing protocols. However, this approach has two drawbacks: these micropayment protocols do not consider the confidentiality of the payment information exchanged and they use asymmetric cryptography in the payment phase [13 – 16], which is not suitable for real-time transactions due to the computational costs of these operations.|$|R
6000|$|All day Sunday at anchor. The {{storm had}} gone down a great deal, but the sea had not. It was still piling its frothy hills high in air [...] "outside," [...] as we could plainly see with the glasses. We could not {{properly}} begin a pleasure excursion on Sunday; we could not offer untried stomachs to so pitiless a sea as that. We must lie still till Monday. And we did. But we had repetitions of church and prayer-meetings; and so, of course, we were just as eligibly situated as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> any where.|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} people, as I {{observed}} of the other, very inoffensive and sincere; not quarrelsome, nor treacherous, nor mischievous in the least. And we took care {{not so much}} as to let them know the use or manner of our fire-arms for a great while; neither was there one piece fired all the time we were among the other people, where we had so much gold. If there had, it had been very probable that they would have fled the country, {{in spite of all the}} good usage <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to have shown them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> friends,--I mean, if {{it would}} have been good and right for us.

I must part with everything I cared for when I was a child. And I must part with you; we must never take any notice of each other again. That was what I wanted to speak to you for. I {{wanted to let you know}} that Tom and I can't do as we like about such things, and that if I behave as if I had forgotten all about you, it is not out of envy or pride--or--or any bad feeling." ...|$|E

Things went well {{with us for a}} time; we were joined by more men, and were strong enough to divide into two parties, Edgar going to the right while I went to the left. We cleared the wall for some distance, and methinks had there been ladders, so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> helped more quickly, the town would have been won, but the enemy were {{reinforced}} more quickly than we were, and we began to lose ground. Then came a body of knights who beat us back till we were close {{to the point where the}} ladders were set. Then a knight made at me with a mace.

6000|$|When, indignant at the mirth {{excited by}} what had nearly cost us so dear, I {{observed}} that these items had nearly turned the scale against our brother, Griff demanded how <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> such idiots {{as not to}} have written to him; I might at least have had the sense to do so. As to its doing him harm at Hillside, Parson Frank was no fool, and knew what men were made of! Griff would have taken the risk, come at once, and thrust the story down the fellow's throat (as indeed he would have done). The idea of Betsy putting up with a pious young man like Bill, whose only flame had ever been old Miss Newton! And he roared again at the incongruous pair. 'Oh, wasn't she married after all, the hussy?

6000|$|... "From the first, we {{have been}} {{hindered}} by this policy of shilly-shally; this fashion of counseling and counseling and counseling where no counseling is needed, but only fighting. We took Orleans on the 8th of May, and could have cleared the region round about in three days and saved the slaughter of Patay. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in Rheims six weeks ago, and in Paris now; and would see the last Englishman pass out of France in half a year. But we struck no blow after Orleans, but went off into the country--what for? Ostensibly to hold councils; really to give Bedford time to send reinforcements to Talbot--which he did; and Patay had to be fought. After Patay, more counseling, more waste of precious time. Oh, my King, I would {{that you would be}} persuaded!" [...] She began to warm up, now. [...] "Once more we have our opportunity. If we rise and strike, all is well. Bid me march upon Paris. In twenty days it shall be yours, and in six months all France! Here is half a year's work before us; if this chance be wasted, I give you twenty years to do it in.

5000|$|Knebworth was useless. It {{was no good}} at all. It was no {{good because}} we weren't ready to do it, {{the whole thing was}} a {{management}} decision.
