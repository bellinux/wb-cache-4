He served with the First Regiment of Dragoons in the Kansas Territory during its violent abolitionist clashes. On March 3, 1855, he was promoted to major and exchanged positions with another officer to return to his old unit, the Second Dragoons. On October 27, 1855, the regiment marched to Texas, under the command of Albert Sidney Johnson.|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million virus particles can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the <b>war</b> <b>may</b> also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|May {{was born}} in Washington, D.C. on August 9, 1818, {{the son of a}} doctor in a {{prominent}} Baltimore family. He received a civil education, but applied for a commission directly to President Andrew Jackson, who was impressed by his soldierly appearance, bearing, and skill at horsemanship. In 1836, he entered the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the Second Regiment of Dragoons. During the Second Seminole <b>War,</b> <b>May</b> was responsible for the capture of King Philip (Ee-mat-la), the Seminole nation's principal chieftain. He was promoted from first lieutenant to captain on February 2, 1841.|$|E

5|$|The 4th and 55th Fighter Regiments {{had most}} of the MiG-3s {{assigned}} to the Odessa Military District and their experiences {{on the first day}} of the <b>war</b> <b>may</b> be taken as typical. The 4th, an experienced unit, shot down a Romanian Bristol Blenheim reconnaissance bomber, confirmed by postwar research, and lost one aircraft which crashed into an obstacle on takeoff. The 55th was much less experienced with the MiG-3 and claimed three aircraft shot down, although recent research confirms only one German Henschel Hs 126 was 40% damaged, and suffered three pilots killed and nine aircraft lost. The most unusual case was the pair of MiG-3s dispatched from the 55th on a reconnaissance mission to Ploieşti that failed to properly calculate their fuel consumption and both were forced to land when they ran out of fuel.|$|E

40|$|We reevaluate the {{hypothesis}} and empirical result that ethnic civil wars {{lead to higher}} skilled emigration (Bang and Mitra, 2013). We develop a simple conceptual framework that predicts contrasting results depending upon if the economy {{is assumed to be}} agglomerating in skilled labor or non-agglomerating with network effects. In the latter case, non-ethnic <b>wars</b> <b>may</b> lead to higher skilled emigration. A regression model that accounts for the time-varying definition of migration and includes important explanatory variables shows that non-ethnic wars as opposed to ethnic <b>wars</b> <b>may</b> lead to more skilled emigration...|$|R

30|$|The {{relationship}} between conflict and ethnicity is itself not obvious. As Fearon and Laitin (1996) note, most inter-ethnic interactions are peaceful. Yet, a recent {{body of evidence}} suggests that civil <b>wars</b> <b>may</b> well be more likely in heterogeneous settings. Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) and Esteban et al. (2012) found that countries characterized by linguistic polarization {{are more prone to}} civil wars whereas Wimmer et al. (2009) found that participation in civil wars was more likely in countries linguistically fragmented.

25|$|According to Asko Parpola, the <b>war</b> <b>may</b> {{have taken}} place during the later phase of the Painted Grey Ware, circa 75-350 BCE.

25|$|Cities play {{a crucial}} {{strategic}} role in warfare due to their economic, demographic, symbolic, and political centrality. For the same reasons, they are targets in asymmetric warfare. Many cities throughout history were founded under military auspices, a great many have incorporated fortifications, and military principles continue to influence urban design. Indeed, <b>war</b> <b>may</b> have served as the social rationale and economic basis for the very earliest cities.|$|E
25|$|When the University of Michigan and Ohio State met for {{the first}} time in 1897, the Toledo War was within the {{memories}} of some still living, and the short-lived border <b>war</b> <b>may</b> have fueled the rivalry between the two opposing teams. The inaugural game, held at Ann Arbor, resulted in a lopsided victory for Michigan, with the Wolverines posting a 34–0 win over Ohio State's Buckeyes. The teams did not meet in 1898 or 1899, but played again in 1900.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{deployment}} around Santiago has likewise been sternly criticized. Observers faulted Linares {{for failing}} to challenge the American disembarkation at Siboney altogether and Rubín for yielding the ridges at Las Guasimas—despite orders to this effect—to an American column that had failed to eject him. One historian suggested the Spaniards could not oppose the American advance without exposing themselves to a potentially devastating bombardment from long-range naval guns.

25|$|Since the {{conflict}} {{took place at}} a very early point in Greek history, before historiography had developed, there are no contemporaneous written sources on the events. The few later sources and the much more copious archaeological evidence allow for a sketchy picture of the Lelantine War. However, {{as a result of the}} ambiguity of the surviving written sources, date and extent of the war are disputed among Classical scholarship.

25|$|While he was {{campaigning for}} president, {{the story of}} how Lincoln stopped his men from killing the Potawatomi they {{encountered}} before the outbreak of the war made its way into a campaign biography. Reporting by The New York Times during the campaign of 1860 noted Lincoln's war time service as a captain. The same article implies that his bravery during the Black Hawk <b>War</b> <b>may</b> have led to his post-war appointment as postmaster in New Salem. Following Lincoln's assassination, Ralph Waldo Emerson gave a speech in Concord, Massachusetts, which highlighted Lincoln's Black Hawk War service.|$|E
25|$|The war caused serious dislocations to {{both the}} economies and populations of central Europe, but may have done no more than seriously {{exacerbate}} changes that had begun earlier. Also, some historians contend that the human cost of the <b>war</b> <b>may</b> actually have improved the living standards of the survivors. According to Ulrich Pfister, Germany {{was one of the}} richest countries in Europe per capita in 1500, but ranked far lower in 1600. Then, it recovered during the 1600–1660 period, in part thanks to the demographic shock of the Thirty Years' War.|$|E
