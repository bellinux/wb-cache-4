5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E
5|$|Tittle {{was then}} {{drafted by the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1951 NFL Draft after the Colts folded. While many players {{at the time were}} unable to play {{immediately}} due to military duties, Tittle had received a class IV-F exemption due to physical ailments, so he was able to join the 49ers roster that season. In 1951 and 1952, he shared time at quarterback with Frankie Albert. In 1953, his first full season as the 49ers' starter, he passed for 2,121 yards and twenty touchdowns and was invited to his first Pro Bowl. San Francisco finished with a 9–3 regular season record, which <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> second in the Western Conference, and led the league in points scored.|$|E
5|$|Under the 2006 pyramid reorganisations, a third-place {{finish in}} the Wessex League <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> {{promotion}} back to the Southern League, along with local rivals Winchester City and Thatcham Town. In their first season back, they finished in ninth place, just five points from the divisional playoffs. They were unable to build on this and struggled to a nineteenth-place {{finish in the}} following season, ultimately finishing 29points above relegation after Slough Town were reprieved following Halifax Town's expulsion from the Football Conference. Andover's home match against Uxbridge, played {{towards the end of}} that season, was the club's thousandth game in the Southern League.|$|E

5|$|The next year, Taylor pitched for the Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees, {{where the}} Yankees {{planned to have}} Taylor work on his curveball, as they already felt that his fastball <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the major leagues. Entering the season, he was named baseball's second-best {{prospect}} behind Chipper Jones. That year, Taylor had a 137 record, a 3.48 ERA, and 150 strikeouts in 163 innings, and also led the Eastern League with 102 walks. In 1994, {{he was expected to}} pitch for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League, and start for the Yankees to begin the 1995 season at the latest, dependent on how he would have performed in spring training. After the season ended, the Yankees wanted Taylor to take part in an instructional league to work on his fundamentals. Taylor declined to attend the camp, and instead chose to return to his home in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Péraud's time {{remained}} untouched {{until the}} final group of riders set off, and with 's Simon Špilak coming closest to Péraud {{in a time of}} 19' 59", having faded from a similar time at the intermediate point of the Col des Quatre Chemins, the stage battle ultimately came down to the two riders in contention for the overall honours; Wiggins and 's Lieuwe Westra. Westra set off two minutes before Wiggins, and although noted as proficient in the time trial discipline, he left everything on the hill as he set the fastest time to the intermediate checkpoint; recording a time of 11' 29", taking around three seconds per kilometre out of Péraud's time of 11' 47". Two minutes later, Wiggins passed the same point two seconds slower than Westra, but a stronger second half to the stage sealed the victory for Wiggins; as the hill flattened, Wiggins' time-trial experience proved pivotal as he overhauled the deficit to Westra, and finished the stage with a two-second advantage over Westra, taking the stage win, overall victory and the points classification in one fell swoop. 's Alejandro Valverde, who had held the lead of the points classification prior to the stage, could only muster sixth on the stage, but this result <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him to claim the final remaining place on the podium.|$|E
5|$|The WAC preseason polls were {{released}} on October 29, and Louisiana Tech was predicted to finish {{sixth in the}} media poll and fifth in the coaches poll. Fellow senior Gibson {{was named to the}} preseason All-WAC second team, but Rolle was not honored by any preseason award. In the Bulldogs' home opener against Arkansas-Little Rock, Rolle was the leader in scoring with 23 points in crushing the Trojans 86–66. Gibson and Olu Ashaolu also scored more than 20 points to push Louisiana Tech to a 4–1 start, their best since 2001. Rolle's career high in points was 29, scored against Houston in a 99–94 defeat of the Cougars on December 29; Rolle also grabbed 10 boards. In the semifinal of the WAC tournament, against the #1 seeded Utah State Aggies, Rolle injured his ankle less than three minutes into the game, a factor in the Bulldogs' 30-point loss. They finished the regular season 23–10, including a 9–7 record in conference. That <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> an invitation to the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT), in which Louisiana Tech defeated Southern Miss in the first round despite missing Rolle. In Rolle's final collegiate game, he contributed nine points off the bench despite a 69–40 rout of the Bulldogs by Missouri State in the CIT's quarterfinals.|$|E

She had a below par performance at the 2009 South American Championships in Athletics, throwing 63.81m for the bronze medal. Despite this, she was also the best South American performer in the hammer at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, where her throw of 68.90m <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> 17th, but not enough to make the final round.|$|E
25|$|Surrey did {{not play}} at the Oval in 1854 {{as a result of}} a dispute with the lease. To {{supplement}} his income, Caesar was employed by one of the Marshalls at the new Cricketers' pub in Nightingale Road, Farncombe. 1854 was as strong a year for Caesar as 1853, with him averaging a very respectable 22.30 in first-class cricket. This <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him to be selected for the Players (professionals) against the Gentlemen (amateurs) at Lord's.

25|$|The Athletics {{began the}} 1969 season under the {{leadership}} of Hank Bauer. On July 20, 1969, future ace Vida Blue made his major league debut. The Athletics' on-field performance continued to improve; led by Reggie Jackson's 47 home runs, the A's finished the season with a record of 88-74. This <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> second place (behind the Minnesota Twins) in the newly created American League West division. This improvement, though, was not enough for Finley; Hank Bauer was fired (and replaced with John McNamara) {{near the end of the}} season. The team's record stood at 80-69 at the time of his firing. McNamara himself would be fired following an 89-73 finish in 1970. He was replaced by former Boston Red Sox manager Dick Williams.|$|E
25|$|Parcells again orchestrated a {{remarkable}} turnaround {{in his first}} year with the Jets. In his first season with the Jets, the team barely missed the playoffs with a record of 9–7 (the Jets were 1-15 the year before Parcells arrived, and had won a total of 10 games in the previous three seasons combined). In 1998, the Jets went to the playoffs with a current franchise-best 12–4 record, which <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> second place in the conference and earned the Jets their third home playoff game since moving to New Jersey in 1984 (their first home playoff game was against the New England Patriots following the 1985 season), but lost to the eventual Super Bowl-champion Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game.|$|E
25|$|Just {{when things}} couldn't {{seem to get}} any worse coming off a last place overall finish, they did for the 1983–84 season, as the Cents {{finished}} with an abysmal record of 8–51–1.

This {{despite the fact that}} forward Brent Demerais set a single season team record that still stands today with 66 goals. His total represents 26.7% of the total goals the team scored that season. In fact, Demerais' point total of 124 <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> third overall in the BCJHL, but it was the lone bright spot in a season with very few.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year saw {{the publication of}} one of his finest novellas, First Love ("Первая любовь"), which was based on bitter-sweet childhood memories, and the delivery of his speech ("Hamlet and Don Quixote", at a public reading in Saint Petersburg) in aid of writers and scholars suffering hardship. The vision presented therein of man torn between the self-centered skepticism of Hamlet and the idealistic generosity of Don Quixote is one that can be said to pervade Turgenev's own works. It is worth noting that Dostoyevsky, who had just returned from exile in Siberia, was present at this speech, for eight years later he was to write The Idiot, a novel whose tragic hero, Prince Myshkin, resembles Don Quixote in many respects. Turgenev, whose knowledge of Spanish, thanks to his contact with Pauline Viardot and her family, <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him to have considered translating Cervantes's novel into Russian, {{played an important role in}} introducing this immortal figure of world literature into the Russian context.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event of the show, Dr. Wagner Jr. faced TNA worker Rob Van Dam to {{determine}} the first ever AAA Latin American Champion. Wagner, like L.A.

Van Dam used a steel chair on several occasions in the match, including kicking it in Wagner's face from the top rope. Eventually Wagner started a comeback with a top rope head-and-arm suplex suplex, before signaling for his finishing maneuver, the Wagner Driver. Wagner managed to hit the move, but Van Dam {{kicked out of the}} following pinfall. Wagner followed up with a rope hung DDT onto a steel chair, which <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a three count.

25|$|A {{roller coaster}} decade {{continued}} for the franchise as the 1987–88 season {{began with the}} team changing its name back to the Centennials.

The point total of 50 <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> fourth in the Interior Division, just eight points behind the second place Kelowna Packers. Frank Biller, Al Rushton, and Cal McGowan led the team offensively. Biller posted 57 goals and 49 assists for 106 points, sixth overall in the BCJHL. Rushton chipped in with 87 points and McGowan ended up with 79 points, both good enough to be amongst the top eight scorers in the Interior Division.
