The component socket accepts a <b>wire</b> <b>lead,</b> such as the lead of a resistor or capacitor, or the leg of a 0.1-inch-pitch DIL package. The insulation-displacement fork accepts an insulated wire specially manufactured for the Speedwire system. The wire is pressed between the forks using a special tool. The forks cut through the insulation and grip the wire, making a gas-tight contact. The wire can then be cut off, or continued to another terminal. Wires can be pulled out of terminals and re-routed.|$|E

This was connected by using a clip with an attached <b>wire</b> <b>lead.</b> An example would be the 6A7 pentagrid converter. Later, some tubes, particularly those used as radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers or horizontal deflection amplifiers in TV sets, such as the 6DQ6, had the plate or anode lead protrude through the envelope. In both cases this allowed the tube's output circuitry to be isolated from the input (grid) circuit more effectively. In the case of the tubes with the plate brought out to a cap, this also allowed the plate to run at higher voltages (over 26,000 volts in the case of rectifiers for color television, such as the 3A3, as well as high-voltage regulator tubes.) A few unusual tubes had caps for both grid and plate; the caps were symmetrically placed, with divergent axes.|$|E

In particular, it would be useful to know if these structures retain any of the Luttinger liquid properties that are predicted for a pure one-dimensional metal. However, experimental studies of such structures have so far yielded unclear and contradictory results. We investigate this problem theoretically by creating a highly simplified model of a wire on a surface [...] a chain of atoms that includes electron-electron interactions to represent the wire, coupled to a similar chain that excludes electron-electron interactions to represent, albeit crudely, the surface. We present results for the eigenstates and spectral functions for such systems that suggest that many Luttinger liquid indicators are present. However the system as a whole retains some residual Fermi liquid characteristics, and therefore merges properties of both one and higher dimensions...|$|E

During the monthly surveillance test STP 0125. 002 A on 12 / 21 / 00, the "A " diesel generator experienced load swings during unloading. Replacement of the Woodward Governor EGA unit eliminated the load swing problem. Following removal of the EGA unit, an on-site bench test and inspection was performed. Although the EGA successfully passed the bench test, the inspection identified some questionable solder joints on the stability potentiometer (pot). This pot has three ring terminal connections through which wire leads are looped and then soldered. One of the connections had the <b>wire</b> <b>lead</b> looped through it, but did not appear to have any solder on it. It was suspected that if contact between the lead and terminal were intermittent on the stability pot, then the output signal from the EGA would be erratic and cause load swings and instability, as was experienced on 12 / 21 / 00. Since all of the pots in an EGA were replaced during refurbishment by Power Control Services (PCS) of Engine Systems, Inc. (a Woodward governor nuclear supplier), adequate soldering of the pot terminals during a previous refurbishment was questioned. The EGA was sent to PCS for inspection, testing and refurbishment to determine if it caused the problems experienced during the surveillance testing. ~j 3 ~gj/c 7...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, basic {{research}} focused on quantum systems relevant {{for the future}} nanotechnologies is presented. The research is modeling based on electronic structure calculations using the density-functional theory. For {{the solution of the}} ensuing Kohn-Sham equations, we have developed a new numerical scheme based on the Rayleigh quotient multigrid method. While {{an important part of the}} thesis is formed by software development for three-dimensional first-principles real-space electronic structure calculations, we use axially symmetric model systems in the study of nanostructures. This approximation reduces the computational demands and allows studies of rather large nanoscale systems encompassing hundreds or thousands of electrons. In addition, by restricting the geometry to the axial symmetry and resorting to jellium models, many random effects related to the detailed ionic structure are absent, and the relevant physics is easier to extract from the simulations. Nanowires can be considered as the ultimate conductors in which the atomistic confinement of electrons perpendicular to the wire and the atomistic length of the <b>wire</b> <b>lead</b> to quantum mechanical effects in cohesive and transport properties. The breaking process of a nanowire is studied using the ultimate jellium model, in which the positive background charge compensates in every point the electronic charge. Thereby, the shape of the narrowing constriction is free to vary so that the total energy is minimized. The prospect of molecular electronics is to use single molecules as circuit components. The electronic transport in atomic chains of a few Na atoms between cone-shaped leads is investigated in the thesis. Electrons residing in a Na island on the Cu(111) surface form a quantum dot system, in which the quantum mechanical confinement in all directions determines the electronic properties. We have developed a simple jellium model system which reproduces the characteristics of the confined electron states seen in scanning tunneling microscope experiments. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{nuclear power}} {{engineering}} {{a need to}} justify an operability of products and their components is of great importance. In high-temperature gas reactors, the critical element affecting the facility reliability is the fuel rod cladding, which in turn leads {{to the need to}} gain knowledge in the field of gas dynamics and heat transfer in the reactor core and to increase the detail of the calculation results. For the time being, calculations of reactor core are performed using the proven techniques of per-channel calculations, which show good representativeness and count rate. However, these techniques require additional experimental studies to describe correctly the inter-channel exchange, which, being taken into account, largely affects the pattern of the temperature fields in the region under consideration. Increasingly more relevant and demandable are numerical simulation methods of fluid and gas dynamics, as well as of heat exchange, which consist in the direct solution of the system of differential equations of mass balance, kinetic moment, and energy. Calculation of reactor cores or rod bundles according these techniques does not require additional experimental studies and allows us to obtain the local distributions of flow characteristics in the bundle and the flow characteristics that are hard to measure in the physical experiment. The article shows the calculation results and their analysis for an infinite rod lattice of the reactor core. The results were obtained by the technique of modelling one rod of a regular lattice using the periodic boundary conditions, followed by translating the results to the neighbouring rods. In channels of complex shape, there are secondary flows caused by changes in the channel geometry along the flow and directed across the main front of the flow. These secondary flows in the reactor cores with rods spaced by the winding <b>wire</b> <b>lead</b> to a redistribution of the coolant along the channel section, which in turn results in a heat flow from the more heated rods to the less heated ones. The largest vector values of the transversal velocity are observed near the rod surface immediately behind the fin that passes in the section under consideration. These features lead to the exchange of mass and heat between the conjugate cells of the bundle of rods. The distribution of the transversal velocity in the gap between the rods has a periodic saw-tooth pattern, which can be justified {{by the fact that the}} fins pass periodically through the gap. Thus, the maximum of the flow is achieved immediately after passing the fins through the gap when the maximum transverse velocities can be observed directly behind the fins, and the minimum occurs when the fins move to meet each other, and before the fins in the gap is formed a region with the minimum values of the transversal velocity. </p...|$|E

40|$|For {{calculations}} and measurements of transient characteristics of groundings, {{the current and}} potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> are frequently used accordingly to inject the current into the grounding and find the grounding potential rise (GPR). The results of the {{calculations and}} measurements can be dependent on {{the location of the}} current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> due to mutual influence between them and the grounding wire. It is important to determine to what extent the location of the wires influences the calculation results for the grounding with a simple configuration. Notably, in contrast to the measurements, for the calculations it is possible to locate wires vertically, also the potential <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> can be replaced by the integral of the electric field. For the calculations the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been used in the work. In order to estimate to what extent the calculated GPR can be influenced by location of the wires, calculations with different wires locations have been carried out. An analysis of the calculation results has been made. There are calculation methods in which the injection of the current and calculation of the GPR are performed without the current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires.</b> The method based on the telegrapher's equations is one of such methods. In order to determine what location of the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> gives the same calculation results as those of the method that uses the telegrapher's equations, a comparison of calculation results of two methods has been made.

Location of one of the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> above the grounding wire significantly reduces the calculated GPR.
