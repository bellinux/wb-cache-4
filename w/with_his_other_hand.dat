25|$|Shepherd {{was convicted}} of the crime on October 9, 2008, after jurors deliberated for four hours. He was given the maximum {{sentence}} of 99 {{years in prison and}} a $10,000 fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, Shepherd revealed how he murdered Stewart. He pressured her to reveal her new relationship at college, but she refused to answer and grabbed a knife from a table and approached him with it in her hand. She swung at him with the knife and nicked his fingers. Afraid she was going to stab him again, he grabbed her around the neck with one arm and tried to reach the knife <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> He ended up choking her to death out of anger. He later went to the hardware store to purchase a jigsaw. He undressed the body and dismembered it in his bathtub using the jigsaw and other tools. He barbecued the remains on his grills in his patio.|$|E

[...] "He sat down on my bed and, not noticing, put his hat down {{on a sheet of}} sticky flypaper I had placed there. To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> and soon he was tangled up gloriously. Before I could come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The crotch chop and {{the words}} [...] "suck it" [...] {{actually}} originated with the nWo, while Syxx/X-Pac was still {{a member of the}} faction, Later on DX would use a cross armed x-chop. The signature DX slogan originated on the October 6, 1997 episode of Raw Is War, with Shawn Michaels stating, [...] "I've got two words for 'The Hitman' Bret Hart: suck it!", before doing a one-armed crotch-chop (while holding the microphone <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand).</b> Later in the episode, both Michaels and Triple H (separately) proceeded to the ring for the Bret Hart-Triple H match, each of them directing the slogan and crotch-chops at fans seated along the entry ramp.|$|E

50|$|The actual deal (distribution of cards) {{is done in}} the {{direction}} of play, beginning with eldest hand. The dealer holds the pack, face down, in one hand, and removes cards from the top of it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> to distribute to the players, placing them face down {{on the table in front}} of the players to whom they are dealt. The cards may be dealt one at a time, or in batches of more than one card; and either the entire pack or a determined number of cards are dealt out. The undealt cards, if any, are left face down in the middle of the table, forming the stock (also called the talon, widow, skat or kitty depending on the game and region).|$|R

In 1924 he moved to Tel Aviv, where he became a celebrated literary figure and ultimately came to be recognized as Israel's national poet. The Hebrew and Yiddish poet, writer, essayist, literary critic, and journalist, David Frischmann (born 1859 in Zgierz, now Poland; died 1922 in Berlin) was one of modern Jewry's first major writers. The prominent Moscow artist Leonid Osipovich Pasternak (1862 - 1945) was born in Odessa. He emigrated to Berlin in 1921, the same year as the Hebrew poet Bialik. Updated record. Digital imag...|$|R
40|$|Suprascapular nerve (SSN) {{entrapment}} at the {{suprascapular notch}} is an uncommon cause of shoulder pathology that often presents with posterior shoulder pain and wasting of the supraspinatus (SS) and infraspinatus (IS) muscles. 11 Because of the rarity of this condition, its diagnosis can be missed {{for months or}} years; therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment is crucial to prevent muscle wasting and atrophy. 11, 17 The anatomy makes it susceptible to static and dynamic compression, yet the vague symptoms accompanying this disorder often {{make it difficult to}} correctly diagnose. 12 Patients with suprascapular neuropathy often describe dull aching pain 3 to 4 cm medial to the posterolateral corner of the spine of the scapula. 12 The Suprascapular Nerve Stretch Test can help guide the physical examination when assessing SSN entrapment (Figure 1). 11 This test reproduces posterior shoulder pain by laterally rotating the patient’s head away from the involved shoulder while the clinician depresses/ retracts the involved shoulder <b>with</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> 1...|$|R
5000|$|Since Earl Hines took {{it up in}} 1928, other jazz pianists have {{occasionally}} {{used the}} celesta as an alternative instrument. In the 1930s, Fats Waller sometimes played celesta <b>with</b> <b>his</b> right hand and piano simultaneously <b>with</b> <b>his</b> left <b>hand.</b> <b>Other</b> notable jazz pianists who occasionally played the celesta include Memphis Slim, Meade [...] "Lux" [...] Lewis, Willie [...] "The Lion" [...] Smith, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Buddy Greco, Oscar Peterson, McCoy Tyner, Sun Ra, Keith Jarrett, and Herbie Hancock. A celesta provides the introduction to Someday You'll Be Sorry, a song Louis Armstrong recorded for RCA, and is featured prominently throughout the piece. A number of recordings Frank Sinatra made for Columbia in the 1940s feature the instrument (namely I'll Never Smile Again), as do many of his albums recorded for Capitol in the 1950s (In the Wee Small Hours, Close to You and Songs for Swingin' Lovers). The instrument is used prominently {{in the introduction to}} the 1928 recording by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five of [...] "Basin Street Blues".|$|R

500|$|In {{the lower}} {{center of the}} painting, Matejko shows a scene {{that took place in}} the Royal Castle. Jan Suchorzewski (8), deputy from Kalisz and an {{opponent}} of the Constitution, has fallen to the ground, holding <b>his</b> young son <b>with</b> one arm; <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> holding a knife, is held by Stanisław Kublicki (9), standing to his right. Kublicki was a deputy from Inflanty, a supporter of the townsfolk and peasant causes, and of the Constitution. The artist here alludes to Suchorzewski's unsuccessful attempt to prevent the king from signing the Constitution, during which he threatening to kill his own son to save him from the [...] "slavery of the Constitution". A deck of cards has fallen out of Suchorzewski's pocket, a reference to the manner in which he was bribed by the anti-Constitution Russian ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg and hetman Branicki; Suchorzewski suddenly started winning large sums of money in games, despite his poor skills as a gambler. Branicki (10) can be seen standing between the king and Suchorzewski, dressed in a Russian uniform, foreshadowing the rank of general he received several years later in the Russian Army. In reality Suchorzewski, like most of those opposed to the Constitution, refused to participate in the procession.|$|R
50|$|In tennis, {{a player}} {{may be able}} to reach balls on the backhand side more easily if they're able to use the weaker hand. An example of a player who is ambidextrous is Luke Jensen. Rafael Nadal uses his right hand for writing, but plays tennis with left. There are many players who are {{naturally}} right handed but play lefty and vice versa. Evgenia Kulikovskaya is also an ambidextrous player, Kulikovskaya played with two forehands and no backhand, switching her racket hand depending on where the ball was coming. Jan-Michael Gambill is the opposite case of Kulikovskaya, since he played with a two handed forehand and backhand, although he served <b>with</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand.</b> <b>Other</b> famous examples of a two handed forehand are Fabrice Santoro and Monica Seles. Seles' playing style was unusual in that she hit with two hands on both sides and, at the same time, always kept her (dominant) left hand at the base of her racket. This meant that she hit her forehand cross-handed. Currently, Maria Sharapova is also known to be ambidextrous.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps few {{persons who}} are {{accustomed}} to weigh and test evidence, who know the weaknesses of human memories, and the illusions which impose themselves upon our recollections, will lay great stress on the discrepancies between Henderson’s first deposition (in August), his second (in November), and the statement of the King. In the footnote printed below, {69a} Hudson explains the origin of certain differences between the King’s narrative and Henderson’s evidence, given in August. Hudson declares that James boasted of having taken the dagger out of Ruthven’s hands (which, in fact, James does not do, in his published narration), and that Henderson claimed to have snatched the dagger away, ‘to move mercy by more merit.’ It is clear that James would not accept his story of disarming Ruthven; Henderson omits that in his second deposition. For the rest, James, who was quite clever enough to discover the discrepancies, let them stand, {{at the end of}} his own printed narrative, with the calm remark, that if any differences existed in the depositions, they must be taken as ‘uttered by the deponer in his own behouf, for obtaining of his Majesty’s princely grace and favour.’ {69b} Henderson’s first deposition was one of these which James printed <b>with</b> <b>his</b> own narrative, and thus treated en prince. He was not going to harmonise <b>his</b> evidence <b>with</b> Henderson’s, or Henderson’s <b>with</b> <b>his.</b> On the <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> from the first, Henderson had probably the opportunity to frame his confession on the Falkland letter of August 5 to the Chancellor, and the Provost of Edinburgh; and, later, on the printed narrative officially issued at the close of August 1600. He varied, when he did vary, in hopes of ‘his Majesty’s princely grace and favour,’ and he naturally tried to make out that he was not a mere trembling expostulating caitiff. He clung to the incident of the garter which he snatched from the Master’s hand.|$|R
60|$|A wild impulse {{of revenge}} {{came over the}} savage. He caught her by the neck <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> pressed her throat hard, till she was black in the face, kicked her several times with ferocious rage, and then flung her away from him {{to the other side}} of the hut with a fierce and untranslatable native imprecation.|$|E
60|$|I {{should not}} like to have Mr. Pike for my surgeon. He probed for the bullet with his little finger, which was far {{too big for the}} aperture; and with his little finger, while <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> he {{threatened}} another ear-clout, he gouged out the leaden pellet. Then he sent the boy below, where Margaret took him in charge with antiseptics and dressings.|$|E

60|$|The {{next thing}} that came through the rent was a long pitchfork, which they darted {{at me from the}} outside, to move me from the door.

Before he could catch at the fork <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> I had drawn it inside. By this time even Jerry lost his temper and swore more awfully than Dick himself.|$|E
60|$|Starling, {{if indeed}} he were there, seemed {{now to be}} even holding his breath. Arnold took one step back and charged the door.

The closet--it was little more--was filled with smoke, and Arnold heard distinctly the hiss of a bullet buried in the woodwork over his shoulder.
