5|$|In late 1989, Federal Airports Corporation Inspector A. Rohead was put {{in charge}} of a bicentennial project to rename streets in Melbourne Airport to honour the {{original}} inhabitants, European pioneers and aviation history. Information on the first two categories was provided by Ian Hunter, Wurundjeri researcher, and Ray Gibb, local historian. The project was completed but was shelved, with the only suggested name, Gowrie Park Drive, being allocated, named after the farm {{at the heart of the}} airport. During the 1920s, the farm had been used as a landing site for aircraft, which <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> at night during World War II in case Essendon Aerodrome was bombed.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, {{reinforcements}} {{had reached}} {{them and the}} decision was made to move the commandos to La Calle by rail. With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the train driver jumped from the engine, one of the commandos took over the duties of driving the train. The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a reconnaissance patrol near Tabarka, to determine whether the German tanks that <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> there were real or decoys.|$|E

5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars <b>were</b> <b>parked,</b> 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, T-26s served {{mainly in}} {{separate}} light tank brigades (each brigade had 256–267 T-26s) and in separate tank battalions of rifle divisions (one company of T-26s consisted of 10–15 tanks). These were the type of tank units that participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 and in the Winter War from December 1939 – March 1940. The Winter War proved that the T-26 was obsolete and its design reserve was totally depleted. Finnish 37mm antitank guns and even 20mm antitank rifles easily penetrated the T-26's thin anti-bullet armour and tank units equipped with the T-26 suffered significant losses during the breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line, in which the flame-throwing tanks based on the T-26 chassis played a significant role.By mid-1941, most of the Red Army's vast numbers of tanks were suffering from serious wear and tear. Poor quality roads, the vulnerabilities of track design in the early 1930s and inadequate maintenance, recovery and repair services all took their toll. In some of the front line armoured units, {{up to half of}} the T-26, T-28 and BT tanks had major drive train components (engine, drive train or suspension) that were broken down or worn out and these disabled tanks <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> and cannibalised for spare parts to keep the rest running. Tanks damaged during the 1939 Winter War with Finland were also cannibalised for parts.|$|E

5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the one and}} a {{half months}} after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, {{underwent}} tests in preparations for the first flight. Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two semi-trailers <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> parallel to each other outside Building 82; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but Have Blue retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12–13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, Have Blues chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design's characteristic faceting. The aircraft was disassembled and loaded onto a C-5– on 16November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed Bob Hope Airport) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight. After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.|$|E

25|$|World War II {{affected}} Southampton {{much more}} than World War One. Again women were employed, but this time {{they were allowed to}} drive the trams too. Car no.31 was destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 30 November 1940, the only loss of the war. To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II, they were painted grey, regular services ceased at 7pm and they <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common.|$|E

Gen. Charles S. Winder's division on the north bank of North River near the bridge. The 15th Alabama Infantry regiment was left to block the roads at Union Church. Jackson's headquarters were in Madison Hall at Port Republic. The army trains <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> nearby.|$|E
25|$|All {{traffic from}} Gran Canaria, {{including}} five large airliners, had been diverted to Los Rodeos, a regional airport {{that could not}} easily accommodate them. The airport had only one runway and one major taxiway parallel to it, with four short taxiways connecting the two. While waiting for Gran Canaria airport to reopen, the diverted aircraft took up so much space that they <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> on the long taxiway, meaning {{that it could not}} be used for taxiing. Instead, departing aircraft had to taxi along the runway to position themselves for takeoff, a procedure known as a backtaxi or backtrack.|$|E
25|$|An {{accident}} {{affecting the}} particular Trident operating as BE 548 had occurred on 3 July 1968. Due to a control failure, an Airspeed Ambassador freight aircraft, G-AMAD, deviated from the runway on landing at Heathrow and struck G-ARPI and its neighbouring sister aircraft, G-ARPT, while they <b>were</b> <b>parked</b> unoccupied near Terminal 1, resulting in six fatalities from the freighter's eight occupants. G-ARPT {{was cut in}} two and was damaged beyond economic repair; G-ARPI lost its tail fin, which was repaired {{at a cost of}} £750,000. G-ARPI performed satisfactorily thereafter; the incident is thought to have had no bearing on its subsequent crash.|$|E
