25|$|In the Letter, Rousseau {{rejected}} the traditional notion of male politicians {{being responsible for}} moral reform, {{and thought it was}} women's responsibility. He considered women, by virtue of their nature, to be the primary agents of moral reform, and that the success of the state depends on the harmony within private, domestic life. Rousseau opposed marriage without love (i.e. marriage for financial reasons, order, lust, convenience). In Rousseau's opinion, true love for the nurturing, feminine mother, instead of lustful love for a mistress, {{goes hand in hand with}} patriotism and civic harmony. The legislator's task is to make sure a society's <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> order.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} of the Prophet Muḥammad in female education was manifest {{in the fact that}} he himself used to teach women along with men. Muḥammad's teachings were widely sought by both sexes, and accordingly {{at the time of his}} death it was reported that there were many female scholars of Islam. Additionally, the wives of the Prophet Muḥammadparticularly Aishaalso taught both women and men; many of Muḥammad's companions and followers learned the Qur'an, ḥadīth and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) from Aisha. Notably, there was no restriction placed on the type of knowledge acquired: a woman was free to choose any field of knowledge that interested her. Because Islam recognises that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> principle wives and mothers, the acquisition of knowledge in fields which are complementary to these social roles was specially emphasised.|$|E
25|$|No women {{occupy the}} top {{leadership}} {{positions in the}} most profitable Iranian businesses either. Iran's three largest companies-National Iranian Oil Company (the second largest in the Muslim World), Iran Khodro, and National Petrochemical Company-also {{do not have any}} women in senior leadership positions. This is not surprising as the 2006 Iranian census showed that only 4% of <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> senior executive or management positions. Critics of Iran's radical shia theocratic government may attribute this evidence of limited female economic mobility as a critique of the government's ideology. However, in Turkey, which is a secular state governed by a moderate Islamic party, women comprised only 8% of managers in the labor force in 2007. Regardless of the official status of Islam or the ideology of the ruling party, there exists some evidence of a glass ceiling for women in the private sector.|$|E

However, both French quotations in History of a Six Weeks' Tour undercut this Romantic image. The first describes the overturning of a boat and the drowning of its occupants; the second is a warning not to travel on foot through France, as Napoleon's army has just been disbanded and the <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> danger of rape.|$|E

2500|$|Sex ratio {{theory is}} a theory that {{explains}} the relationship and sexual dynamics within {{different areas of the}} world based on the ratio of the number of marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women. According to this theory, an area has a high sex ratio when there is a higher number of marriage-aged women to marriage-aged men and an area has a low sex ratio when there is more marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women. In terms of infidelity, the theory states that when sex-ratios are high, men {{are more likely to be}} promiscuous and engage in sex outside of a committed relationship because the demand for men is higher and so this type of behaviour, which is desired by men, is more accepted. On the other hand, when sex ratios are low, promiscuity is less common because <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> demand and since they desire monogamy and commitment, in order for men to remain competitive in the pool of mates, they must respond to these desires. [...] Support for this theory comes from evidence showing higher divorce rates in countries with lower sex ratios and higher monogamy rates in countries with higher sex ratios.|$|E
2500|$|Patriarchal values heavily {{govern the}} social {{structure}} in Pakistani society in the rural areas. In comparison, urban centers {{of the country as}} well as semi-peripheral regions are slowly moving towards shifting gender roles that are more inclusive. Around 70% of working women in Pakistan work outdoors according to the Asian Development Bank policy brief on female workforce participation in Pakistan 2016. The general perception of culturally traditional gender roles that, specifically, a woman is expected {{to take care of the}} home as wife and mother, whereas the male dominates outside the home as a breadwinner, are questionable in certain sectors. In agricultural work, within rural areas, both men and women work in the fields and are expected to contribute equally to household work. In a survey by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics 2013-2014, it was reported that 26% of <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the labor force ( [...] approximately 15 million). There is a traditionally conceptual idea of segregation of men and women into two distinct worlds. However, this materializes differently in different parts of the country. Only in the most of rural-isolated regions in the country [...] is this idea of gender roles strictly followed. Poverty is one of the major factors in unequal household resources allocation in the favor of sons due to their role in society outside the home. Therefore, education for boys is prioritized over girls, because it is perceived that boys must be equipped with educational skills to compete for resources in the public arena; while girls have to specialize in domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Hence, education is not perceived as being important for girls.|$|E
