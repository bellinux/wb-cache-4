Players can use a variety of arrows with their bow, each varying in properties; for example, [...] "water arrows" [...] can be used to douse torches and any other source of fire as well as clean up blood stains, while [...] "rope arrows" [...] can create a climbable rope from <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and [...] "fire arrows" [...] can relight torches and do considerable damage to NPCs. Other tools are also available, including lockpicks, [...] "flashbombs" [...] (which can stun NPCs for a brief few moments), potions. The player can cycle through the inventories for weapons/arrows and tools through the HUD. In addition, players can be purchase additional arrows and tools between levels with the loot they have acquired (both loot and remaining items, do not roll over between missions), and find additional items during a level. Players can also find books and scrolls that can contain information on in-game lore or useful clues to get around an obstacle in a level, as well as food that can be eaten, and keys that can unlock doors and chests/crates.|$|E

On {{the white}} surface thus prepared, the colors, ground finely with linseed oil, were applied, {{according}} to the advice of Theophilus, in not less than three successive coats, and finally protected with amber or sandarac varnish: each coat of color being carefully dried by the aid of heat or in the sun before a second was applied, and the entire work before varnishing. The practice of carefully drying each coat was continued in the best periods of art, but the necessity {{of exposure to the}} sun intimated by Theophilus appears to have arisen only from his careless preparation of the linseed oil, and ignorance of a proper drying medium. Consequent on this necessity is the restriction in Theophilus, St. Audemar, and in the British Museum MS., of oil-painting to <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces,</b> because movable panels could be dried in the sun; while, for walls, the colors are to be mixed with water, wine, gum, or the usual tempera vehicles, egg and fig-tree juice; white lead and verdigris, themselves dryers, being the only pigments which could be mixed with oil for walls. But the MS. of Eraclius and the records of our English cathedrals imply no such absolute restriction. They mention the employment of oil for the painting or varnishing of columns and interior walls, and in quantity very remarkable. Among the entries relating to St. Stephen's chapel, occur--"For 19 flagons of painter's oil, at 3s. 4d. the flagon, 43s. 4d." [...] (It might be as well, in the next edition, to correct the copyist's reverse of the position of the X and L, lest it should be thought that the principles of the science of arithmetic have been progressive, {{as well as those of}} art.) And presently afterwards, in May of the same year, [...] "to John de Hennay, for seventy flagons and a half of painter's oil for the painting of the same chapel, at 20d. the flagon, 117s. 6d." [...] The expression [...] "painter's oil" [...] seems to imply more careful preparation than that directed by Theophilus, probably purification from its mucilage in the sun; but artificial heat was certainly employed to assist the drying, and after reading of flagons supplied by the score, we can hardly be surprised at finding charcoal furnished by the cartload--see an entry relating to the Painted Chamber. In one MS. of Eraclius, however, a distinct description of a drying oil in the modern sense, occurs, white lead and lime being added, and the oil thickened by exposure to the sun, as was the universal practice in Italy.|$|E

30|$|For a {{more clear}} issue, we {{consider}} {{how to move}} a bolt while being wound on a <b>wooden</b> <b>surface.</b> If a bit of pressure put on it {{just the tip of}} the bolt rotates (two-dimensional motion) on a <b>wooden</b> <b>surface,</b> and in this case, it just means a twirl. But if we put more pressure on it, along with the rotation of bolt tip, it can also penetrate into the <b>wooden</b> <b>surface</b> (third dimension of the transition can move perpendicular to the surface or not). Obviously, with increasing the pressure on the screw bolt, the bolt goes into the wood; and in this case, we see only a hole on the <b>wooden</b> <b>surface.</b> In this example, the rotary motion to add a transitional move can represent that torsion is more accurate. Note that the concepts of this example can be generalized to the super surface and space-time with the higher dimensions.|$|R

50|$|In January 2014, Monica Metz, Branch Chief of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition’s Dairy and Egg Branch, {{responded to}} a New York State Department of Agriculture request asking the FDA to clarify if using <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces</b> to age cheese was acceptable. In her response, Metz said the use of <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces</b> to ripen cheese does not conform to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices. Metz cited 21 CFR 110.40(a), to support her stance on the issue.This {{statement}} caused the concern {{of those involved in}} the artisanal cheesemaking process, and consumers who enjoy such cheeses. It was feared this direction as stated by the FDA, would harm local American cheesemakers, but also affect cheeses that follow the same practices that are imported from other nations. Many groups to include the American Cheese Society, a nonprofit trade association which promotes and supports American cheeses, created a letter on June 10, 2014, arguing against the FDA stance on using <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces</b> to ripen cheese. The American Cheese Society stressed their stance on strict safety standards during the American cheesemaking process. Additionally, they commented on how such a ruling would affect the non-manufactured cheese industry, affecting the U.S. consumer’s ability to access a multitude of different cheeses, including those created locally or abroad.On June 11, 2014, the FDA sent an update regarding their earlier displayed stance on the issue. In the update, the FDA stressed that they are not requiring the prohibiting or banning of <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the cheesemaking process. Furthermore, they stated there is no Food Safety Modernization Act that specifically mentions the use of <b>wooden</b> <b>surfaces</b> needed in the cheesemaking process. The FDA advised they would reach out to and engage the artisanal cheesemaking community, in coming together to resolve the issue.|$|E
