500|$|The song is {{predominantly}} upbeat, featuring Bieber's R vocals over a backdrop containing a dance infused beat, full of keyboard and [...] "disco string" [...] synths. The song is composed {{in the key}} of E♭ major with Bieber's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C5. According to Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, the song [...] "blends winks at Fifties doo-wop with hip-hop chants", comparing the style and the lyrics [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time/And I was like/Baby, baby, baby, ooooh/I thought you'd always be mine" [...] to fifties [...] ballads like [...] "Tears on My Pillow", [...] "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" [...] and [...] "Earth Angel". Lyrically, Bieber's lines explain his distress over his lost love, and promise to get it back, featured in lines like, [...] "And I wanna play it cool/But I'm losin' you…/I'm in pieces/So come and fix me…". The chorus features the distinct and repetitive [...] "baby, baby, baby, ohhhh (nooooo)" [...] hook. After the second verse, Ludacris comes in with the verse-rap, an anecdote of young love when he was thirteen, as it runs [...] "When I was 13/I had my first love/She had me going crazy/Oh, I was star-struck/She <b>woke</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> daily/Don't need no Starbucks…".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it <b>woke</b> <b>me</b> <b>up.</b> Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really <b>woke</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Bowles {{published}} his translation of Jorge Luis Borges' short story, [...] "The Circular Ruins". It was {{collected in a}} book of 16 stories, all translated by Bowles, called She <b>Woke</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> So I Killed Her. This Borges story had previously been published in translations by the three main Borges translators: Anthony Kerrigan, Anthony Bonner, and James E. Irby. Critics have noted the differences amongst these four translations. Bowles' version is in his typical prose style; it is readily distinguishable from the other three, which have a more conservative idiomatic form of translation.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{remarkable}} turnaround, Lewis {{became the most}} bankable country star in the world. [...] He was so hot in 1970 that his former Smash producer Shelby Singleton, who purchased Sun Records from Sam Phillips in July 1969, {{wasted no time in}} repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. [...] One of his latter unreleased Sun recordings, [...] "One Minute Past Eternity," [...] was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent Mercury hit [...] "She Even <b>Woke</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> To Say Goodbye." [...] Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following The Golden Cream of the Country with A Taste of Country later in 1970.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, {{including}} four chart toppers. [...] Hits include [...] "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", [...] "To Make Love Sweeter For You", [...] "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", [...] "Since I Met You Baby", [...] "Once More With Feeling", [...] "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and [...] "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as Another Place, Another Time and She Even <b>Woke</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> To Say Goodbye, was sparse, {{quite different from}} the slick [...] "Nashville sound" [...] that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. [...] The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard. [...] In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording [...] "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' <b>woke</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> to {{just how}} awful some summer {{entertainments}} have become. It isn't {{that the film}} is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, {{but that it is}} truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, [...] "'Knight and Day' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like 'Charade' or 'Romancing the Stone,' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. But why do so many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I'd sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they're essentially replaced by animation." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle." [...] Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, [...] "Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action – and the story itself – spin ridiculously out of control." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, [...] "Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O'Neill, accelerates events {{in a way that is}} either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that's wrong with movies today. Maybe it's both." [...] Joshua Starnes of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 6.5 out of 10, and concluded his review, [...] "Instead of watching it, you're better off putting [...] "Knight and Day" [...] in a time capsule and singing some Don McLean, 'cause this is the day the movie star died." [...] In a subsequent [...] "mini review", Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, and concluded, [...] "The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [...] on screen together and that's what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action." [...] In a review for CNN, Tom Charity commented, [...] "there's a creeping anxiety about this project, a tendency to over-compensate that speaks to underlying inadequacies." ...|$|E
