5000|$|The income {{derived from}} land unlawfully {{held by the}} possessor, {{for which he is}} {{answerable}} to the true owner when the latter recovers the land from him by the judgment of a court. The Talmud speaks of the possessor of land without right as the [...] "robber of the land" [...] (in English law, [...] "disseizor"); and he, or even a third person who takes fruits or branches from land thus withheld from the true owner, is considered as morally guilty of robbery (see the prohibition of an Israelite using, in the ritual thyrsus on the Feast of Booths, a palm-branch or citron taken from land held by a disseizor iv. 1, 2). The liability to pay mesne profits is implied and rather distantly indicated in the Mishnah (Giṭ. v. 2). Assuming that he who sells land with warranty is liable not only for the price of the land which he receives, but also for the mesne profits which the purchaser will have to pay after eviction to the true owner, it is here taught that from motives of public policy the <b>warranty</b> inserted <b>in</b> the <b>deed</b> of sale, though in the nature of a bond, is to be levied, as far as it secures the purchaser against this liability, only upon [...] "free property," [...] not on [...] "subjected property," [...] i.e., on lands which in the meanwhile have been given away, sold, or encumbered (for the distinction see Deed). The Gemara (B. M. 14a, b) discusses this matter fully {{in the light of the}} warranty, the liability of the unlawful possessor being taken for granted (see Maimonides, [...] "Yad," [...] Gezelah, ch. xiv.).|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the legal effect of breach of <b>warranty</b> <b>in</b> construction insurance contracts in Malaysia {{in light of the}} current developments in The English insurance law. The required data and information were collected from Malaysian and English court decisions dealing with breach of <b>warranties</b> <b>in</b> English marine insurance law from the online Malayan Law Journal published on the LexisNexis online database and from published textbooks related to insurance warranties. This study would help to offer judicial guidance to courts in Peninsular Malaysia on how to resolve the legal dilemma associated with breach of <b>warranty</b> <b>in</b> Malaysian insurance law. It was found out that the effect of breach of a continuing <b>warranty</b> will result <b>in</b> the contract of insurance remaining in existence and the risk is being treated as having incepted at the outset but automatically coming to an end as of the date of the breach. More so, the insurer is being discharged from any future liability, although any liabilities of the insurer before the date of the breach are unaffected...|$|R

In this respect, we show the suboptimality of the equilibria with <b>warranty.</b> <b>In</b> the second stage, we analyze the role of signaling and reputation in an intertemporal model. In this context the final quality of the product depends on whether quality and effort are complements or substitutes...|$|R
