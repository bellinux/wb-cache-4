40|$|High resolution, in vivo optical imaging of {{the mouse}} brain over time often {{requires}} anesthesia, which necessitates maintaining the animal's body temperature and level of anesthesia, as well as securing the head in an optimal, stable position. Controlling each parameter usually requires using multiple systems. Assembling multiple components into the small space on a standard microscope stage can be difficult and some commercially available parts simply do not fit. Furthermore, it is time-consuming to position an animal in the identical position over multiple imaging sessions for longitudinal studies. This is especially true when using an implanted gradient index (GRIN) lens for deep brain imaging. The multiphoton laser beam must be parallel with the shaft of the lens because even a slight tilt of the lens can degrade image quality. In response to these challenges, we have designed a compact, integrated in vivo imaging support system to overcome the problems created by using separate systems during optical imaging in mice. It is a single platform that provides (1) sturdy head fixation, (2) an integrated gas anesthesia mask, and (3) safe <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> <b>heating.</b> This THREE-IN-ONE (TRIO) Platform has a small footprint and a low profile that positions a mouse’s head only 20 mm above the microscope stage. This height is about one half to one third the height of most commercially available immobilization devices. We have successfully employed this system, using isoflurane in over 40 imaging sessions {{with an average of}} 2 h per session with no leaks or other malfunctions. Due to its smaller size, the TRIO Platform can be used with a wider range of upright microscopes and stages. Most of the components were designed in SOLIDWORKS® and fabricated using a 3 D printer. This additive manufacturing approach also readily permits size modifications for creating systems for other small animals...|$|E

In using <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> there are some patients with injured skin who do not complain of pain and/or itching and ordinary patients with skin injured as much as former who complain of pain and/or itching. This made us think {{that there must be}} a difference in the <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> used by these patients. Usually we get <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from gas instantly <b>heated</b> <b>water</b> or from electrically <b>heated</b> stored <b>water.</b> In patients using <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from gas instantly <b>heated</b> <b>water</b> the complaints were more frequent than in patients using <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from electrically <b>heated</b> stored <b>water.</b> Residual chlorine in water is well known to be the main factor worsening skin disease.

40|$|Large {{quantities}} {{of natural gas}} hydrate are present in marine sediments along the coastlines of many countries {{as well as in}} arctic regions. This research is aimed at assessing production of natural gas from the marine deposits. We had developed a multiphase, multicomponent, thermal, 3 D simulator in the past, which can simulate production of hydrates both in equilibrium and kinetic modes.

In this work, we simulate depressurization and <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> flooding for hydrate production in a hydrate reservoir underlain by a water layer. Water flooding has been studied as a function of injection temperature, injection pressure and production pressure. For high injection temperature, the higher pressure increases the flow of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> (<b>heat)</b> in the reservoir making the production rate faster, but if injection temperature is not high then only depressurization is the best method of production.

50|$|Other {{discernible}} {{features of}} the interhemispheric dipole noted in the aforementioned study, include a strengthened, anomalous downwelling in the hemisphere that is characterized by positive SST anomalies and a respective, less prevalent upwelling in the negative SST anomalies-hemisphere. Furthermore, diabatic heating perturbations are also shown {{to be linked to}} cross-equatorial SST changes, with positive anomalies being observed over the <b>warmer</b> Northern hemisphere <b>waters</b> and negative ones over the Southern hemisphere. A strong connection is also found between the tropical Atlantic SST dipole and the overlying atmosphere; enhanced convective patterns and anomalous precipitation appear correlated with warm NH SSTs, whereas the opposite phase is observed across the equator, over the cooler SH waters. Finally, a connection is discerned between the surface and sub-surface interhemispheric pattern-related SSTs. Northern SST anomalies appear to permeate vertically below the ocean surface reaching thermocline (THC) depths and inciting in this way THC anomalies of up to 3m. This provides additional evidence of the critical role of surface ocean currents in transporting <b>warm</b> <b>waters</b> and <b>heat</b> meridionally, since surface wind-induced Ekman puming appears to be the key contributor for such THC and heat content anomalies.|$|R

The emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) {{model for a}} continuous packed-bed biomass dryer. The model minimizes total drying costs, including both capital and operational costs, of the dryer. Heated air, which flows through a biomass bed and perforated conveyor, is used as drying gas by the dryer. We define the dryer size {{with the help of}} an experimentally-measured characteristic drying curve. The MILP model is tested in a case study where the dryer is assumed to have been installed at a Scandinavian pulp and paper mill. There are three different heat sources available for the heating of drying air: <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> at 60 °C, <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> at 80 °C and backpressure steam at the pressure of 0. 4 MPa. The results indicate that, in practice, the use of only low-temperature <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> flows for <b>heating</b> of drying air is the most economic method when their prices are low (below 1 € MWh- 1 in the case study). <b>Warm</b> <b>water</b> flows are usually waste heat from pulp and paper mills and their prices are low compared to the price of back-pressure steam (typically from 10 to 15 € MWh- 1). The use of steam for drying may be reasonable if the price of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> is for some reason clearly higher than the price of a typical waste-heat stream. The MILP model presented in this work can be used for minimizing drying costs of any material (not only biomass) dried in a continuous packed-bed dryer if the characteristic drying curve of the material is available...|$|R
