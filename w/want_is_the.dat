5|$|Freedom from <b>Want</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{third in}} a series of four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms by Norman Rockwell. They were inspired by , known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, but the government used them to help boost patriotism. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6), and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E

Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal". She proceeds in the chorus: [...] "You can have it all but you never stop / 'Cause all you ever <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cherry on top" [...] / [...] "And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough / You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top".|$|E

2500|$|In January 1912 Jack Joyce's Wild West Show was {{appearing}} at Coliseum in London. Later, in May of that year, {{it was the}} big attraction at the New Hippodrome Palast in Berlin. The popular American cowboy had with him about a half dozen boys from Texas and a troupe of fake Indians. The [...] "demand for a wild west show {{is so great that}} the Germans don't worry about the genuineness of the red skin--all they <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> excitement connected with the show." [...] Joyce had a pretty strong feeling for cowgirls. Although they were not easily found in Berlin, he did not worry. He made a selection among a throng of Berlin maidens and trained them to be cowgirls. In 1916 Jack Joyce was doing well with his circus and wild west show touring Sweden.
