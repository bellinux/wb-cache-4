The rider was en route from SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. Since Bond is already in Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation in any <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider: as expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond.

But the prince turns her away solely for her appearance. The old woman warns him not to be fooled by appearances, as true beauty lies within, only to be rejected again.

25|$|Another {{specific}} {{source for the}} final scene is discernible when Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. This is {{a reference to the}} story of Verginia from Livy's Ab urbe condita (c.26 B.C.). Around 451 B.C., a decemvir of the Roman Republic, Appius Claudius Crassus, begins to lust after Verginia, a plebeian girl betrothed to a former tribune, Lucius Icilius. She rejects Claudius' advances, enraging him, and he has her abducted. However, both Icilius and Verginia's father, famed centurion Lucius Verginius, are respected figures and Claudius is forced to legally defend his right to hold Verginia. At the Forum, Claudius threatens the assembly with violence, and Verginius' supporters flee. Seeing that defeat is imminent, Verginius asks Claudius if he may speak to his daughter alone, to which Claudius agrees. However, Verginius stabs Verginia, determining that her death is the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> secure her freedom.|$|E

25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E

Upon Pogba's departure from Juventus in 2016, his former teammate Gianluigi Buffon compared him to French former playmakers Michel Platini and Zinedine Zidane, and also praised his ability, leadership, work-rate and attitude, both on the pitch and in training, stating that he [...] "..is a tremendous warrior on the pitch but also has so much talent.

A former colleague, Dave Hess (Scott Bryce), who left NBC for Kabletown, reveals that Kabletown's success comes from running pay-per-view adult channels; the company runs [...] "the perfect business" [...] and needs no investment in new services or products. On learning this, Jack is horrified at the prospect of no longer making things. Later, however, while giving a eulogy at former GE CEO Don Geiss's (Rip Torn) funeral, he has an epiphany and proposes to Kabletown executives that they produce [...] "porn for women" [...] (specifically, channels featuring attractive men who [...] "listen" [...] while women blather on).|$|E

[...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot said Dr. Dre's production boasted unique elements but [...] "the endless gangsta babble, with its casual misogyny and flippant violence," [...] sounded flagrantly trite. AllMusic's Erlewine spoke of how the number of guest rappers affected the album, and questioned his reasons for collaborating with [...] "pedestrian rappers". He claimed that [...] "the album suffers considerably as a result [...] ". Erlewine criticized the lyrics, which he said were repetitive and full of [...] "gangsta clichés". Sinclair mentioned similar views of the lyrics, calling them [...] "filthy", but noted [...] "none of [...] should diminish Dre's achievement". NME spoke of how the lyrics were too explicit, stating, [...] "As the graphic grooves stretch out, littered with gunfire, bombings and 'copters over Compton, and the bitch-beating baton is handed from Knock-Turnal to Kurupt, 2001 reaches gangsta-rap parody-level with too many tracks coming off like porno-Wu outtakes."

Pam points out that {{if she were to}} get a new computer for one sales rep, she would have to get one for every sales rep. Unwilling to let it go, Andy convinces Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) into trading computers with him. Pam is angry when she finds out, and forces him to switch the computers back. In addition to continue pushing for a new computer, Andy confronts Pam about humiliating him in front of the office. In order to make it up to him, she tells him that the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> get a new computer is if his breaks. To accomplish this, he accepts all cookies, intentionally opens pop-up ads, and places food in the disc drive. Pam then buys Andy a new computer, but they scratch it up to make it not look brand new.

Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) confronts Pam later regarding finding the computer in the warehouse. As he knows everything that is in the warehouse and where it is stored, he leverages Pam into giving him more sick days.

500|$|Zack is {{the protagonist}} of Crisis Core, a prequel to Final Fantasy VII, which deals {{primarily}} with Zack's backstory. In the game, Zack is trained as a SOLDIER by his close friend, Angeal Hewley, and hopes to become a hero while working for Shinra. When Angeal, and another SOLDIER, Genesis Rhapsodos, betray Shinra, Zack and Sephiroth are dispatched to kill them, but they decide to avoid doing that if possible. He and Sephiroth learn that both Angeal and Genesis {{were the result of}} a Shinra experiment called [...] "Project G", where they were injected with Jenova cells prior to being born in an effort to create perfect SOLDIERs. However, both Angeal and Genesis are suffering from secondary effects which led them to antagonize Shinra in the hopes of finding a cure. In the course of the game, Zack befriends Cloud and begins dating Aerith. During a mission to find Angeal and Genesis, Angeal forces Zack to kill him, as he wants to stop hurting people because of his mutations. Before dying, Angeal thanks Zack for stopping him and gives him his Buster Sword. Later, while Zack and Sephiroth search for Genesis and the former Shinra scientist Dr. Hollander, they go to Nibelheim where Sephiroth learns that he too was the result of genetic experimentation involving Jenova. The game then depicts the Nibelheim incident, leading to Zack and Cloud being taken captive and subjected to experiments themselves. Four years pass, Zack and Cloud are able to escape, and Zack learns that Genesis has come to believe the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be cured is by being injected with Sephiroth's cells. As Sephiroth is thought dead, the only source of these cells is now Cloud, and Zack realises that Genesis plans to kill Cloud. Zack decides to stop Genesis, and after defeating him, he and Cloud head to Midgar, where he hopes to be reunited with Aerith. However, Zack and Cloud are intercepted by Shinra infantry, and Zack is killed. In his dying breath, Zack gives the Buster Sword to Cloud, telling him to be his living legacy. As Cloud stumbles off towards Midgar, Zack is pulled into the sky by Angeal, and wonders if he has become a hero.|$|E
