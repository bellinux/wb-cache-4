25|$|The {{cash fare}} for Muni Metro, like Muni buses, {{effective}} July 1, 2017, is $2.75 {{for adults and}} $1.35 for youth ages 5–17, seniors, and the disabled. Like Muni buses, the Muni Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system; on paying a fare, the passenger will receive a ticket good for travel on any bus, historic streetcar, or Metro vehicle for 90 minutes. Payment methods depend on boarding location. On surface street sections {{in the south and}} west of the city, passengers can board {{at the front of the}} train and pay their fare to the train operator to receive their ticket; those <b>who</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a ticket, or who have a daily, weekly, or monthly pass, can board at any door of the Metro streetcar. Subway stations have controlled entries via faregates, and passengers usually purchase or show Muni staff a ticket in order to enter the platform area. Faregates closest to an unmanned Muni staff booth open automatically if a passenger has a valid pass or transfer that cannot be scanned. Muni's fare inspectors may board trains at any time to check for proof of payment from passengers.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, women <b>who</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a female child often face additional pressures to have male children that add to their overall stress level.|$|E
