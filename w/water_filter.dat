25|$|In Australia, {{there are}} no {{quantitative}} performance targets for rainwater tanks, such as size of tank or targeted reductions in potable water demand, in policies or guidelines. The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be {{designed to provide a}} reliable source of water to supplement mains water supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is reduced), cost, available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards. An advised suitable configuration may include a <b>water</b> <b>filter</b> or first flush diversion, a mains water top-up supply (dual supply system), maintenance drain, a pump (pressure system), and an on-site retention provision.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Series 1, the Mall Rats {{struggle}} {{to survive in}} the new world. The tribe is confronted with water and food shortage. Jack and Dal work on a sand <b>water</b> <b>filter</b> that allows them to drink rain water. They also make a wind turbine that allows them to trade batteries for food. The members of the new tribe at first find it difficult to live with each other. They all have different opinions and tend to put their own interests first. Amber, Bray and Lex compete for leadership and barely agree to share the responsibilities. Amber takes care of day-to-day management, Bray supplies food and Lex is named Head of Security. The characters also have to deal with personal problems inside their tribe. Trudy suffers from postnatal depression and Patsy's twin brother, Paul, goes missing without a trace. Salene suffers from bulimia (which goes through to season 2), but finds comfort in Trudy and Ryan.|$|E
500|$|The {{expressway}} continues {{due east}} {{along the southern}} edge of the valley. The opposing lanes split as the expressway passes beneath the Leaside Bridge, the southbound lanes at a lower level. The lanes rejoin as they approach the Don Mills Road interchange at the [...] "forks of the Don". Just east of the Don Mills Road interchange, several large white sculptures resembling human teeth are installed {{on both sides of the}} road. The sculptures, called The Elevated Wetlands, are examples of [...] "eco-art" [...] and have become a landmark. The sculptures resemble concrete but are made of plastic and filled with waste plastic and wetland plants. The sculptures function as a <b>water</b> <b>filter,</b> removing pollutants from the Don River. A solar-powered pump lifts water to the top of the sculpture and it is returned to the Don after filtration. The sculptures were installed in 1998 and the wetland plants added in 1999.|$|E

60|$|A great personage on an American {{train is}} the newsboy. He sells books (such books!), papers, fruit, lollipops, and cigars; and on {{emigrant}} journeys, soap, towels, tin washing dishes, tin coffee pitchers, coffee, tea, sugar, and tinned eatables, mostly hash or beans and bacon. Early {{next morning the}} newsboy went around the cars, and chumming on a more extended principle became {{the order of the}} hour. It requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds; but washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a syndicate of three. I myself entered a little after sunrise into articles of agreement, and became one of the firm of Pennsylvania, Shakespeare, and Dubuque. Shakespeare was my own nickname on the cars; Pennsylvania that of my bedfellow; and Dubuque, the name of a place in the State of Iowa, that of an amiable young fellow going west to cure an asthma, and retarding his recovery by incessantly chewing or smoking, and sometimes chewing and smoking together. I have never seen tobacco so sillily abused. Shakespeare bought a tin washing-dish, Dubuque a towel, and Pennsylvania a brick of soap. The partners used these instruments, one after another, according to the order of their first awaking; and when the firm had finished there was no want of borrowers. Each filled the tin dish at the <b>water</b> <b>filter</b> opposite the stove, and retired with the whole stock in trade to the platform of the car. There he knelt down, supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one elbow crooked about the railing, and made a shift to wash his face and neck and hands; a cold, an insufficient, and, if the train is moving rapidly, a somewhat dangerous toilet.|$|E
