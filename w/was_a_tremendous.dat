5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> {{public outcry}} when Ward {{was found not}} guilty. Newspapers across the nation {{condemned}} the verdict and Crittenden {{for his role in}} securing it. Only Prentice, in the Courier-Journal, defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden's resignation from the Senate. After one such meeting, a mob gathered and Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve jurors were burned in effigy.|$|E
5|$|Having {{purchased}} the film rights to Journey's End, British producers Michael Balcon and Thomas Welsh agreed that Whale's experience directing the London and Broadway productions {{of the play}} made him the best choice to direct the film. The two partnered with a small American studio, Tiffany-Stahl, to shoot it in New York. Colin Clive reprised his role as Stanhope, and David Manners was cast as Raleigh. Filming got underway on 6 December 1929 and wrapped on 22 January 1930. Journey's End was released in Great Britain on 14 April and in the United States on 15 April. On {{both sides of the}} Atlantic the film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{the play}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> {{financial}} success; the previews broke attendance records. In Boston, the show sold out {{even after the}} addition of extra matinées. The first week on Broadway took in nearly $ 20,000, close to the maximum the Shubert Theatre could generate at normal prices. However, ticket sales fell off rapidly following the strongly negative reviews. Woods pre-sold four weeks of tickets to local ticket brokers, which helped the box office totals, but the brokers were left with unsold seats even after offering deep discounts. After leaving New York, the show returned to strong sales on the road.|$|E

5|$|The opera {{was first}} given in January 1957 at La Scala in Italian translation. Between then and the French premiere Poulenc {{introduced}} {{one of his}} most popular late works, the Flute Sonata, which he and Jean-Pierre Rampal performed in June at the Strasbourg Festival. Three days later, on 21 June, came the Paris premiere of Dialogues des Carmélites at the Opéra. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> success, to the composer's considerable relief. At around this time Poulenc began his last romantic relationship, with Louis Gautier, a former soldier; they remained partners to the end of Poulenc's life.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, Sabina had {{delivered}} the libretto {{for a second}} opera, a light comedy entitled The Bartered Bride, which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because {{of the success of}} The Brandenburgers, the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue. The opera went through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation. The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on one of the hottest evenings of the year, {{on the eve of the}} Austro-Prussian War, with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by Prussian troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs. When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> public success.|$|E

25|$|William Gibson's Neuromancer, {{published}} in 1984, announced the cyberpunk {{movement to the}} larger literary world and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> commercial success. Other key writers in the movement included Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, and later Neal Stephenson. Though Cyberpunk would later be cross-pollinated with other styles of science fiction, {{there seemed to be}} some notion of ideological purity in the beginning. John Shirley compared the Cyberpunk movement to a tribe.|$|E

During his absence one of Tāmati Wāka Nene's allies, the Hokianga chief, Makoare Te Taonui, attacked and captured Te Ahuahu. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> blow to Heke's mana or prestige, obviously it had to be recaptured as soon as possible.|$|E
25|$|Reform {{began as}} a Western protest party {{in the minds of}} most Canadians. Its heavy {{concentration}} of support in the West netted it 52 seats. However, the Bloc Québécois's concentration of support in Quebec was slightly larger, leaving Reform three seats short of Official Opposition status despite finishing second in the popular vote. Even with these disappointments, the 1993 election <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> success for Reform. In one stroke, it had replaced the Progressive Conservative Party as the major right-wing party in Canada.|$|E

They were celebrated in the media as national heroes. However, during the Russo-Japanese War, the admiration of their friends and neighbors turned sour, they lost their pensions, were accused of being spies, and had to suffer harassment from the police.|$|E

25|$|The old rivalry ran hot as Moore's and Irving's sternwheelers {{raced up}} and down the Fraser, {{competing}} for passengers. To compete with Moore, Irving built a new sternwheeler in 1881, the $80,000 Elizabeth J Irving, which on its second trip to Yale, raced Moore's Western Slope and, midway through the race, caught on fire and was soon reduced to a charred wreck, resulting in the deaths of four First Nations crewmen, two horses and two cows. The loss <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> blow to John Irving, who had just allowed the vessel's insurance to expire a week earlier.|$|E
