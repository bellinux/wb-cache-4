5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted {{management of the}} bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause {{the defeat of the}} bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, 2011, Gumby Comics/Wildcard Ink {{published}} a single volume collecting Adams' previous two specials featuring Gumby. The book was initially called Gumby's Arthur Adams Specials, but was eventually published with a sticker covering Adams' {{name on the}} cover, effectively renaming the book Gumby's Spring Specials. According to Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool, this was done on Adams' request, who <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the publisher, and took action to keep his name off the book's cover. The book is nonetheless sold by merchants such as Mile High Comics under its originally intended name.|$|E

25|$|The 1954 movie Salt of the Earth, {{directed}} by Herbert J. Biberman, {{a member of}} the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, portrays a year-and-a-half long strike by New Mexico zinc miners who belonged to Mine Mill; many of the actors were rank-and-file members of that union. The producers found it difficult, however, to recruit Anglo actors to play strikebreakers or deputy sheriffs; those who disliked the union <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it, while those who sympathized {{did not want to be}} seen switching sides, even as actors.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, {{the town}} of Port Arthur was {{authorized}} to construct and operate the first municipally owned street railway in Canada. The Port Arthur Street Railway (PASRy) commenced operations in March 1892, and in that same year, McDonald and Company commenced operations of a private street railway in neighbouring Fort William, which connected the Port Arthur Street Railway's southern terminus at Fort William's northern town limits into the downtown core of Fort William. Although Fort William <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Port Arthur's municipal railway, PASRy gained control of the McDonald and Company line on June 1, 1893, and extended its operations into the town.|$|E
25|$|In French control {{after the}} war, the airport sat {{abandoned}} for years. There was much unexploded ordnance {{at the site}} which needed to be removed, {{as well as the}} wreckage of German and Allied aircraft. All of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the Allied air attacks or demolition, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. The French Air Force <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a Nazi airfield on French soil, and as a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions.|$|E

25|$|In French control {{after the}} war, the base sat {{abandoned}} for several years. There was much un-exploded ordnance {{at the site}} which needed to be removed, {{as well as the}} wreckage of German and American aircraft.

25|$|From January 1993 {{until my}} {{resignation}} from the United Nations in August 1998, I witnessed first hand the duplicitous Iraq {{policies of the}} administration of Bill Clinton, the implementation of which saw a President lie to the American people about a threat he knew was hyped, lie to Congress about his support of a disarmament process his administration <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with, and lie to the world about American intent, which turned its back on the very multilateral embrace of diplomacy {{as reflected in the}} resolutions of the Security Council Hillary Clinton so piously refers to in her speech, and instead pursued a policy defined by the unilateral interests of the Clinton administration to remove Saddam Hussein from power.|$|E
25|$|Carlton Gary {{was born}} on September 24, 1950 in Columbus, Georgia. His father was a {{construction}} worker who <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him and would accept no financial responsibility for him. Gary only met his father once, when he was twelve years old. Gary's mother was extremely poor and as a result, they moved around a lot. He was malnourished {{most of the time}} and was often left with his aunt or great aunt, both maids for elderly, wealthy, white women. In elementary school, Gary suffered serious head trauma when he was knocked unconscious in a playground accident, and in his teens, he was a heavy drug user. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he was arrested multiple times for robbery, arson, and assault. During that time, he also got married to a woman named Sheila, and had two children. In 1970, he moved to Albany, New York, where he had plans to become a singer, but he continued to carry out his criminal activities.|$|E

500|$|Following the victory, McGovern harbored {{thoughts}} of {{running in the}} 1976 presidential election, but given the magnitude of his presidential defeat, the Democratic Party <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him then or later. Unfamiliar and uncomfortable with Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter, McGovern secretly voted for Ford instead. McGovern's view on intervention in Southeast Asia took a turn in 1978 {{in reaction to the}} ongoing Cambodian genocide. Noting that it affected a percentage of the population which made [...] "Hitler's operation look tame", he advocated an international military intervention in Cambodia to put the Khmer Rouge regime out of power.|$|E
500|$|Catherine Black {{has found}} Dickerson's {{biological}} mother, a Mrs. Dechant (Lynda Boyd). Having given Dickerson {{up for adoption}} as a teenager, she is now a suburban housewife. Dickerson had tried several years previously to reconnect with her, though she <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him. Catherine asks her for help, and she begrudgingly agrees to see her son. She recoils when he hugs her, blaming the government for making him what he is. Rejected, Dickerson confesses to the murders. Connor is able {{to see all of}} this, his connection to it not yet uncovered. Frank Black is unconvinced that everything has been wrapped up, and realizes that Connor is involved—he wants Dickerson to himself. [...] "Stop looking" [...] was his message to Dickerson, to stop looking for affection anywhere else.|$|E
500|$|In {{the media}} Vizzini was often {{depicted}} as the [...] "boss of bosses" [...] – although {{such a position}} {{did not exist in}} the loose structure of Cosa Nostra, and later Mafia turncoats denied he ever was the boss of the Mafia in Sicily. According to the pentito Tommaso Buscetta the title capo dei capi or [...] "boss of bosses" [...] did not exist in Cosa Nostra. According to author John Dickie, [...] "the question is if Vizzini was as dominant in the Mafia as he was famous outside it." [...] In the matter of Mafia support for the separatist movement, other Cosa Nostra bosses sidelined Vizzini, who was considered to be tainted by his association with radical separatist leaders Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile and Lucio Tasca. These bosses <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with either the island’s bandits or EVIS, to which Vizzini and Lucio Tasca were suspected to be connected. According to the pentito Antonio Calderone Vizzini never had been the boss of Cosa Nostra of Sicily.|$|E

500|$|A {{year into}} Park's life sentence, around 40 {{family members and}} friends held a vigil at Strangeways Prison, in a bid to raise {{awareness}} of [...] "the fact that there is an innocent man in prison". Another was held a year later, led by Jenny Park, and a third on the third anniversary of Park's imprisonment. It was due to these vigils, claimed Evangelical Pastor George Harrison, that he was barred from visiting Park once he was transferred to Garth prison, in Lancashire. Other fronts for the campaign included an offer of £5,000 for anyone providing evidence that lead to Gordon's freedom. Included in this were planned adverts in the North-West Evening Mail and leaflets to 20,000 homes in the Furness area. However, this was being organised by Harrison, with whom Gordon and his third wife Jennifer stayed during the trial. Jeremy Park wrote to the North-West Evening Mail to confirm that he <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the reward, and that Harrison had no right to include his name, contact details or email address, or mention the freegordon website, in the adverts. Subsequently, Harrison claimed to have delivered 6,000 booklets and leaflets in the Furness area.|$|E
500|$|By February 1856 Morton {{had made}} his way to the newly formed Republican party at the {{national}} level as a member of the resolutions committee to the preliminary national convention that met in Pittsburgh. He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Thirty-two-year-old Morton became the People's/Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856. His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard, a popular state senator. Despite a hard-fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state, Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6,000 votes, amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting. Radical Republican George W. Julian, who detested Morton, contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery, and, as conservative former Whigs claimed, he had been too lenient on the issue in a state where southern-born residents <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with blacks or abolitionism. Despite these criticisms, Morton's anti-slavery speeches made him popular among the Republicans in Indiana. Noted for his [...] "plain and convincing" [...] manner of speaking, Morton's contemporaries said he was not [...] "eloquent or witty", but rather [...] "logical and reasonable".|$|E
500|$|In October, after {{realizing he}} lacked the funds to pursue the {{projects}} he wanted to, he decided instead {{to work on the}} Voldo video project using the song [...] "Hot in Herre". However, the only partner he had to create the video with was his roommate, who wished to be credited anonymously as [...] "Msr. M." [...] and initially <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. After seeing Brandt work on the concept by himself however, M. decided to help under the stipulation that the project's schedule fit around his drinking habit. Development of the choreography was completed the next day, and the following five days were devoted to producing the video at five-hour intervals for each day, while the music played through the television via a PlayStation 2's audio cable. However, by the fifth day, both realized that the music was actually distracting, and Brandt recorded himself counting out the beat of the song. Using this as the audio track, they were able to complete the project easily, and after editing the video Brandt released two versions online, with the latter utilizing the song [...] "Kiss" [...] by Prince.|$|E

500|$|S {{director}} J. T. Petty {{originally intended}} {{the film to}} focus on a man who lived near his childhood home; the man often spied on, and filmed, his neighbors. The footage led to an indictment towards [...] "the peeper", who recorded 191 videotapes of Petty's childhood neighborhood. The indictment implied the footage should be viewed in court, but the people in the neighborhood opposed this owing to privacy concerns. Petty said of the 191 videotapes, [...] "I admired the peeping tom; he had made movies that were frightening and titillating and real." [...] The idea of using a camera to record his neighbor's house for hours fascinated him so much that he decided to direct a film about it. Although he had already secured funding, Petty was left without a subject since [...] "the peeper" [...] <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the film. Petty decided to focus on three directors, who did not direct films aimed at the general public; they directed simulated snuff films, involving murder and sexual assault. Petty found the directors— Zebub, Vogel, and Marcisak, Petty's friend who played the fictional director Rost— at the Chiller Convention, an underground horror event.|$|E
500|$|Sometime in 2012 after Isaac release, McMillen was {{approached}} by Tyrone Rodriguez of Nicalis who asked if McMillen was interested in bringing the game to consoles. McMillen was interested, but insisted {{that they would have}} to reprogram the game to get around the limitations of Flash as to include [...] "Wrath of Lamb" [...] and the second planned expansion, remaking the game's graphics in 16-bit instead of 8-bit. Further, McMillen had <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the business aspects of the game, having recounted the difficulties he had in handling this for Super Meat Boy.

500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. They were into Pavement or whatever."
