[...] Cartoonist Al Capp (1909-1979) would often use Li'l Abner continuity as a narrative framing device, bookending the offbeat Fosdick sequences. Abner himself serves as a rustic Greek chorus - to introduce, comment upon and (sometimes) comically sum up the Fosdick stories. Typically, an anxious Abner would race frantically to the mailbox or to the train delivering the morning newspapers, {{to get a glimpse of}} the latest cliffhanger episode. The next panel would reveal Abner's POV of the feature under an iconic logo: Fearless Fosdick by Lester Gooch. Subsequent installments would reinforce Abner's obsessive immersion in the unfolding Fosdick continuity while at the same time recapping the story within a story. <b>While</b> <b>oblivious</b> to the surrounding [...] "real" [...] world (e.g., walking off a cliff or into the path of an oncoming train, or inadvertently ignoring one of Daisy Mae's perilous predicaments), Abner would be, as ever, fully engrossed in the Fosdick adventure.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{complexity}} of gossip in an asynchronous, message-passing fault-prone distributed system. In short, we show that an adaptive adversary can significantly hamper the spreading of a rumor, <b>while</b> an <b>oblivious</b> adversary cannot. This latter fact implies that there exist message-efficient asynchronous (randomized) consensus protocols, {{in the context of}} an oblivious adversary. In more detail, we summarize our results as follows. If the adversary is adaptive, we show that a randomized asynchronous gossip algorithm cannot terminate in fewer than O(f(d + δ)) time steps unless Ω(n + f 2) messages are exchanged, where n is the total number of processes, f is the number of tolerated crash failures, d is the maximum communication delay for the specific execution in question...|$|R

40|$|When {{composing}} {{components that}} have been independently developed, coordinated pre-planning to ensure interoperability is not always an option. Without pre-planning, mismatches in architectures, interfaces, or protocols tend to occur that prevent the composition of components. To enable the composition of mismatched components, components must be permitted to possess inconsistent world views on the constituents of a system, their interfaces, and protocols. At composition time, the conflicts in these world views are reconciled. Each component can express only those details about the system that are important for its local operation. As a result, a component can interact with its context of operation <b>while</b> remaining <b>oblivious</b> to the concrete details there.
