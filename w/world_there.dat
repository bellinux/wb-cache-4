5|$|By this time, cricket {{had been}} {{introduced}} to India, North America and the West Indies but the first definite references occur in the 18th century. In 1709, cricket was played by William Byrd of Westover on his James River estates in Virginia, then a British colony. This is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the New <b>World.</b> <b>There</b> had not been any English colonisation of Australasia or southern Africa, where Test cricket is played now, by 1725. Australia and New Zealand had been partly explored by Abel Tasman in the 1640s but still had only their Aboriginal and Maori inhabitants respectively. The first European settlement in South Africa was founded on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established Cape Colony on Table Bay, near present-day Cape Town.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Baltic region of Livonia, people {{designated}} as werewolves went underground {{in the shape}} of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow {{at the end of the}} <b>world.</b> <b>There</b> they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the fight is not specified. The Circassians told that, on a certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz people, trying to suck each other's blood.|$|E
5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists. Domes standing alone represent Jesus.

One of her feathers – that of her memories of Syaoran – appears in Watanuki's world and gives the medium Kohane Tsuyuri the ability to exorcise spirits. After Kohane wishes for the removal of her ability, the feather stays with a black Mokona Modoki.

5|$|The Mycenaean pantheon already {{included}} many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, {{although it is}} difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed to them in later periods.
