5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide <b>waste.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E

50|$|At {{the expense}} of system simplicity, it is {{possible}} to improve efficiency by recirculation of power <b>wasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> termination resistance of unidirectional rhombics. Use of a recirculating termination system can move efficiency into the 70-80% range by combining power that would have been <b>wasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> termination with the transmitter power. Such systems bring a low-loss balanced line back from the termination end to the feedpoint through a matching and phasing system. Energy that would otherwise be dissipated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> termination resistance is applied in-phase with the excitation.|$|R

5|$|Coal mining {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed stopped. Strip mining was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal <b>waste</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal <b>waste</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
5|$|The {{single largest}} {{producer}} of food <b>waste</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom is the domestic household. In 2007, households created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste – accounting for 19 per cent of all municipal solid waste. Potatoes {{account for the}} largest quantity of avoidable food disposed of; 359,000 tonnes per year are thrown away, 49 per cent (177,400 tonnes) of which are untouched. Bread slices account for the second food type most disposed of (328,000 tonnes per year), and apples the third (190,000 tonnes per year). Salad is disposed of in the greatest proportion - 45 per cent of all salad purchased by weight will be thrown away uneaten.|$|E

5|$|The Brigantes {{were the}} major Celtic tribe {{in what is}} now known as Northern England; they had a stronghold in the {{locality}} at a sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands, opposite the banks of the River Irwell. Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now Salford and Stretford. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century, General Agricola ordered the construction of a fort named Mamucium in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) were protected from the Brigantes. Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time. A stabilised fragment of foundations of {{the final version of the}} Roman fort is visible in Castlefield. The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; its civilian settlement appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century. After the Roman withdrawal and Saxon conquest, the focus of settlement shifted to the confluence of the Irwell and Irk sometime before the arrival of the Normans after 1066. Much of the wider area was laid <b>waste</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subsequent Harrying of the North.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{industrial}} {{solid wastes}} mainly include mining tailings and industrial slags. Their typical applications in glass-ceramics are reviewed. The compositional {{design of the}} glass-ceramics based on the compositional features of wastes and the routes to increase <b>the</b> percentage of <b>wastes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass batches are emphasized. To increase the addition of industrial solid <b>wastes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass preparation {{is one of the}} key factors influencing the utilization of the wastes. One way to achieve this is to apply different wastes with compositional complementarity in glass batches. A few successful examples are summarized in this paper to provide good references for the further related research...|$|R
