40|$|The {{statistics}} of two-dimensional decaying turbulence are {{investigated by the}} use of direct, numerical simulation in a periodic box. A number of cases are systematically compared in which the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is solved on various resolutions and for various Reynolds numbers starting with random velocity fields of a prescribed energy spectrum. It is observed that the statistics are contaminated rapidly by the periodicity of the flow field which blocks the transfer of velocity fluctuations towards larger scales. At large Reynolds numbers the enstrophy spectrum decays similarly in time throughout the <b>whole</b> <b>wavenumber</b> range and the enstrophy decreases inversely proportionally to time...|$|E
40|$|A {{closed set}} of {{equations}} for the passive scalar correlation function in isotropic turbulence is formulated by the Lagrangian direct-interaction approximation developed previously {{by the present}} authors [Kida and Goto, J. Fluid Mech. 345, 307 (1997) ]. We examine the behavior of solutions to the resultant equations for arbitrary values of the Schmidt number, and show systematically that this closure theory is completely consistent with the phenomenological theories on the scalar spectrum function by Obukhov (1949), Corrsin (1951), Batchelor et al. (1959) and Batchelor (1959). The universal form of the function in the statistically stationary state is obtained by solving the closure equations numerically in the <b>whole</b> <b>wavenumber</b> range for each case of moderate, extremely large and small values of the Schmidt number. ...|$|E
40|$|Three models {{based on}} {{electro-optical}} parameters were {{tested for the}} calculation of the Raman intensities of the vibrational modes deduced from (molecular dynamics) calculations on four siliceous zeolites: sodalite, faujasite, zeolite A and silicalite. The best results {{were obtained from the}} electro-optical model containing three parameters: the derivatives of the longitudinal and transversal polarizabilities of the SiO bond with respect to the SiO bond length and the anisotropy of the polarizability tensor of the SiO bond. These parameters permit the reproduction of the relative intensities over the <b>whole</b> <b>wavenumber</b> range. The bond stretching range over 700 cm- 1 is driven by the first two parameters, whereas the equilibrium anisotropy participates significantly in the very low wavenumber region.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new «toy» {{dynamical}} model that permits us to derive analytical expressions for dispersion of two branches of «bare» propagating collective excitations in binary disordered {{systems in the}} <b>whole</b> range of <b>wavenumbers.</b> These expressions are used {{for the analysis of}} dependence of dispersion curves on mass ratio and concentration at fixed density of the system. An effect of hybridization of two branches is discussed in terms of mode contributions to time correlation functions. This allows us to estimate the regions with dominant types of coherent or partial dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Single-particle time {{correlation}} function F s (k,t) of pure fluids is studied within the generalized mode approach. Analytical expression for self-intermediate scattering function, which contains oscillating terms, is obtained for three-variable basis set of single-particle dynamic variables. The meaning of oscillating contributions is discussed, {{and it is}} shown, that in low-density fluids the oscillating contributions do not appear. Our approach, developed within the five-variable scheme, {{is used for the}} analysis of MD-derived single-particle time {{correlation function}} of Lennard-Jones fluid at two densities. It is shown, that the proposed scheme allows us to reproduce perfectly the function F s (k,t) at the <b>whole</b> range of <b>wavenumbers</b> k studied. The generalized self-diffusion coefficient as a function of k is also calculated...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} modeling {{with the}} diffusive controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) method {{has been used}} to validate the published results of Ellis et al. (2010 a) by first investigating the validity of effective medium theory for both horizontally layered isotropic and vertically transverse isotropic (VTI) layered earth. Ellis et al. (2010 a) used ’moving window average method’ to calculate bulk vertical and horizontal resistivities of resistivity logs, from which they calculated effective anisotropic ratio. The question is if the application of their local averaging scheme is valid also for a layered earth. The investigation of effective medium theory is done in horizontal wavenumber-frequency domain (k??) which allows us to evaluate the influence of propagation and attenuation parts of the complex vertical wavenumber on the existence and stability of the effective solution for the <b>whole</b> range of <b>wavenumber,</b> k. For the layered models considered, the total thickness is held constant while the number of layers is varied with consequent changes in thickness of the individual layer. Also, reflection and transmission interactions are both ignored and included. For the horizontally layered isotropic earth, with only propagation-diffusion term, a stable effective transverse electric (TE-mode) isotropic conductivity exists from 0. 5 % of maximum wavenumber irrespective of the unit thickness of a layer. But with the inclusion of reflection and transmission interactions, the effective skin depth or wavelength has to be sufficiently large compared with unit thickness of the layered earth for a stable solution to exist at all values of wavenumber, k. It is noted that effective transverse magnetic (TM-mode) isotropic conductivity {{is not the same as}} that of TE-mode for large wavenumber, k, because of the different limits of their reflection coefficients at large k. However, there are no effective vertically transverse isotropic (VTI) parameters which satisfy the horizontally layered isotropic or VTI layered earth because the effective VTI parameters are wavenumber, k-dependent, though with approximately constant effective anisotropic ratio. We conclude that the effective medium theory adopted by Ellis et al. (2010 a) is not a valid approach for modeling a layered earth, though it may be valid for a local measurement.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} Hamiltonian {{description of}} weakly nonlinear wave dynamics in unstable and nonequilibrium media. We construct the appropriate canonical {{variables in the}} <b>whole</b> <b>wavenumber</b> space. The essentially new element is the construction of canonical variables in a vicinity of marginally stable points where two normal modes coalesce. The commonly used normal variables are not appropriate in this domain. The mater is that the approximation of weak nonlinearity breaks down when the dynamical system is written in terms of these variables. In this case we introduce the canonical variables based on the linear combination of modes belonging to the two different branches of dispersion curve. As {{an example of one}} of the possible applications of presented results the evolution equations for weakly nonlinear wave packets in the marginally stable area are derived. These equations cannot be derived if we deal with the commonly used normal variables...|$|E
40|$|A {{perturbation}} method developed by Kraichnan [J. Fluid Mech. 5 (1959) 497], {{which is based}} upon an extraction of direct interactions among Fourier modes of a velocity field, {{is applied to the}} Lagrangian velocity correlation and response functions. The resultant set of integro-differential equations for these functions obtained for homogeneous isotropic turbulence, which has no adjustable free parameters, happens to be identical to the one derived before by using a different {{perturbation method}} [Kaneda, J. Fluid Mech. 107 (1981) 131]. The shape of the energy spectrum function is determined numerically in the universal range for stationary turbulence, and in the <b>whole</b> <b>wavenumber</b> range in a similarly evolving form for freely decaying case. The energy spectrum in the universal range takes same shape in the both cases, which also agrees excellently with many measurements of various kinds of real turbulence as well as numerical results obtained by Gotoh et al. [J. Phys. Soc. Japan, 57 (1988) 866] as an initial value problem. Skewness factor of the longitudinal velocity derivative is calculated to be - 0. 66 for stationary turbulence. Wavenumber dependence of the eddy-viscosity is also determined. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of microscale turbulent clustering of cloud droplets on the radar reflectivity factor and proposes a new parameterization to account for it. A three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of particle-laden isotropic turbulence is performed to obtain turbulent clustering data. The clustering data is then {{used to calculate the}} power spectra of droplet number density fluctuations, which show a dependence on the Taylor microscale-based Reynolds number (Re_λ) and the Stokes number (St). First, the Reynolds number dependency of the turbulent clustering influence is investigated for 127 < Re_λ < 531. The spectra for this wide range of Re_λ values reveal that Re_λ = 204 is sufficiently large to be representative of the <b>whole</b> <b>wavenumber</b> range relevant for radar observations of atmospheric clouds. The authors then investigate the Stokes number dependency for Re_λ = 204 and propose an empirical model for the turbulent clustering influence assuming power laws for the number density spectrum. For Stokes numbers less than 2, the proposed model can estimate {{the influence of}} turbulence on the spectrum with an RMS error less than 1 dB when calculated over the wavenumber range relevant for radar observations. For larger Stokes number droplets, the model estimate has larger errors, but the influence of turbulence is likely negligible in typical clouds. Applications of the proposed model to two idealized cloud observing scenarios reveal that microscale turbulent clustering can cause a significant error in estimating cloud droplet amounts from radar observations with microwave frequencies less than 13. 8 GHz...|$|E
40|$|Bypass {{transition}} {{has been}} studied by theoretical and numerical procedures, with the asymptotic suction boundary layer (ASBL) in focus. As reference cases the Blasius boundary layer (BBL) and a free shear flow have been studied. In order to reduce energy losses associated with flow systems, it is a wish to avoid turbulence in these flows. It is thus necessary to have a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind bypass transition, which typically starts with the formation and growth of structures extended in the streamwise direction, so called streaks. One way of delaying the transition to turbulence is to apply wall suction, which is also known to stabilize streaks. In this work, it is shown that the stabilizing mechanism of wall suction is not unambiguous. A theoretical study on the linear evolution of streaks triggered by a localized disturbance is performed. Releasing the disturbance in the free-stream, it will migrate towards the wall and quickly be subject to shear. Consequently, this disturbance is amplified when applying wall suction, provided that for the suction-free case {{the growth of the}} BBL may be considered small. When initiating the disturbance inside the boundary layer, on the other hand, it is found that suction stabilizes the growth of such a streak. Also, the non-linear properties of suction are studied using a model with prescribed wall-normal disturbance velocity identical for the ASBL and the BBL. Despite the similarity, suction is shown to dampen the non-linear forcing of the perturbation. Moreover, the non-linear response is shown to favor the forcing of streamwise longitudinal (3 D) structures and 2 D waves. For the ASBL, also energy thresholds for transition of periodical disturbances have been determined by direct numerical simulations. The least energy required to reach transition is obtained when the initial flow field consists of two oblique waves, for which the threshold value is found to scale as Re^{- 2. 6 }. For transition starting with streamwise vortices or random noise the threshold scales like Re^{- 2. 1 } (Re being the Reynolds number), and the routes to transition are similar to that of other flows. A theoretical framework for evaluating the non-linear interaction terms of the normal- velocity/vorticity equations is also developed. This formulation allows for study of wave interaction throughout the <b>whole</b> <b>wavenumber</b> plane, i. e. for any given wave number of a disturbance. The framework has been applied to a free shear flow, which shows that primarily streamwise elongated structures and Tollmien-Schlichting waves are forced by the non-linear interactions. Besides that, the geometrical interpretation shows that the non-linear interaction involving normal vorticity is most potent for structures inter-angled by 90 degrees in the wavenumber plane.
