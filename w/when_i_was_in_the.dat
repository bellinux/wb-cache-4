2500|$|... "Take Everything", {{another song}} {{recorded}} for the album, {{is one of}} several songs written by Love and produced by Jim Jonsin and was the first record that Rowland recorded with the duo.

I told Rico I wanted something really sexy ... and he came up with 'Motivation' along with Jim. It turned into this amazing record... I played [...] and he got on it, and it was just as simple as that." [...] The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body, and are accompanied by a [...] "synth-saturated beat" [...] produced by Jonsin. In terms of instruments, [...] "Motivation" [...] uses sparse keyboard notes, programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus. Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland's seductive suggestions, using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex.|$|E

Frank Ocean will say it. Miguel will say it." [...] Barbadian singer Rihanna revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that her 2007 multi-platinum album, Good Girl Gone Bad, was primarily influenced by Afrodisiac. In the interview she stated, [...] "Brandy's album really helped to inspire, because that album I listen to all day, all night <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio [...] I really admired that every song was a great song." [...] Rock musician John Frusciante, viruoso guitarist of the popular rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, mentioned that Norwood and the album were the “main inspiration” behind the guitar work on the Red Hot Chili Pepper’s 2006 Grammy winning album, Stadium Arcadium.

[...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like I drop mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E

30|$|It can {{be noticed}} that the values of m(i) are {{influenced}} by the position of i in the topology. In particular, nodes that are close to the periphery will have larger values compared to nodes that <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the center of the topology. This can be explained noting that <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the periphery of the network, its average distance from the other nodes <b>is</b> larger than <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the center, so m(i) is higher on the periphery. It is also easy to see that in this simple topology, if we compute t(i) excluding the packets that <b>are</b> generated by <b>i</b> itself, t(i) <b>is</b> constant. This would make the ratio t(i)/m(i) decrease for nodes close to the extreme ends of the network. In the figure, instead, we plot t(i) including also the packets generated by node i, which increases the values of t(i) on the periphery. This takes into account that in our scenario, each node is a gateway for its own subnet, so the first hop <b>is</b> counted <b>in</b> its own subnet. Even in this case, t(i)/m(i) is still larger for nodes that <b>are</b> central <b>in</b> the topology.|$|R
