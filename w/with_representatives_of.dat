5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming.

With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.|$|E

Without asking permission from Schuyler, he moved 1,200 men north on the schooner Liberty and the sloop Enterprise. Montgomery wrote a letter to Schuyler, explaining the situation.|$|E

On 15 April 1942 the Wehrmacht commander in south-east Europe, Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Wilhelm List, issued an order forbidding Wehrmacht units to negotiate with any rebel groups. Only Abwehr (military intelligence) and police units were to maintain surveillance of such groups through informants and undercover agents.|$|E
5|$|The Parliamentary Army garrisoned {{the town}} upon the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 and established their headquarters there in June 1647 on a line from Staines to Watford, although the king passed through Uxbridge in April 1646, resting at the Red Lion public house for several hours. Charles I met <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> Parliament at the Crown Inn in Uxbridge in 1645, but negotiations for the end of hostilities were unsuccessful {{due in part to the}} king's stubborn attitude. The town had been chosen as it was located between the Royal headquarters at Oxford and the Parliamentary stronghold of London.|$|E

5|$|The first Ambassador of Russia to Austria was Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn and {{he served}} in this {{position}} from 1763 until 1792. Gallitzinstraße, the street where his ambassadorial villa was located is named after him. In 1792 Count Andrey Kirillovich Razumovsky became ambassador in Vienna, where he kept contact <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the European aristocracy, politicians and artists. While in Vienna, he built the Palais Rasumofsky, and also financed construction of a stone bridge across the Danube. As a patron of the arts, Razumovsky established an art gallery, and commissioned Beethoven to compose the famous Razumovsky string quartets.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval {{was no longer a}} key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|Before 1948, Haifa's Municipality {{was fairly}} unusual as it {{developed}} {{cooperation between the}} mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city, <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> both groups involved in the city's management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the city council had six Arab and two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under Hasan Bey Shukri, who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality. In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, Shabtai Levy, was elected. Levy's two deputies were Arab (one Muslim, the other Christian), with {{the remainder of the}} council made up of four Jews and six Arabs.|$|E

5|$|Bormann's {{power and}} {{effective}} reach broadened considerably during the war. By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the State, the army, and the Party {{in an attempt}} to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance.|$|E
