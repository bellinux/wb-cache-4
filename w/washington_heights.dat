5|$|Ramirez {{was born}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Aristides and Onelcida Ramirez and spent {{thirteen}} years living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers {{to be one of}} his most prized possessions. In 1985, he moved to the <b>Washington</b> <b>Heights</b> neighborhood of New York City with his parents. He would often play ball at the nearby Snake Hill, the same place Lou Gehrig played during his childhood. Despite living just a short distance from Yankee Stadium, Ramirez rooted for the Toronto Blue Jays and would watch games when the Blue Jays were in town.|$|E

5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it had asked the city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the <b>Washington</b> <b>Heights</b> express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E
