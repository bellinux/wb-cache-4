40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to examine the {{modifications}} occurring in certain functional hydration properties (protein solubility in 0. 5 M acetic acid, apparent viscosity and <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity)</b> of the collagenous material from skin and muscle of hake (Merluccius merluccius L.) in relation to the pH and the ionic strength (expressed as variation in NaCl concentration) of the medium. At the same time, these modifications were compared with those reported for collagenous material from trout in a previous paper. Generally speaking, skin collagenous material showed higher functionality than muscle collagenous material. It was found that protein solubility, apparent viscosity and <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> presented maximum values at pH levels between 2 and 4, and at concentrations of less than 0. 25 M NaCl. Finally, the functional values were found to be higher in collagenous material from hake than from trout, especially in the skin material. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Chia (Salvia hispanica L.) {{constitutes}} a potential alternative raw material and ingredient in food industry applications {{due to its}} dietary fiber content. Gum can be extracted from its dietary fiber fractions for use as an additive to control viscosity, stability, texture, and consistency in food systems. The gum extracted from chia seeds was characterized to determine their quality and potential as functional food additives. The extracted chia gum contained 26. 2 % fat and a portion was submitted to fat extraction, producing two fractions: gum with fat (FCG) and gum partly defatted (PDCG). Proximal composition and physicochemical characterization showed these fractions to be different (P< 0. 05). The PDCG had higher protein, ash, and carbohydrates content than the FCG, in addition to higher water-holding (110. 5 [*]g water/g fiber) and <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacities</b> (0. 84 [*]g water/g fiber). The FCG had greater oil-holding capacity (25. 7 [*]g oil/g fiber) and water absorption capacity (44 [*]g water/g fiber). In dispersion trials, the gums exhibited a non-Newtonian fluid behavior, specifically shear thinning or pseudoplastic type. PDCG had more viscosity than FCG.

40|$|Collagen is {{a natural}} {{biomaterial}} with excellent biocompatibility. However, unprocessed collagen has low stability and weak mechanical strength, which limits its application in tissue engineering. The current study aimed to improve the physicochemical properties of collagen scaffolds by using photochemical crosslinking. Collagen gel was reconstituted and photochemically crosslinked by using laser irradiation {{in the presence of}} a photosensitizer. Scanning electron microscope was used to characterize the surface and cross-sectional morphology. Stress-strain relationship and other mechanical properties were determined by uniaxial tensile tests. Thermostability and <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacities</b> also were analyzed by using differential scanning calorimetry and swelling ratio measurements, respectively. Photochemically crosslinked porous structures showed fine microstructure with interconnected micron-sized pores, whereas uncrosslinked controls only showed macrosheet-like structures. The stabilizing effect of photochemical crosslinking also was revealed by retaining the three-dimensional lamellae-like structures after thermal analysis in crosslinked membranes but not in the controls. Photochemical crosslinking also significantly reduced the swelling ratio, improved the stress-strain relationship, peak load, ultimate stress, rupture strain, and tangent modulus of collagen membranes. The current study showed that an innovative photochemical crosslinking process was able to produce collagen scaffolds with fine microstructures; to strengthen, stiffen, and stabilize collagen membranes; and to modify their swelling ratio. This may broaden the use of collagen-based scaffolds in tissue engineering, particularly for weight-bearing tissues. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacities</b> (WBCs) of {{pea protein}} isolate, soy protein isolate, lupin protein {{concentrate}} and {{vital wheat gluten}} particles were investigated by hydrating them in excess water, centrifuging these dispersions, and calculating the WBCs from {{the weight of the}} pellets. It was found that, except for pea proteins, the pellet consisted of a notable amount of interstitial water. Furthermore, it seems that when particles were largely deformable a (semi-) continuous protein network was formed in which individual particles could not be distinguished anymore. Then, the WBC of the pellet did not represent the WBC of the original particles anymore. Consequently, it was concluded that the WBC of the pellet (WBC-P) differs from the WBC of the particles. Therefore, the characteristics of the particles and their pellets were further investigated with, among others, time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD NMR). TD NMR {{turned out to be a}} useful additional tool to do this, and has the potential to give an indication of the amount of water present in each water domain. From the information obtained about the characteristics of the particles and their pellets, it could be concluded that variations in the WBC-P were the result of differences in the deformability of the particles (i. e., their capability to swell and to withstand the centrifugal force), and their ability to bind water interstitially. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} little {{understanding of the}} physicochemical properties in the human gastrointestinal tract of Australian sweet lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) kernel fibre (LKF), a novel food ingredient with potential for the fibre enrichment of foods such as baked goods. Since physicochemical properties of dietary fibres have been related to beneficial physiological effects in vitro, this study compared <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> and viscosity of LKF with that of other fibres currently used for fibre-enrichment of baked goods, under in vitro conditions simulating the human upper gastrointestinal tract. At between 8. 47 and 11. 07 g water/g dry solids, LKF exhibited water-binding capacities that were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than soy fibre, pea hull fibre, cellulose and wheat fibre {{at all of the}} simulated gastrointestinal stages examined. Similarly, viscosity of LKF was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than that of the other fibres at all simulated gastrointestinal stages. The relatively high <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> and viscosity of LKF identified in this study suggests that this novel fibre ingredient may elicit different and possibly more beneficial physiological effects in the upper human gastrointestinal tract than the conventional fibre ingredients currently used in fibre-enriched baked goods manufacture.

40|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) allows flexibility to the vertebral column, and transfers the predominant axial loads during daily activities. Its axial biomechanical behaviour is poroelastic, {{due to the}} <b>water-binding</b> and releasing <b>capacity</b> of the nucleus pulposus. Degeneration of the {{intervertebral disc}} presumably affects both the instantaneous elastic response to the load on the IVD and the subsequent interstitial flow of fluid. This study aims to quantify the poroelastic behaviour of the IVD and its change with degeneration, {{as defined by the}} magnetic resonance imaging-based Pfirrmann Score (PS). For a period of ten days, 36 human lumbar IVDs were loaded with a simulated physiological axial loading regime, while deformation was monitored. The IVDs responded to the loads with instantaneous elastic and slow poroelastic axial deformation. Several mechanical parameters changed throughout the first five days of the experiment, until the IVDs settled into a dynamic equilibrium. In this equilibrium, degeneration was significantly related to a decrease in disc height loss during the daytime high load phase (ρ = - 0. 49), and to a decrease in the rate of this deformation during the final half hour of each day (ρ = - 0. 53). These properties were related to the nucleus glycosaminoglycan/hydroxyproline (GAG/HYP) ratio, rather than GAG content alone, indicating that remodelling of the extracellular matrix reduces poroelastic properties of the IVD. This implies that the degenerated discs have a reduced capacity to bind water and/or a reduced resistance against fluid flow. The resulting loss in hydrostatic pressure may further change cell behaviour in the nucleus pulposu...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} salt {{addition}} and three postmortem holding {{times on the}} pH, water binding, and emulsifying capacities of broiler and hen breast and leg meat were determined. Broilers and hens were processed in a pilot plant; the skinless meat was stripped from uneviscerated, non-chilled carcasses; and initial pH values of breast and thigh muscles were made within 20 min postmortem. The four sublots of ground meat — breast without salt, breast with salt, leg without salt, and leg with salt — were held at 2 C, and samples were drawn at 1. 5, 4, or 24 hr postmor-tem. Initial broiler breast muscle pH was lower than hen breast muscle, and breast muscle pH was lower than leg muscle pH for both classses. There were only small pH differences noted for the holding times. Salt addition significantly elevated the pH of breast meat but not of leg meat. Salt significantly improved the <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> of both meat types with the most pronounced increase noted for hen leg meat.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research were {{to examine the effects}} of high dietary levels of fibrous feeds, and of supplementation with Roxazyme® G 2 (RX), on the digestive metabolic and physiological responses of growing pigs fed maize-soybean diets. The nutrient and dietary fibre (DF) composition, the swelling and <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacities</b> of maize (MM), its hominy chop (HC) and cobs (MC), dehulled soybean (dSBM) and the hulls (SH), brewer’s grains (BG), lucerne hay (LH) and wheat bran (WB) were evaluated using standard procedures. Feed fibre fractions were isolated by simulating upper tract digestion in an Ankom® DaisyII Incubator, whereby each feed was digested in pepsin (porcine, 200 FIP-U/g, Merck No, 7190), followed by pancreatin (porcine, grade IV, Sigma No P- 1750), with recovery of the fibrous residues. In a third step to complete the simulated pig gastro-intestinal digestion, the pepsin-pancreatin fibre extracts were digested by RX or Viscozyme L ® V 2010 (VZ). Enzyme activity was measured as the coefficients of partial degradability (solubilisation) of the washed fibre extracts. The kinetics and products of fermentation of the DF were evaluated in an AnkomRF gas production system, using buffered faecal inoculum. Among the feed ingredients, dissimilar, fibre source-dependent activities between RX (0. 02 to 0. 12) and VZ (0. 04 - 0. 33) were observed. The lowest RX activities were observed on the maize and soybean derived fibres, with similarly low VZ activity on MC fibre. Variation in the activity of faecal microbial enzymes was similarly indicated by the variable production of fermentation gas (51. 8 - 299. 4 mL g- 1 DM) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) (2. 3 - 6. 0 mMol g- 1 DM). Soy hull, dSBH, MM and HC fibres were highly fermentable, with low fermentability of BG, MC and WB fibres. The fibres differed in the composition of fermentation SCFA, whereby SH, LH and MC shifted fermentation to Ace, and BG, dSBM, WB, MM, HC favoured Pro, while MM and HC favoured But production. The same nutritional properties were similarly evaluated in complete diets which were formulated from the ingredients for growth, and metabolic trials. For the growth trial, a standard (STD) (control), 141 g total dietary fibre (TDF) kg- 1 dry matter (DM) maize-soybean growing pig diet, and five iso-nutritive, 246 g TDF kg- 1 DM nutritionally balanced diets were formulated. The high DF was achieved by partial replacement of the MM and dSBM in the STD diet with MC, SH, BG, LH or WB. The differences in RX and VZ activities and in the fermentation characteristics which were observed on the fibre extracts from the high fibre ingredients were reflected in the DF from the respective complete diets in which they were included. However, the fibre from the basal dietary ingredients reduced the absolute values and the variation in the activities of RX (0. 03 - 0. 06) and VZ (0. 16 - 0. 22), and similarly reduced the variation in gas (126. 6 - 187. 6 mL g- 1 DM) and SCFA (4. 1 - 5. 4 mMol g- 1 DM) production of the DF from the fibrous diets. Enzyme activities on the STD DF were low for RX (0. 03) and high for VZ (0. 25). The STD DF produced 205. 3 mL gas g- 1 DM, which was similar to SH DF, and higher than all the other diets. The STD DF produced 5. 0 -mMol SCFA g- 1 DM, which was quantitatively, and not statistically higher than the other fibres. The composition of SCFA was similar across all diets, except for the high percent Ace, with low Pro by the SH DF. Compared to the STD, the high DF diets increased percent Ace, with reduced Pro and But. The STD, MC, SH, BG, LH and WB diets were each prepared in duplicate mixes, one of which was fortified with 200 mg RX kg- 1 feed (as fed). Seventy-two intact Large White X Landrace, male, 32. 0 ± 5. 6 kg live weight (LW) pigs were allocated to the diets in two completely randomised weight blocks in a 2 (fibre source) X 2 (enzyme) factorial arrangement. The pigs were fed ad libitum for 10 weeks. Cumulative LW gain and feed intake were measured at different stages of growth, and at slaughter. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients was estimated at 65 - 70 kg LW, using 0. 2 % (as fed) chromium oxide as the indigestible marker. Ileal tissue was sampled 50 cm above the ileo-caecal valve, on which villi height and area, and crypt depth were evaluated by computerised image analysis. Blood was sampled at slaughter from the severed vena jugularis, 16 hours after feeding. Serum urea, creatinine, triglycerides, glucose, and total cholesterol were analysed chemically. The serum metabolome was further explored using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1 H -NMRS). There was fibre X RX interaction for villi height, whereby the enzyme reduced the villi height in pigs on the SH, STD and WB diets, with an opposite effect on pigs on the MC, BG, LH diets. The soluble fibre content was negatively correlated with crypt depth. Chemical analysis did not detect differences in metabolite concentration between the STD and the high fibre diets. However, more serum cholesterol was observed in pigs fed the WB compared to the LH and MC diets. 1 H-NMRS indicated that feeding pigs the WB diet increased serum Cys and His, while supplementation of RX increased serum formate, glucose, and urea. There was diet X enzyme interaction for fructose, glucose, Arg, Cys, Ser, and Trp, whereby RX increased the levels in pigs on MC and WB, with an opposite effect in pigs on the other diets. There was large DF source-dependent variation among diets in ATTD of DM (0. 80 - 0. 85), organic matter (OM) (0. 81 - 0. 87), gross energy (GE) (079 - 0. 85) and CP (0. 81 - 0. 85), whereby, relative to the STD diet, high DF reduced the ATTD of DM (all diets except SH), organic matter (OM) and energy and CP (all diets except the MC). Positive correlation was observed between fermentability and the ATTD digestibility of DM, OM, energy, ADF, NDF, and fat. Negative correlation was observed between the swelling capacity and the ATTD of DM, OM, energy and protein, between DF solubility and DM, OM, protein, ADF and NDF, and between water binding capacity and ATTD of DM and OM, energy and NDF. At slaughter, there was similarly large, and DF source-dependent variation among the high fibre diets in feed intake (2. 31 - 2. 71 kg as fed day- 1), live weight gain (0. 75 - 0. 86 kg day- 1), and feed: gain ratio (2. 73 - 3. 00). Corresponding values for the STD diet were 2. 44 kg day- 1, 0. 83 kg day- 1 and 2. 86 kg day- 1, respectively. Relative to the STD, LH reduced feed intake and live weight gain, and MC increased the feed: gain ratio. Predictions based on the in vitro fermentability of DF and feed intake suggested that due to poor fermentability, and or restriction of feed intake, relative to a standard fibre diet, high dietary levels of MC, WB and BG may reduce fermentation in the lower gut, while similar dietary levels of SH and LH may result in substantial increases in fermentation. At 50 kg LW, the fermentability of DF was positively correlated with feed intake and with weight gain, while water binding capacity and solubility of DF were negatively correlated with feed intake. At slaughter, the solubility of DF was negatively correlated with feed intake and feed: gain ratio. Large variation among the high fibre diets was also observed in the slaughter weight (89. 2 - 96. 8 kg), dressing % (68. 6 - 76. 4), meat colour (80. 4 - 82. 3), lean % (69. 5 - 71. 2), and fat % (10. 1 - 12. 6). In comparison, pigs on the STD diet scored 94. 7 kg slaughter weight, 75. 1 % dressing, 81. 6 cm carcass length, 82. 5 meat colour, 68. 4 % lean, and 15. 0 % fat. Relative to the STD, LH reduced dressing and fat %. Lucerne hay and WB increased the lean%. For the metabolic trial, two iso-nutritive, mixed high fibre (319 g TDF kg- 1 DM), nutritionally balanced diets were formulated to contain DF of high (HF) versus low (LF) fermentability. The diets had similar content of soluble DF and similar swelling and water binding capacities. Viscozyme was more active than RX on both the HF (0. 20 versus 0. 04) and the LF (0. 17 versus 0. 07) DF. The combination of RX and VZ statistically increased the enzyme activity on the HF (0. 25) and quantitatively increased enzyme activity on the LF (0. 18) DF, suggesting additive or synergistic effects. More gas was produced by the HF (159. 5 mL g- 1 DM) compared to the LF DF (96. 6 mL g- 1 DM). More SCFA were produced by HF (5. 0 mMol g- 1 DM), compared to the LF DF (3. 6 mMol g- 1 DM). Compared to the STD, HF DF increased percent Ace, with reduced Pro and But. The LF DF increased percent Ace, with quantitative, and not statistical reduction of Pro and But. In a metabolic trial, the HF and LF diets, and their duplicates containing 0. 270 g RX kg- 1 DM of feed (as fed) were fed ad libitum to eight ileum T-cannulised, intact Large White X Landrace male pigs weighing 65. 0 ± 5. 1 kg. The diets were allocated to the pigs in a duplicate 4 x 4 Latin Square design, in a 2 (enzyme) x 2 (fermentability) factorial arrangement. Each period consisted of two weeks of adaptation followed by five days of sampling. The ileal digesta was collected in each period and was similarly subjected to the fermentation test. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and ATTD were determined using 0. 2 % (as fed) chromium oxide as the indigestible marker. N excretion in faeces and urine were measured, and N retention was calculated. Blood was sampled by vena jugularis puncture on the last day of each period. Two blood samples were collected, the first 15 hours after removal from feed (15 -hour serum), and the second 3 hours after re-introduction to feed (3 -hour serum). Serum metabolites were evaluated by both chemical analyses and by 1 H-NMRS, as described for the growth trial. Roxazyme did not affect the fermentation characteristics of the ileal digesta. In similar proportion to the fermentability of the PP digesta, the HF ileal digesta was more fermentable (65. 4 mL gas g- 1 DM and 6. 1 mMol SCFA g- 1 DM) than the LF ileal digesta (46. 7 mL gas g- 1 DM and 4. 4 mMol SCFA g- 1 DM SCFA). Prediction based on the in vitro fermentability of DF and feed intake suggested the HF diet could support one half times more fermentation in the lower gut compared to the LF diet. The HF diet had higher AID of DM (62. 5 vs. 58. 6), OM (65. 6 vs. 62. 1), energy (64. 4 vs. 61. 0), fat (85. 8 vs. 81. 7) and ash (41. 8 vs. 32. 7). The AID of HO-Pro, Met and Val were higher for the LF diet. There was diet X enzyme interaction on the AID of Met, whereby the RX reduced the AID of met in the LF diet, and not that of the HF diet. The ATTD was higher for the HF diet for DM (74. 2 vs. 68. 4), NDF (64. 7 vs. 57. 4), and ADF (35. 1 vs. 21. 0). There was positive correlation between the fermentability of DF and the AID DM, OM, ash, ash, fat and energy. The solubility of DF was negatively correlated with the AID of DM, OM, ash, fat, ADF and energy, and with the ATTD of DM, OM, ash, fat, energy, NDF, and ADF. Negative correlation was also observed between the swelling capacity of DF and the AID of protein, Trp and Lys. The solubility of DF was positively correlated with Ser, Ala, Val, Iso-Leu and His. There was diet X enzyme interaction for urea in the 15 - hour serum, whereby RX tended to reduce the urea in the LF diet, while it increased that of the HF diet. Fermentability negatively correlated with urea in the 15 - hour serum, and positively correlated with serum glucose in the 3 -hour serum. In the 3 -hour sample, 1 H-NMRS indicated higher fucose, Pro and cholesterol in the LF diet. 1 H-NMRS also indicated fermentability x RX interaction for Ser, Tyr, Lys, creatine, and possibly, glucose or fructose, glycerol or Gly and His or Arg, whereby RX increased the levels in the LF diets, with opposite effect in the HF diet. In conclusion, enzyme activities and fermentability were higly variable among different DF sources, and the effects were evident in the fibrous complete diets. The results of the in vitro studies supported the application of the methods to formulate fermentable insoluble fibre-rich, maize-soybean-mixed co-product diets. Correlation analyses suggested that DF fermentability, and solubility, swelling and water binding capacities explained significant proportions of the variances of the metabolic and physiological responses of the pigs to different feeds. Predictions based on the in vitro fermentability of DF and feed intake suggested that a strategy whereby pig diets are enriched in DF after the feedstuffs are screened on DF fermentability could substantially increase fermentation in the lower gut. Overall, the results suggested that productivity can be maintained in growing pigs fed diets containing up to twice the standard levels of DF, provided producers target co-product feeds that contain highly fermentable DF. The use of RX to improve nutrient digestion and to stimulate gut fermentation was not justified. Environmental SciencesPh. D. (Environmental Sciences...|$|R
40|$|Collagen gel is {{a natural}} {{biomaterial}} commonly used in tissue engineering because of its close resemblance to nature, negligible immunogenecity and excellent biocompatibility. However, unprocessed collagen gel is mechanically weak, highly water binding and vulnerable to chemical and enzymatic attacks that limits its use in tissue engineering in particular tissues for weight-bearing purposes. The current project aimed to strengthen and stabilize collagen scaffolds using a photochemical crosslinking technique. Photochemical crosslinking is rapid, efficient, non-thermal and does not involve toxic chemicals, comparing with other crosslinking methods such as glutaraldehyde and gamma irradiation. Collagen scaffolds were fabricated using rat-tail tendon collagen. An argon laser was used to process the collagen gel after equilibrating with a photosensitizing reagent. Scanning electronic microscope was used to characterize the surface and cross-sectional morphology of the membranes. Physico-chemical properties of the collagen scaffolds such as <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity,</b> mechanical properties and thermostability were studied. Photochemical crosslinking significantly reduced the <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity,</b> a parameter inversely proportional {{to the extent of}} crosslinking, of collagen scaffolds. Photochemical crosslinking also significantly increased the ultimate stress and tangent modulus at 90 % of the rupture strain of the collagen scaffolds. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis showed a significantly higher shrinkage temperature and absence of the denaturation peak during the thermoscan comparing with the controls. This means greater thermostability in the photochemically crosslinked collagen scaffolds. This study demonstrates that the photochemical crosslinking technology is able to enhance the physicochemical properties of collagen scaffolds by strengthening, stabilizing and controlling the swelling ratio of the collagen scaffolds so as to enable their use for tissue engineering. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

As a polyanionic molecule with high <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity,</b> PSA increases the intercellular space generating permissive conditions for cell motility. PSA enhances stem cell migration and axon path finding and promotes repair in the lesioned peripheral and central nervous systems, thus contributing to regeneration. As a next step in developing an improved PSA-based approach to treat nervous system injuries, we searched for small organic compounds that mimic PSA and identified as a PSA mimetic 5 -nonyloxytryptamine oxalate, described as a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor 1 B (5 -HT 1 B) agonist.

30|$|The lowest expressible drip {{was found}} in kamaboko gels, both K 40 and K 25 (p[*]<[*] 0.05), {{indicating}} the highest water holding capacity (Table 1). Modori gel and directly heated gel had the highest expressible drip (p[*]<[*] 0.05), suggesting that protein network of the gel was lower in <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> (Niwa [1992]). Generally, the lowered expressible moisture content was {{in accordance with the}} increased breaking force (Figure 1 a). During direct heating, rapid unfolding of proteins possibly resulted in more intense coagulation. More water was released from the gel network, and the protein dispersion becomes very uneven (Niwa [1992]). Benjakul et al. ([2010]) also reported that kamaboko gel from goatfish surimi showed the higher water holding capacity than modori gel. Therefore, the improved water holding capacity of yellow stripe trevally surimi gel could be achieved via appropriate setting prior to heating.|$|E
40|$|Pea fiber {{concentrate}} (PFC) {{and wheat}} fiber concentrate (WFC) {{were used as}} dietary fibers in beef burger formulation. These fibers were characterized in terms of chemical composition and techno-functional properties. WFC and PFC presented similar <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> (3. 12 g/g and 3. 07 g/g, respectively), whereas a higher oil-binding capacity was observed for WFC (2. 89 g/g versus 1. 74 g/g). In this study, the level of PFC was fixed at 0. 5 %, whereas different levels of WFC (0. 5 %, 1 % and 1. 5 %) were tested. The water-holding capacity of raw beef burger was significantly higher {{with the addition of}} fibers. The use of these dietary fibers in beef burger formulation improves their cooking properties, i. e., increases the cooking yield and decreases the shrinkage, and minimizes production cost without degradation of sensory properties.

Next, these pretreated samples were in vitro digested and fermented, {{with or without the}} addition of commercial pectinolytic enzymes. Remaining carbohydrates were quantified, and two physical characteristics were analyzed: (1) <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> (WBC) of the insoluble residue and (2) viscosity of the soluble fraction. Mild acid pretreatment in combination with commercial pectinolytic enzyme mixtures showed best digestion of RSM carbohydrates; only 32 % of the total carbohydrate content remained. For most pretreatments, addition of commercial pectinolytic enzymes had the strongest effect on lowering the WBC of the in vitro incubated RSM.

For example, protein derived from lobster head meats has been shown to have excellent wettability, high solubility, and emulsification (Vieira et al. 1995). Solubility of lobster shell protein (LSP) recovered either by aqueous extraction or enzymatic digestion was over 93 %, which is independent of the pH value and the ionic strength of the solution used (Nguyen et al. 2016; Oviedo et al. 1982). High water binding of LSP was also reported by the fact that beef mince when added with 2 % of LSP resulted in its <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> being 2.5 times higher than that when added with egg white protein (Nguyen et al. 2016).

When a dispersion is being analyzed, here containing whey protein microparticles (MPs), the pellet consists of swollen particles and water between the particles. These two water domains in MP pellets were distinguished using time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD NMR). This distinction showed that an increase in WBC from 2 to 5. 5 g water/g dry matter was mainly due {{to an increase in}} water between the MPs. Besides, it was found that TD NMR-measurements could be used to provide accurate values of the amount of water in both water domains in MP pellets. This makes TD NMR therefore a more accurate method to determine the WBC of the whole pellet than weighing the pellet after centrifugation. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the nutritional value of salmon caviar and that of Pacific herring has been conducted showing that the herring caviar nutritional value is not inferior to the salmon one. One of the directions of processing caviar raw materials is the production of pasty products: pates, spreads, pastes, sauces, creams and oils. The successful development of such products using caviar raw materials is only possible by conducting regular analysis of food values, the study of structuring and emulsifying properties, which are currently not sufficiently studied. The functional and technological properties of Pacific herring have been investigated: <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> (WBC), water-holding capacity (WHC), emulsifying capacity (EC) etc. It has been experimentally established that the stability of emulsion systems from Pacific herring caviar affects the type of pretreatment of raw materials.

40|$|The {{ability of}} whey protein microparticles (MPs) to bind water and {{consequently}} to swell is, amongst others, {{determined by the}} crosslink density of the MPs. The Flory-Rehner model states that a decrease in crosslink density should lead to an increased swelling of the MPs. Decreasing the crosslink density of MPs with dithiothreitol (DTT) decreased the amount of disulphide bridges and increased the <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> (WBC) from 6 to 9 g water/g protein. Increasing the crosslink density with transglutaminase or genipin resulted in a decreased number of primary amino groups, although the WBC did not change significantly. The WBC of the MPs was determined using a centrifugation method {{that resulted in the}} formation of a pellet, so water inside and between the MPs was measured simultaneously. Therefore, additional microscopy and swelling tests were performed, which suggested that an increased WBC of the pellet of MPs was not only related to an increased swelling of the MPs, but also to an increased amount of water between the MPs...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{costs for}} wheat imports due to higher demand for wheat-based food {{products}} in many tropical developing {{countries such as}} Ghana {{has led to an}} interest in cassava flour as partial substitute for wheat flour in bakery products. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize physico-chemical properties of cassava flour compared to wheat flour and determine its maximum acceptable substitution level in composite wheat/cassava bread and cakes in terms of baking and organoleptical characteristics. Flours from three different local varieties of cassava (Afisiafi, Bankye hemmaa and Doku Duade) were compared. Cassava roots were processed into flour by grating, sun-drying and milling. Quality parameters such as moisture and starch content and acidity as well as functional properties in water such as pasting characteristics, swelling power and <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> were determined. Breads and cakes including 10, 20 and 30 % cassava flour were baked and evaluated for specific volume, density and hardness. The products were submitted to a semi-trained panel of Ghanaian urban consumers for sensory analysis. Flour yield from processing of three varieties of cassava roots into flour ranged from 18 to 19. 9 %. Swelling power ranged from 10. 5 to 12, swelling volume from 8. 6 ml to 11 ml, solubility from 11 % to 20. 8 % and <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> from 152 % to 166. 9 %, higher values than for wheat flour. This could be explained by a higher starch content in cassava flour that ranged from 87. 8 to 89. 2 % on dry matter basis. Cassava flours were characterized by an early gelatinization (pasting temperature between 70 and 71 °C), high peak viscosity, large paste breakdown and low retrogradation tendency compared to wheat flour. As the substitution level increased in wheat/cassava bread, loaf specific volume decreased and density and hardness increased. Breads baked with 10 % and 20 % cassava flour were accepted by the sensory panel in terms of appearance, taste and texture and up to 30 % was accepted in cakes. These results showed that High Quality Cassava Flour has potential to replace part of the wheat flour in bakery products since there is a wide acceptance among consumers...|$|E
40|$|Main {{constituents}} of skeletal muscle are water, protein, fat, carbohydrate and other soluble compounds. The {{amount of water}} is usually found in the range 70 – 80 %. Part of this water is found in free form while the rest is bound to proteins, especially myofibrillar proteins, through charged and polar groups. The amount of immobilised water depends on the available space within the myofibrillar structure and, in fact, the volume of myofibrils is decisive to the <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> of the muscle. Some variations exist between muscles due to the types of muscle fibres, degree of fibre contraction and pre-rigor pH. The water retention will also depend on the ultimate pH reached after rigor mortis and this will have a strong influence on the activity of muscle enzymes involved in proteolysis and lipolysis during ageing and further processing. Variations may be also expected between animal or fish species and age at slaughter.

This review {{focuses on the}} nutritional value, health benefits, and technological effects of incorporating lupin flour into wheat-based bread. Results of clinical studies suggest that consuming lupin compared to wheat bread and other baked products reduce chronic disease risk markers; possibly due to increased protein and dietary fiber and bioactive compounds. However, lupin protein allergy has also been recorded. Bread quality has been improved when 10 % lupin flour is substituted for refined wheat flour; possibly due to lupin-wheat protein cross-linking assisting bread volume and the high <b>water-binding</b> <b>capacity</b> (WBC) of lupin fiber delaying staling. Above 10 % substitution appears to reduce bread quality due to lupin proteins low elasticity and the high WBC of its dietary fiber interrupting gluten network development.
