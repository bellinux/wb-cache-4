5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E

25|$|Jim Walcott (Peter Keleghan) is City Hour {{similarly}} shallow but {{far less}} intelligent anchorman.

25|$|The Surfer's {{board is}} {{composed}} of a nearly impervious, cosmically powered silvery material {{that is similar to}} his own skin. The board is mentally linked to the Surfer and moves in response to his mental commands even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in physical contact with it. The board is nearly indestructible, but on those rare occasions when it has been damaged or destroyed, the Surfer has proven able to repair it, or even recreate it, with little effort. The Surfer can attack opponents remotely by directing the board against them, and the board is capable of absorbing and imprisoning other beings, at least temporarily.|$|E

25|$|Backyard cricket, Beach cricket, Street cricket are all {{different}} names {{used to describe}} {{a wide range of}} related informal games. The rules are often ad hoc, and the laws of cricket, such as those involving leg before wicket, penalty runs, and others, are ignored or modified to suit both the setting and participants' preferences. In India and Pakistan, there is Gali cricket ('gali' in Hindi means 'street'. It is pronounced as 'gully' but {{should not be confused with}} the fielding position). Often, there are no teams, and each player plays for himself, and fields <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> batting. Often, there is one wicket, and one bowling position, and no overs. If the batsman runs an odd number of runs, he is allowed to walk back to the wicket before the next ball is bowled.|$|E
25|$|Clodoveo is Number One's parrot. He {{is a very}} {{intelligent}} parrot, being able to speak 18 languages and 117 dialects. He is Number One's best friend and lives in his hideout with him, although the two constantly clash on most trivial subjects. He usually serves as the aviation in the TNT group and to carry messages from Number One to the TNT group or his allies <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> around, and often ends up saving them in dangerous missions. He enjoys beef steaks and is a former alcoholic; his drinking habits are occasionally shown throughout the issues. He was absent throughout {{the part of the}} series due to his temporary relocation to Los Angeles when he lived with The Great Caesar; the two constantly clashed and both were relieved when Clodoveo returned to New York.|$|E
25|$|Over his cassock the Pope {{will wear}} a lace rochet. Over the rochet is worn the red Papal mozzetta, a {{shoulder}} cape {{that has a}} collar and is buttoned {{all the way down}} the front. The red color is a vestige from the days when scarlet was the Papal color (white only became associated with the papacy after the Napoleonic wars). The Papal mozzetta had a small hood on the back, which disappeared after Vatican II but has recently been restored. In wintertime, the Papal mozzetta is of red velvet trimmed with ermine (this also fell out of use after Vatican II, but Pope Benedict XVI began again to wear a winter mozzetta trimmed in ermine fur). In summer, the Papal mozzetta is of red satin. The Pope wears a pectoral cross suspended on a gold cord over the mozzetta. He may also choose to wear a red stole with gold embroidery over the mozzetta, even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> officiating at a service.|$|E

25|$|Yamazaki {{was raised}} in Okinawa, growing up on the streets alone {{fighting}} against sailors during his teenage years, then as an enforcer for a criminal mob. In contrast {{with most of the}} other fighters in combat video games, Yamazaki does not use any particular martial art - he is a self-taught brawler, and uses a wide variety of attacks in his fighting, including unfair and dishonest moves such as kicking sand in his opponent's eyes, and his ever-present knife. He also rarely takes his right hand out of his pocket unless he is using his knife. In order to adapt him to KOF, the game planner had to provide new moves to Yamazaki. The new moves were initially noted to be failures, but designers later thought of them as successful. Yamazaki is a very sadistic person who enjoys violence as well as injuring people and making them bleed. However, he normally hides this madness with a calmer and more confident personality which he has <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fighting. As a criminal, Yamazaki started a rivalry with the Hong Kong detective Hon Fu, who becomes determined to arrest Yamazaki, while Yamazaki continually evades him.|$|E
