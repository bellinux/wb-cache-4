Ramon formed an alliance in late 1992 with Ric Flair, who Hart defeated to win the title belt. During an interview in which Hart <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> upcoming match, Ramon and Flair came to the ring and attacked Hart.

A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid-set, {{with people in}} the audience yelling [...] "here comes the gravy!" [...] when Thornton tried to explain he liked Canadians but not the CBC radio host. Before the show, when asked about his [...] "gravy" [...] comment, Thornton claimed he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> radio host. Local reviews of Thornton's Toronto performance were not positive. Toronto Star called Thornton's voice a [...] "high, tinny whine" [...] and The Globe and Mail commented that [...] "Nelson could teach Billy Bob Thornton more than a few things". On April 10, The Boxmasters dropped out of the tour early, announcing {{that they would not be}} playing with Nelson during subsequent concerts scheduled in London, Ontario and Montreal. Thornton said that band members had come down with the flu. Willie Nelson's publicist had no comment.|$|E

500|$|Developed {{over the}} years 1926–1929 at Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Langley Field in Virginia, a forward-looking {{doctrine}} of daylight precision bombing was promulgated by four instructors who argued that an enemy's army and navy could be defeated intact due {{to the destruction of}} industrial and military targets deep within enemy-held territory. This theory was first espoused by Italian General Giulio Douhet, though his ideas included the terror bombing of population centers that the American theorists eschewed. In contrast, American theorists devised a strategy of pin-point bombing that targeted the enemy economy and the production of weapons. Though unproven, the major attraction of this sort of strategic bombing doctrine was that a war was expected to be won relatively quickly, with minimal casualties, and that grinding, static trench warfare as seen in World War I could be avoided. In November 1932 when British Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin said [...] "the bomber will always get through", he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> terror bombing of cities. The US Bomber Mafia agreed with Baldwin only in that the bomber would prevail in its mission. They intended the mission to be against military and industrial targets, not populations.|$|E

[...] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, Martí became {{increasingly}} alarmed about the United States' intentions for Cuba.

Cuba was a profitable, fertile country with an important strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico. In an Interamerican Congress summoned in Washington in October 1889 to discuss U.S. position on Cuba, purchase, annexation, and seizure were discussed. Martí [...] opposed to this expansionism, reiterating his constant position: full independence for Cuba and nothing else. The interests of Cuba's future lay with its sister nations in Latin America, and were opposite to those of the United States.|$|E

[...] The concept of the album was inspired by his troubled hometown of Chicago: [...] "We came up with this concept 'nobody's smiling.'

2500|$|Arnett {{wrote the}} {{following}} {{in one of}} his most iconic dispatches, published on 7 February 1968, about the provincial capital Bến Tre: [...] "'It became necessary to destroy the town to save it,' a United States major said today. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> decision by allied commanders to bomb and shell the town regardless of civilian casualties, to rout the Vietcong." [...] The quotation was distorted in subsequent publications, eventually becoming the more familiar, [...] "We had to destroy the village in order to save it." [...] The accuracy of the original quotation and its source have often been called into question. [...] Arnett never revealed his source, except {{to say that it was}} one of four officers he interviewed that day. US Army Major Phil Cannella, the senior officer present at Bến Tre, suggested that the quotation might have been a distortion of something he said to Arnett. The New Republic at the time attributed the quotation to US Air Force Major Chester L. Brown. In Walter Cronkite's 1971 book, Eye on the World, Arnett reasserted that the quotation was something [...] "one American major said to me in a moment of revelation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, {{people in}} New York, Pennsylvania, and {{elsewhere}} in the United States would start a conversation with [...] "Have you seen Tom Collins?" [...] After the listener predictably reacts by explaining {{that they did not know}} a Tom Collins, the speaker would assert that Tom Collins <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> listener to others and that Tom Collins was [...] "just around the corner", [...] "in a [...] bar," [...] or somewhere else near. The conversation about the nonexistent Tom Collins was a proven hoax of exposure. In The Great Tom Collins hoax of 1874, as it became known, the speaker would encourage the listener to act foolishly by reacting to patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality. In particular, the speaker desired the listener to become [...] at the idea of someone talking about them to others such that the listener would rush off to find the purportedly nearby Tom Collins. Similar to the New York Zoo hoax of 1874, several newspapers propagated the very successful practical joke by printing stories containing false sightings of Tom Collins. The 1874 hoax quickly gained such notoriety that several 1874 music hall songs memorialized the event (copies of which now are in the U.S. Library of Congress).|$|E

2500|$|The {{audience}} {{disagreed with}} Carruthers. They expressed {{that the show}} made a [...] "ludicrous decision" [...] to keep Babe over Dixie. On February 18, 2007, {{it was reported that}} Cady McClain, Dixie's portrayer, had spoken out about what happened via her blog [...] {{to set the record straight}} and to ease the nerves of fans. Viewers had often voiced that Dixie was killed off because McClain was very out-spoken about matters she disagreed with in regards to the soap opera and executives. In December 2006, McClain learned that Dixie would be one of the Satin Slayer's victims. It was not until several weeks later, however, that the news of McClain's exit leaked to the media. Viewers speculated that her dismissal was due to her outspokenness about the exit of Emmy-winning actress Julia Barr (ex-Brooke English). Seemingly adding credibility to the rumor was a report from Fox News Channel stating that McClain's outspokenness led to ABC executives firing McClain. McClain responded on her blog: [...] "Who is this guy from Fox news and what does he know?" [...] She stated that her blog entries were always approved by ABC executives before they were posted to the Internet. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character of Brooke when I said 'life is not fair,' [...] not Julia getting let go." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was alleged by Tiernan that Hanna {{was used}} as an agent by British Military Intelligence, and that his Army {{handlers}} often took Hanna on fishing trips to the Corbet Lough outside Banbridge. Middle-ranking officers of the Intelligence Corps based at Army headquarters in Lisburn were frequent visitors to his Houston Park home in Lurgan's Mourneview estate. They provided him with weapons and petrol for his car. He also invited regular soldiers to his house for [...] "cups of tea". Tiernan also stated that he discovered through personal contacts with former UVF associates of Hanna the names of four British Army officers and one RUC Special Branch officer who helped him plan the 1974 car bombings and who were also involved in earlier attacks in Dublin which had taken place in 1972 and 1973. These UVF men, from the Portadown and Lurgan areas as well as Belfast, had taken part in the Dublin and Monaghan attacks; they all confirmed that Hanna was the mastermind behind the bombings and that army officers were involved in the operation. On pages 89 and 90 of his book, The Dublin Bombings and the Murder Triangle, Tiernan wrote:"One former UVF man now in his seventies, {{who was a member of}} Billy's squad and whom Gardai named as having been involved in the Dublin bombings, told me during research for this book that Billy worked as a UVF agent for army intelligence officers in Lisburn. He said two middle-ranking officers in plain clothes travelled down from Lisburn once a fortnight in a van to meet Billy and give him instructions on what they wanted done. They would visit his house from time to time and they took him fishing to Banbridge. I saw them in his house a couple of times through the window as I approached but as no member of the unit was allowed to meet them I turned and went home and saw Billy later. But mostly they met him away from his house in carparks or the like. They would meet him in Portadown, Lurgan, Banbridge or out the country somewhere. Occasionally when our unit met to plan operations someone might ask Billy a question about some aspect of the operation. If Billy did not know the answer his reply would be: 'I'll have to take advice on that'. No one pushed the matter further but everyone knew Billy <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> army".|$|E
