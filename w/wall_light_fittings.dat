A small kitchenette and fridge {{are located in the}} south-eastern corner.|$|E
50|$|The French {{windows to}} the garden terrace were full height and oak framed, with small glazing panels. Heavy plain {{curtains}} were hung on {{what appear to be}} plain tubular rails, probably of brass.The stair hall shows a similar approach to finishes and furnishings. The stair itself is of oak with high quality joinery as in all Prior's buildings. The twisted oak balustrade echos the form of the twisting chimneys outside. Oak panelling was used in the billiard room and included Prior's usual use of built in facilities. Ceiling treatments were generally simple, in white distemper. <b>Lighting</b> <b>fittings</b> were typical of the Arts and Craft Movement with a range of ceiling and <b>wall</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>fittings,</b> generally with luminaires suspended by chains with glass shades.|$|R
50|$|The {{floors are}} timber and joinery {{throughout}} is of cedar with deep skirtings, wide architraves and sills, panelled doors, fireplace surrounds, French doors and casement windows. The water closet contains an early flushing cistern, and gas piping for the <b>light</b> <b>fittings.</b> The present kitchen has pressed metal sheets {{to the walls}} with <b>wall</b> mounted gas <b>light</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{three level}} base is sparsely adorned, {{providing}} {{a platform for}} the verticalaity of the upper floors. The prominent entry is formed by a three storey deep onset within the central bay. The building is remarkably intact; the double height square bays of the ground floor are occupied by original bronze shopfronts, the prominent building name metal signage above is unchanged, and the lobby retains its black marble <b>walls,</b> signboard, <b>light</b> <b>fittings</b> and lifts.|$|R
50|$|Panelled timber {{doors with}} fretwork fanlights are {{opposite}} {{each other at}} the back of the hall. They each lead into large rooms, formerly the wards of the sanatorium, now subdivided into four small rooms. These rooms do not have full height partitions and the space of the wards is discernible. The raked ceiling is lined with tongue-and-groove with two horizontal bracing members running across the room at the same level as the top of the <b>walls.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>fittings</b> and switches are suspended from these members. The northern face of the ceiling has a centrally located, timber framed, fixed glass skylight whilst on the western and eastern walls respectively, there are small corrugated fibreglass panels that also let in light. A section of rendered brick provides evidence of the chimney once located in the eastern ward. The chimney remains in the western ward, however, it has been blocked up and there is no fireplace. Evidence of windows is visible along the northern walls of both wards.|$|R
50|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{furnishings}} and medical equipment. There {{is no evidence of}} the operating theatre equipment, beds, cupboards and other moveable equipment. Some material remaining prior to the fire included benching along the eastern <b>wall,</b> timber shelving, <b>light</b> <b>fittings</b> and timber shoring in the north tunnel. There was also a considerable amount of post war material such as files, X-ray plates and medical equipment such as an autoclave. It is believed that the files and X-ray plates fuelled the 1997 fire.|$|R
2500|$|A {{lampholder}} plug {{fits into}} the bayonet cap or Edison screw socket of a lampholder {{in place of a}} light bulb and enables an electrical appliance to be powered from a <b>wall</b> or ceiling <b>light</b> <b>fitting.</b> As mentioned in Early History above, they were first introduced in the late 1800s and in use to the 1960s in situations where wall sockets were scarce and sometimes non-existent in some rooms (bathrooms, cellars, attics, etc.). Also, as in some countries (such as Italy) electricity was supplied on a [...] "split tariff" [...] basis with electricity for lighting being charged at a lower rate than that for other purposes, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs and were thus in broad use.|$|R
5000|$|Work {{started on}} {{returning}} {{the ground floor}} rooms to their original condition. The 230mÂ² dining room with its original windows and rehabilitated <b>wall</b> coverings and <b>light</b> <b>fittings</b> is described {{as one of the}} most precious Jugenstil (Art Nouveau) interiors in Switzerland. In 2010 the bar came back into operation with its original [...] "seating booths", along with the cinema room. Work has also progressed reinstating and restoring the bedrooms: those on the first, second and third floors now have modern en suite bathrooms, though less expensive rooms on the fourth floor with access to shared shower and wc facilities are still available. [...] The original wall paintings had been covered over with white paint and are initially visible only in small carefully exposed [...] "windows" [...] in the coating. The old Rattan furnishings are being recreated by a family firm in Viet Nam, using the original specifications.|$|R
50|$|The main bedroom has {{an early}} pendant <b>light</b> <b>fitting</b> and two early brass <b>wall</b> <b>lights</b> in the {{north-east}} corner. The bay window contains the original bench window seat and brass window hardware. The second bedroom mirrors this decoration scheme. The enclosed western verandah {{serves as a}} third bedroom. Eight-light french doors open onto this space from the main and second bedrooms.|$|R

40|$|Urges for {{sustainable}} development had pushed the government and professional bodies to respond and react by implementing regulations where possible to direct development in that manner. However, the outcome in most financial conferences and dialogues on sustainable buildings flagged on high construction and maintenance cost. Thus, this study is conducted to collect and analyze actual building operation and maintenance cost between GBI and Non-GBI rated buildings in Malaysia which are more than 2 years fully operated buildings. There are two categories of selected buildings which are residential and non-residential type of building. Each category of the building consists of similar buildingâs characteristic such as geographic location, mode of operation, building heights, total numbers of floors and units. The scope of buildingâs maintenance for this study is mainly on wear and tear of the <b>wall</b> painting, electrical <b>light</b> <b>fittings,</b> ceiling panels, roofing system and mechanical services like water pump system are recorded for their replacement frequency of service and the cost involved within a consistent period of 12 months operation at cost percentage saving of 78. 9 % and 40. 4 % for residential and non-residential buildings respectively compare against Non-GBI rated buildings. Electricity consumption for GBI rated buildings are lower than Non-GBI rated buildings which recorded at the cost variance of 23. 8 % and 6. 3 % and water consumption at 35. 9 % and 44. 0 % for the above mentioned two main categories of selected case study buildings. Results from this study conclude major savings on residential buildings category in term of maintenance cost and electricity consumption for GBI rated buildings. Whereby, non-residential category of buildings, GBI rated building had been proven to obtain significant savings in terms of maintenance cost and water consumption...|$|R
