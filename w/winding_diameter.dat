40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} turbo {{injection}} mode (TIM) for an axial flux motor to apply onto {{injection molding machine}}. Since the injection molding machine requires different speed and force parameters setting when finishing a complete injection process. The interleaved winding structure in the motor provides two different injection levels to provide enough injection forces. Two wye-wye windings are designed to switch two control modes conveniently. Wye-wye configuration is used to switch two force levels for the motor. When only one set of wye-winding is energized, field weakening function is achieved. Both of the torque and speed increase under field weakening operation. To achieve two control objectives for torque and speed of the motor, fuzzy based multiple performance characteristics index (MPCI) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used {{to find out the}} multiobjective optimal design solution. Both of the torque and speed are expected to be maximal at the same time. Three control factors are selected as studied factors: <b>winding</b> <b>diameter,</b> winding type, and air-gap. Experimental results show that both of the torque and speed increase under the optimal condition. This will provide enough large torque and speed to perform the turbo injection mode in injection process for the injection molding machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} is concentrated on analytical winding size optimization (thickness or diameter) of high-frequency power inductors wound with foil, solid-round wire, multi-strand wire, and litz-wire conductors. The first part of this research concerns analytical optimization of the winding size (thickness or diameter) for the inductors conducting a sinusoidal current. Estimation of winding resistance in individual inductor layers made of foil, taking into account the skin and proximity effects is performed. Approximated equations for the winding power loss in each layer are given and the optimal values of foil thickness for each layer are derived. A low- and medium-frequency approximation of Dowell 2 ̆ 7 s equation for the multilayer foil winding is derived and analyzed. A new closed-form equation for the optimum foil thickness at which the global minimum of the winding ac resistance occurs is derived and an equation for the foil winding hill thickness at which the local maximum of the winding ac resistance is obtained is given. An analytical optimization of solid-round-wire windings conducting a sinusoidal current is performed. New closed-form analytical equations are derived for the normalized valley diameter, normalized hill diameter, and normalized critical diameter. An approximate model for multi-strand wire winding, including litz-wire winding is presented. The proposed model is evaluated using Dowell 2 ̆ 7 s equation. The model takes into consideration the existence of proximity effect within the litz-wire bundle, i. e., between the strands as well the skin effect. New closed-form analytical equations are derived for the normalized strand diameter to achieve the local minimum of the ac winding losses for sinusoidal current. The second part of this research concerns analytical optimization of the winding size (thickness or diameter) for the inductors conducting harmonic currents with and without dc offset. Analytical winding power loss minimization of foil inductors conducting ac harmonic currents with and without dc offset is presented. Equations for the optimum foil thickness of inductors operating with multi-harmonic ac currents and equation for the optimum foil thickness of inductors operating with multi-harmonic ac currents superimposed on the dc current are derived. The design procedure for the foil inductor with optimized foil thickness is presented for a pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) dc-dc boost converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). An analytical optimization of solid-round-wire windings conducting both the dc and ac non-sinusoidal periodic currents is performed. Closed-form analytical equations for the normalized total-power-valley diameter and the normalized total-power-critical diameter are derived for inductors conducting ac non-sinusoidal periodic currents superimposed on the dc component. A design procedure of the inductor with an optimized <b>winding</b> <b>diameter</b> operating in PWM dc-dc buck converter in DCM is also presented. Experimental verification of an analytical equations for foil, solid-round-wire, and litz-wire windings conducting sinusoidal currents is performed.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of using inductive links for a vehicle application where wiring an electronic control unit (ECU) to the sensors or detectors become unfeasible or unpractical. The selected application is occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats. Two ways of using inductive links are considered: 1) passive detection {{of the state of}} the seat detectors from a readout unit and 2) remote power transmission to a detection unit and subsequent data transmission by a wireless transceiver. Inductive links have been widely proposed for sensors placed in harsh or inaccessible environments, where wiring is unpractical. Usually, the sensor forms part of an LC resonant network. The resonant frequency is dependent on the quantity to be measured and is estimated from a coupled reader. We propose the use of inductive links for switch-type sensors. First, a comprehensive analysis for an arbitrary number of sensors is presented. Secondly, we show {{the feasibility of}} using inductive links for occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats. The state (open or closed) of the related sensors was attained by first measuring the equivalent resistance of the readout inductor and then estimating its resonant frequency. Commercial ferrite-core coils were used to increase the detection distance. Experimental tests were carried out using an impedance analyzer connected to the readout coil and commercial seat detectors connected to the resonant network. The detection of the sensors¿ state was feasible at all tested distances, from 0. 5 cm up to 3 cm. The second proposed alternative consists on remote powering, via an inductive link, the electronic device where the seat detectors are connected. Resonant coupled coils were used in order to increase the powering distance range and the power efficiency. Working frequency was restricted to 150 kHz. Commercial small-size magnetic-core coils were selected and their resistance and quality factor over frequency measured. At the receiving network, a rectifier and a voltage regulator were required to provide a DC voltage supply to the autonomous sensor. Four type of voltage regulators were compared from the point of view of the system power efficiency. Both a theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented. Results showed that shunt regulators provide the best power efficiency over the other alternatives, which are linear series and switching buck and boost regulators. On the other hand boost regulators led to an unstable behavior of the system in most of the cases. The use of rechargeable batteries was also considered in order to increase the power efficiency. Achieved power efficiencies were around 40 %, 25 % and 10 % for coil distances of 1 cm, 1. 5 cm and 2 cm respectively. Experimental tests also showed that the autonomous sensor was properly powered up to coil distances of 2. 5 cm. Finally, different types of coils were assessed and the effect of metallic structures analyzed for the intended application. The final aim is, on the one hand, to increase the powering distance and, on the other hand, to minimize the influence of the metallic structures. Three different coil types, two with ferrite-core coils and one with an air-core coil were used. Numerical results showed that ferrite-core coils are less affected by the presence of metallic structures. Experimental results showed that the air-core coils provided a larger powering distance thanks to its much larger <b>winding</b> <b>diameter.</b> However, when approaching a metallic plate, the transferred power with the air-core coils to the load was insufficient for the intended application. On the other hand, ferrite-core coils barely noticed the presence of the metallic plate. As for the passive detection, the presence of a metallic plate below the primary air-core coil slightly affected the measured resistance values but detection for the four possible states of the seat detectors was still possible. Algunes aplicacions a l'entorn de l'automòbil no són possibles si no és mitjançant la connexió sense fils dels seus dispositius a causa que el cablejat és difícil o inviable. Alguns exemples els trobem en el monitoratge de sensors situats en parts rotatòries, com les rodes, o en elements extraïbles, com els seients. Els sistemes de monitoratge de la pressió de l'aire en les rodes (TPMS) són d'obligat compliment als EUA i ho seran en breu també als països membres de la UE per als vehicles de categories M 1 o N 1 aprovats a partir de l' 1 de novembre de 2012 o per als vehicles matriculats a partir de l' 1 de novembre de 2014. Actualment, els sistemes TPMS existents al mercat estan alimentats per piles. Amb tot, la vida útil exigida per a les bateries és d'uns 10 anys, esdevenint el seu ús un autèntic repte. Un altre element en contra de l'ús de bateries és la directiva 2006 / 66 /CE que limita el nombre màxim permès en els vehicles. D'altra banda, moltes furgonetes o mini furgonetes i vehicles familiars incorporen seients extraïbles amb l'objectiu d'aprofitar al màxim l'espai interior. Alguns models comercials incorporen en el seient extraïble el detector de cinturó de seguretat. Per evitar el cablejat, existeixen sistemes de detecció passiva mitjançant acoblament inductiu. A partir del present any 2012, una regulació de la agència nord-americana NHTSA requereix de l'ús de coixins de seguretat intel·ligents per minimitzar els riscos en nens. Aquests seients intel·ligents haurien de detectar si el passatger és un adult, una cadira infantil o si està lliure per evitar problemes ocorreguts en anterioritat amb els sistemes coixí de seguretat. Els sensors usats per a aquests coixins de seguretat intel·ligents requeririen d'energia per operar. Una opció per als seients extraïbles és la transmissió de potència via acoblament inductiu des del terra del xassís del vehicle fins al seient. També és possible usar l'acoblament inductiu per detectar l'estat de diversos sensors existents en els seients extraïbles mitjançant detecció passiva. Precisament, la detecció d'ocupació i de cinturó de seguretat en seients extraïbles ha estat seleccionada per aplicar la investigació present que consisteix, d'una banda, en el monitoratge de sensors de tipus commutat (dos possibles estats) via acoblament inductiu i, per una altra, en la transmissió mitjançant el mateix principi físic de la potència necessària per alimentar els sensors autònoms remots. En els dos casos, una primera bobina es fixaria en el seient extraïble, connectada als sensors, i una segona bobina se situaria sota la primera, en el terra del vehicle...|$|E
