5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> riders board.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} subsequently {{retreated to}} Chonan, <b>where,</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> night the 3rd Battalion was heavily engaged in another delaying action. The 34th Infantry lost its commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin {{as well as}} two thirds of its 3rd Battalion's strength. The exhausted 34th Infantry Regiment retreated to the Kum River, near the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. The 24th Infantry Division would make one final delaying action before it would be forced to make its final stand around Taejon, the only major defensible city left before the Pusan Perimeter being established by the Eighth Army.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E

5|$|The {{boxes are}} found to have been bought with bogus names and cash 23 years ago. Raul's amputated forearm is {{examined}} and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these are after effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul {{from one of his}} old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit boxes are his. Walter tries to remember what he put in the boxes and <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able to wound and capture one of the men.|$|E

25|$|Finally the British {{adopted the}} {{strategy}} which the locals had been recommending from the beginning. This involved dividing the vast territory into 11 military provinces and stationing a mounted garrison in each. If a rebel regiment was encountered it was chased, until it entered the next military province, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> garrison (fresh {{and close to}} supplies) would take over the pursuit. The valley exits from the range were then fortified. Under this uninterrupted pressure the rebel forces quickly splintered and began to surrender, Sandile himself fled down into {{the valley of the}} Fish River where he was intercepted by a Fengu commando. In the final shoot out he was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. The surviving rebels were granted an amnesty.|$|E
25|$|Aibara was a {{right-handed}} middle order batsman {{and often}} captained Hyderabad. He {{played a part}} in both of Hyderabad's two Ranji Trophy wins despite them being 50 years apart, as a player in 1937-38 where he scored the match winning hundred and as coach in 1986-87. His effort in the 1937-38 Final against Nawanagar is what he is best remembered for, his innings of 137 not out came in a game <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> highest score by a player from either team was 67 and it was his maiden first-class hundred. Hyderabad had been dismissed for just 113 in their first innings and were set the task of chasing 310 to win in the fourth innings.

25|$|He {{was also}} a good bowler. He took three 4-wicket hauls in the shorter version of {{the game with a}} best of 4/31. Arthurton {{was also a}}n {{excellent}} fielder.

25|$|Heading {{south from}} the A2, Ringway 2 would have crossed {{golf courses and}} sports grounds west of Avery Hill to reach the A20 at Mottingham where its next {{junction}} would have been constructed. Next, heading west out of the London Borough of Greenwich, the motorway would have briefly crossed {{the northern tip of}} the London Borough of Bromley, via another group of playing fields before entering the London Borough of Lewisham to connect to the A2212 near Grove Park station. Here the route encounters the first substantial urban development cutting an alignment through the London County Council's Downham Estate â€“ land already in public ownership, thereby avoiding the need for expensive land purchases and compensation payments. Here the motorway would have run parallel with Shroffold Road and Durham Hill to cross Downham Fields then run parallel with Downham Way to meet Bromley Road (A21) <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> junction would have been located.|$|E
25|$|As expected, {{the first}} three games of the series were tight-checking, low-scoring {{contests}} featuring stellar goaltending {{at both ends of}} the ice. Niittymaki, however, who was just a little bit better than Lehtonen, earned a surprise 1â€“0 shutout victory in Game 1. He was even better in Game 2, however, holding the high-scoring Wolves to just one goal in a 2â€“1 double overtime victory to send the series back to Philadelphia <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three gamesâ€”if necessaryâ€”would be played and where the Phantoms were already 11â€“0 in the playoffs. Niittymaki again held the Wolves to just one goal as the Phantoms defeated Chicago again, 2â€“1, in Game 3. Through almost 11 periods of hockey over three games, Niittymaki had allowed the Wolves, who had scored 245 regular season goals, just two goals while Lehtonen and had been solved for just five by the Phantoms. The differential of three goals, however, was enough to give Philadelphia a 3â€“0 stranglehold on the series going into Game 4 on June 10.|$|E

Michael's last victim is Solomon Bates, the third partner of John Kramer and Art Blank. Bates altered finances and forged books to cover for a larger group of criminals. Upon being saved by Michael, Bates reveals that Henry Jacobs, Joseph Poltzer, Sarah Blalock, Carla Song, and himself were {{all part of a}} large drug operation. It was also revealed that David Tapp, Michael's father, discovered this operation while chasing Jigsaw but was more interested in pursuing him rather than corrupt cops. Michael also admits to stealing his father's files on Jigsaw, and using the files to advance his reporting career. The files, in which David admitted that his raid on Jigsaw's lair was without a warrant, was used as grounds by the corrupt Henry Jacobs to fire David to cover up his drug ring.|$|E
