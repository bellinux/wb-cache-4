5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for this job put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.|$|E
25|$|COR {{was founded}} in November 1952. Before that, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> legitimately kosher meat in Toronto {{because there was no}} regulation. The Canadian Jewish Congress was asked to set up a system to ensure {{legitimacy}} of the kosher status of meat in Toronto. In 1954, a Rabbinical Board called the “Vaad Hakashruth of the Canadian Jewish Congress of the Central Region” was established. It then consisted of 12 Rabbis, having grown to 26 members as of 2017. In June 1956, the name of the Vaad Hakashruth was changed to the Council of Orthodox Rabbis, the source of the abbreviation COR. In the early 1960s, COR successfully appealed to Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker to have Shechita legally approved by the federal government and protected by Canadian law. For many years, Rabbi Gedalia Felder was the chairman of the Vaad Hakashruth, and in 2006, his son Rabbi Yacov Felder became the vice chairman, and eventually the chairman.|$|E

Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered Island Studios in August 1973. As with Foxtrot, John Burns helped with production. Burns' technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment, and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements. Banks recalled the sessions being difficult, adding [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things going".
