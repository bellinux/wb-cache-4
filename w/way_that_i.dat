5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Merleau-Ponty {{demonstrates}} a corporeity of consciousness {{as much as}} an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar as I have hands, feet; a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not choose” (1962, p.440).|$|E
25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E
60|$|It is in these, {{and similar}} <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have often myself been highly benefited in visiting schools, and in reading {{descriptions}} of them; {{and it is}} for such purposes, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> insert the account here.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why,' replied Mr. Pickwick, {{slightly}} {{embarrassed by}} the question, 'the fact is, I have been so much engaged in other <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really have not had an opportunity of perusing them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{how could}} you say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should marry some town man? I am sure, say what you will, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must marry Diggory, if I marry at all. He has been kinder to me than anybody else, and has helped me in many <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't know of!" [...] Thomasin almost pouted now.|$|R
500|$|McCown also {{acknowledged}} his backup {{position on the}} team, and told the Chicago Tribune, [...] "The <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> serve my team is to play when the starter is not healthy. Jay is our starting quarterback, {{there is no doubt}} about that." ...|$|E
500|$|LeGrow {{called it}} [...] "worded in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt was {{offensive}} {{to me and}} to cosplayers" [...] and noted that [...] "none of it reflects my opinions." [...] Fan reaction to learning that the statement was inaccurate was generally relief since [...] "they felt it didn't mesh with [...] personality." [...] She stated: ...|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Swift {{has stated}} that the song was {{something}} typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time, adding [...] "I didn't know anything then." [...] She explained, [...] "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would say that and the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would feel that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving {{on a personal level}} and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E
60|$|Yours received. The best I {{can do with}} it is, {{to refer}} it to the War Department. The Rock Island case {{referred}} to, was my individual enterprise; and it caused so much difficulty in so many <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> promised to never undertake another.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thet same party I'd knowed better nor fower year, two on 'em campin' out together. Not that I'd {{known him}} all the time, fur he war shy and strange at spells and had odd <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took war nat'ral to a borned poet. Ye may {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{said he was a}} borned poet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a {{good many}} <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might pull you through," [...] Master Fernald replied, {{with an air of}} mystery. [...] "If you knew as much about this {{business}} as I do, you'd be mighty glad to have me stay, 'specially when it ain't costin' you a cent." ...|$|R
500|$|Moynihan later {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the resulting episode; he felt that, while he took creative risks with the episode, his efforts fell flat. In an online interview, he explained, [...] "I think Ako's parts are funny, but everything I wrote in the episode played out in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't expect. It's the one episode I've worked on that I really feel didn't do anything I intended." ...|$|E
500|$|... "If you bind {{me so that}} I am {{unable to}} release myself, then you will be {{standing}} by in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should {{have to wait a}} long time before I got any help from you. I am reluctant to have this band put on me. But rather than that you question my courage, let someone put his hand in my mouth as a pledge that this is done in good faith." ...|$|E
500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified <b>way,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{physicists}} {{have not}} been big users of libraries. Now {{that so much of}} the information they need is on-line, interactions between faculty and librarians have become few and far between. Here are some of the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have built connections with the physics community at Cornell and beyond...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seeing I've {{been kept}} {{down to the}} old brown pair {{for the last six}} weeks because all the others were being got ready for Master Georgie, I should say there might be," [...] the father chuckled. [...] "They're {{reminding}} me in a hundred <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must take the second place now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{had no need}} to do <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> had fully {{resolved}} when I spoke yesterday. Dr. Mulbridge, why didn't you {{spare me}} this? It's unkind of you to insist, after what I said. You know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must hate to repeat it. I do value you so highly in some <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> blame you for obliging me to hurt you--if it does hurt--by telling you again <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't love you." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1976, at age 16 and as {{a member}} of the Melbourne punk rock band Young Charlatans, Howard wrote [...] "Shivers". Discussing the song's origins, Howard said that [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "intended as an ironic comment on the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt that people I knew were making hysterical things out of what were {{essentially}} high school crushes". He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, Sarsgaard stated that he followed Catholicism, saying: [...] "I like the death-cult aspect of Catholicism. Every religion is interested in death, but Catholicism takes it to a particularly high level. [...] Seriously, in Catholicism, you're supposed to love your enemy. That really impressed me as a kid, and it has helped me as an actor. [...] The <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> view the characters I play is part of my religious upbringing. To abandon curiosity in all personalities, good or bad, is to give up hope in humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E
60|$|It was {{in these}} <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> began {{to form a}} shy disposition; to be of a timidly silent {{character}} under misconstruction; to have an inexpressible, perhaps a morbid, dread of ever being sordid or worldly. It was in these <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> my nature came to shape itself to such a mould, even before it was affected by the influences of the studious and retired life of a poor scholar.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{consider}} myself a populist artist," [...] Fairey says. [...] "I want to reach people through as many different platforms as possible. Street art is a bureaucracy-free way of reaching people, but T-shirts, stickers, commercial jobs, the Internet – {{there are so many}} different <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> use to put my work in front of people." ...|$|R

500|$|Often {{described}} by the media as [...] "America's Sweetheart", Swift insists that [...] "I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel like, and {{that makes me feel}} very free". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots, although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol. Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People annual best dressed list. In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards, and ranked first in Maxim Hot 100 list.|$|E
500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ... But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker. He did I Am Legend and I'm a huge Will Smith fan, so I knew he could execute the video in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could give him all my weirdest, most psychotic ideas ... But it would come across to and be relevant to the public.|$|E
500|$|Bartley recounts {{a revelation}} that Erhard {{said he had}} {{experienced}} in March 1971 while driving into San Francisco, California to work at Grolier Society. Erhard described to Bartley what the revelation experience felt like: [...] "What happened had no form. It was timeless, unbounded, ineffable, beyond language." [...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life. I saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, {{to be different from}} the way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{so totally}} unlike," [...] said Fanny, {{avoiding}} a direct answer, [...] "we are so very, {{very different in}} all our inclinations and <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together, even if I could like him. There never were two people more dissimilar. We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Springsteen {{calls this}} song [...] "emotionally autobiographical." [...] The bitter, but loving {{relationship}} between {{the father and son}} is similar to Springsteen's with his dad. Springsteen once said: [...] "Our actual relationship was probably more complicated than how I presented it. Those songs were <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spoke to my father at the time, because he didn't speak and we didn't talk very much." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the case}} was {{otherwise}} here. My mother was convicted of felony for a certain petty theft scarce worth naming, viz. having an opportunity of borrowing three pieces of fine holland of a certain draper in Cheapside. The circumstances are too long to repeat, and I have heard them related so many <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can scarce be certain which is the right account.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, {{what would happen if}} I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E
500|$|In April 1890, {{during the}} run of The Gondoliers, however, Gilbert {{challenged}} Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged {{the cost of a}} new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that [...] "I left him with the remark that {{it was a mistake to}} kick down the ladder by which he had risen". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte [...] "in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial." [...] As the scholar Andrew Crowther has commented: ...|$|E
500|$|Monáe {{has said}} about the {{recording}} sessions [...] "Over {{the last year and}} a half when we were recording the ArchAndroid I went through a very transformative period in my life". Monáe completed the album in Atlanta at the Wondaland Studios and the famous asylum The Palace of the Dogs. Monáe has stated that the album signifies [...] "breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types". She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places we were on tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, we all had an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed my way of thinking, the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> approach the stage and overall, my life".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he admitted, [...] "it hurts, but I {{must bear}} it. And I {{want to say}} that I'm glad in several <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> met you." [...] Then the blood crept into his face again. [...] "I should, at least, like you to think kindly of me, and I'm rather afraid {{appearances}} are against me. Because that is so, there's a thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should like you to understand. I'd have been proud to marry you had you been a beggar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} the time, Rachel," [...] I said, [...] "when {{you could have}} told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had offended you, in a worthier <b>way</b> than <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> beg your pardon." ...|$|R
40|$|Being both a {{librarian}} and an archivist/curator, {{it is one}} of my jobs to find ways to embed primary sources into my library instruction. This paper discuss the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have found to integrate the Latin American and Caribbean archival holdings <b>that</b> <b>I</b> manage in the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center into my library services. I will discuss briefly some of the strategies, such as digitization projects, LibGuides and Show and Tells events, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have used to bridge my archival work with my library work to provide better services to my constituents...|$|R
