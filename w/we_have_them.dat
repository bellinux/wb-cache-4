Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs and remember that the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with our personal beliefs. Discovering our own beliefs and why <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E

In that long chain of transmission the texts have been corrupted, leading Origen to complain in the 3rd century that [...] "the differences among manuscripts have become great, ... either neglect to check over what they have transcribed, or, in the process of checking, they make additions or deletions as they please." ...|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "undisputed" [...] epistles {{represents}} the traditional scholarly consensus asserting that Paul authored each letter. However, even the least disputed of letters, such as Galatians, have found critics. Moreover, {{the unity of}} the letters is questioned by some scholars. First and Second Corinthians have garnered particular suspicion, with some scholars, among them Edgar J. Goodspeed and Norman Perrin, supposing one or both texts as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> today are actually amalgamations of multiple individual letters. There remains considerable discussion as to the presence of possible significant interpolations. However, such textual corruption is difficult to detect and even more so to verify, leaving little agreement as to the extent of the epistles' integrity.|$|E
