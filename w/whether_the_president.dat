5|$|When {{a federal}} court {{released}} former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose as to <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that {{in the interest of}} testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E
50|$|The inner {{beliefs of}} <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> {{are much more}} {{difficult}} to establish than church membership. While some presidents have been relatively voluble about religion, many have been reticent to the point of complete obscurity. Researchers have tried to draw conclusions from patterns of churchgoing or religious references in political speeches. When explicit statements are absent, it is difficult to assess <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> in question were irreligious, were unorthodox in their beliefs, or simply believed that religion was not a matter for public revelation.|$|R
500|$|Harrison's death {{revealed}} {{the flaws in}} the U.S. Constitution's clauses on presidential succession. [...] of the Constitution states: [...] "In Case of the Removal of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on <b>the</b> Vice <b>President...</b> and [...] shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected". Scholars at <b>the</b> time disagreed <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> would become president or merely acting <b>President.</b> <b>The</b> Constitution did not stipulate <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> could serve <b>the</b> remainder of <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> term, until <b>the</b> next election, or if emergency elections should be held.|$|R
50|$|The {{matter was}} {{referred}} to the Constitutional Court by the High Court for confirmation of its order declaring the decision of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to bring <b>the</b> Act into force null and void. The Constitutional Court, in a unanimous decision delivered by Chaskalson P, confirmed {{the order of the}} Transvaal High Court, but gave reasons that were {{different from those of the}} High Court. Two issues had to be decided by the Court. <b>The</b> first was <b>whether</b> or not <b>the</b> High Court’s order, setting aside <b>the</b> <b>President’s</b> decision, was a finding of “constitutional invalidity” that required confirmation by the Constitutional Court under section 172(2) of the Constitution. If so, the second issue was <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President’s</b> decision to bring the Act into force was constitutionally valid or not.|$|R
25|$|<b>Whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> may speak {{publicly}} {{on issues}} without the Government's approval was discussed heavily during the 2011 presidential election. While some candidates {{and members of}} the public suggested that the President has power to do so, the Law Minister, K.Shanmugam, stated that the President's ability to speak freely is limited to those matters that, according to the Constitution, he exercises discretionary powers over. He should not act as a political centre distinct from the Government. A difference of opinion also exists over <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> exercises soft power.|$|E
25|$|After the Senate grants {{advice and}} consent, however, the President is under no {{compulsion}} to commission the officer. It {{has not been}} settled <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has the prerogative to withhold a commission after having signed it. This issue played a large part in the famous court case Marbury v. Madison.|$|E
25|$|The king's {{title in}} the Irish Free State, when it became a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire, and its {{constitutional}} successor from December 1936 to April 1949, {{was the same as}} elsewhere in the British Commonwealth, but it was unclear <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Ireland was Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949 or the King, George VI.|$|E
50|$|Opposition and officialist {{members of}} the Paraguayan Congress {{immediately}} announced {{they were going to}} boycott Duarte's resignation by not attending the extraordinary session of the Congress, a session called in order to debate and determine <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> resignation is accepted or not. If Congress did not accept the resignation, Duarte would have to continue his term until 15 August and would be unable to become an elected senator, becoming instead a non-voting senator for life as a former <b>president.</b> As expected, <b>the</b> quorum was not reached at the extraordinary session called for this reason for 24 June 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Others have {{suggested}} that the order is illegal as it was instituted by executive ordinance rather than being a parliamentary motion. It is questionable as to <b>whether</b> or not <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is legally allowed to create such an order Although <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is [...] "fount of honour" [...] (in that all honours flow from <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> similar to <b>the</b> British model where all honours flow from the Queen) it is debatable as to <b>whether</b> or not <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has <b>the</b> authority to simply create a new order.|$|R
50|$|The {{court had}} to {{determine}} <b>whether</b> Parliament and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had failed in their exclusive constitutional obligation to enact legislation governing Muslim marriages.|$|R
25|$|Burton {{likewise}} {{held that}} Congress, not the President, possessed {{the power to}} act in emergencies because it had exclusive power to pass legislation. He relied on the language and legislative history of the Taft–Hartley Act to find that Congress had not authorized seizure of plants involved in a labor dispute without express legislative authorization. He hedged, however, on <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> might, in more extreme circumstances, have authority to act.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} then {{assigned}} to Judge David Andrew Pine, who heard the steel companies' motions for a preliminary injunction. From a tactical perspective, both sides {{focused on the}} wrong issues: In its papers, the government stressed the ultimate constitutional issue of <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> {{had the power to}} seize the mills; the steel companies appeared to be shying away from that issue by focusing on the equities and asking the Court merely to enjoin the federal government from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with the Steelworkers.|$|E
25|$|The Petition {{was read}} {{in front of}} the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) on 13 May 1980 in an effort to persuade the representatives to ask the {{president}} what he had meant by the two speeches. The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two number of questions to the president. They asked <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed explanation about the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House. One DPR member, Soedardji, did not agree the president had to answer the questions. However, his party colleague Anwar Nuris said it was a normal part of the constitutional process.|$|E
5000|$|The Daily Mail {{noted that}} [...] "when asked <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> son {{might be a}} bit young for such a {{relatively}} prestigious job, EPAD's current <b>president</b> responded using <b>the</b> traditional French political foil of quoting classic literature: [...] "In souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age."

500|$|The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution {{deals with}} {{succession}} to the Presidency and establishes procedures both for filling a vacancy {{in the office}} of <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> as well as responding to Presidential disabilities. It supersedes the ambiguous wording of [...] of the Constitution, which does not expressly state <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> becomes <b>the</b> <b>President</b> or Acting <b>President</b> if <b>the</b> <b>President</b> dies, resigns, is removed from office, or is otherwise unable to discharge the powers of the presidency. The Twenty-fifth Amendment was adopted on February 10, 1967.|$|R
500|$|The opinion then {{addressed}} the substantive {{issues of the}} case. It explicitly did not decide <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> possessed the Constitutional power to convene military commissions like the one created to try Hamdan. Even if he possessed such power, those tribunals would either have to be sanctioned by the [...] "laws of war", as codified by Congress in Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or authorized by statute. As to the statutory authorization, {{there is nothing in}} the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) [...] "even hinting" [...] at expanding the President's war powers beyond those enumerated in Art. 21. Instead, the AUMF, the UCMJ, and the DTA [...] "at most acknowledge" [...] the President's authority to convene military commissions only where justified by the exigencies of war, but still operating within the laws of war.|$|E
500|$|The new Congress, which convened on March 4, 1867, {{was not as}} {{aggressive}} in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped. [...] It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> should be impeached. [...] Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's Benjamin Wade as its president pro tempore, next in line to the presidency {{in the absence of}} a vice president. [...] Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of Das Kapital. Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant. [...] Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did. Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into.|$|E
500|$|Garfield's {{appointment}} of James infuriated Conkling, a factional {{opponent of the}} Postmaster General, who demanded a compensatory appointment for his faction, such as the position of Secretary of the Treasury. The resulting squabble occupied much of Garfield's brief presidency. The feud with Conkling reached a climax when the president, at Blaine's instigation, nominated Conkling's enemy, Judge William H. Robertson, to be Collector of the Port of New York. This {{was one of the}} prize patronage positions below cabinet level, and was then held by Edwin A. Merritt. Conkling raised the time-honored principle of senatorial courtesy in an attempt to defeat the nomination, to no avail. Garfield, who believed the practice was corrupt, would not back down and threatened to withdraw all nominations unless Robertson was confirmed, intending to [...] "settle the question <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States." [...] Ultimately, Conkling and his New York colleague, Senator Thomas C. Platt, resigned their Senate seats to seek vindication, but found only further humiliation when the New York legislature elected others in their places. Robertson was confirmed as Collector and Garfield's victory was clear. To Blaine's chagrin, the victorious Garfield returned to his goal of balancing the interests of party factions, and nominated a number of Conkling's Stalwart friends to offices.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2009 Palikot caused further {{controversy}} when {{he wrote}} in his blog questioning <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Polish <b>President's</b> brother, Jarosław Kaczyński, is gay: [...] "I - unasked - declare unequivocally that I prefer women. And you, Mr Jarosław?" [...] As a result, Donald Tusk, the leader of Palikot's party, the Civic Platform, launched an investigation into his behaviour.|$|R

500|$|On 11 March, {{following}} {{a declaration of}} neutrality by army leadership, pro-opposition soldiers from the CAPSAT (Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services) stormed the army headquarters and forced the {{army chief of staff}} to resign. Over the next several days the army deployed forces to enable the opposition to occupy key ministries, the chief of military police transferred his loyalty to Rajoelina, and the army sent tanks against the president's Iavoloha Palace. Rajoelina rejected Ravalomanana's offer on 15 March to hold a national referendum to determine <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> should resign, and called on security forces to arrest the president. The following day, the army stormed the president's Ambohitsorohitra Palace and captured the Central Bank. Hours later Ravalomanana transferred his power to group of senior army personnel, an act described by the opposition as a voluntary resignation, although Ravalomanana later declared he had been forced at gunpoint to relinquish power. The military council would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the [...] "Fourth Republic". However, Vice Admiral Hyppolite Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated High Transitional Authority (HAT) that he had appointed weeks earlier. With the military's backing, the authority was charged with taking up the task previously accorded to Ravalomanana's proposed military directorate. Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal; the court's statement did not include a justification for its decision.|$|E

2500|$|While Davis wasn't {{brought into}} the case until March 1952, he was already {{familiar}} {{with the concept of}} a presidential seizure of a steel mill.

[...] Davis wrote that the President could not do so, unless such power already was vested in the President by law.

2500|$|Timothy Lynch of the Cato Institute raised {{several issues}} related to the Padilla seizure in an amicus brief he filed to the Supreme Court.

[...] He questioned whether such techniques can be employed against anyone once the president gives an order. Those legal questions remain unsettled.
