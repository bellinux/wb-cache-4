The bluespotted stingray has numerous tiny teeth, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> jaw being slightly convex. They also, like most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E

5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E

5|$|Between 1928 {{until his}} death, al-Qassam {{served as the}} {{president}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was bridged by a convergence in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time. While men from al-Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam's cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation.|$|E
5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E

5|$|From Verbrandesmis a road runs north-west, {{parallel}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Steenbeek through Merckem to Luyghem, {{slightly above}} {{the level of}} the surrounding marshes. Machine-guns nests in the villages, commanded the causeway from Drei Grachten; the ground everywhere in the peninsula was soaked and dotted with large numbers of blockhouses and pillboxes. The French artillery destroyed Verbrandesmis and it was quickly captured but the German garrisons at Jesiutengoed Farm and Kloostermolen held out for some time, before being driven out and forced back to Kippe and Aschhoop. German artillery bombarded the banks of the Steenbeek in front of Merckem and French troops rushed across on pontoon bridges, struggled through the mud to the objectives and then attacked towards Kippe and Luyghem. Kippe and Aschhoop were captured quickly but the German garrisons at Luyghem and the causeway from Drei Grachten, resisted until afternoon before being overwhelmed.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the water surface <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> mandible skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cyclone Erica {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} low which developed within a monsoonal trough near the Tiwi Islands on 13 February. Two days later, the low moved inland near the Western Australia–Northern Territory border. After passing south of Alice Springs, the low turned east and entered the Coral Sea on 3 March 2003. Strong wind shear separated the convection from the system at the time. However, shear quickly weakened the next day. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> shear, the low was able to intensify and at 0630UTC on 4 March, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. Despite the center of the storm being elongated, conditions for further development were present. At 0600UTC the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia upgraded the low to a Category1 cyclone and gave it the name Erica.|$|E
