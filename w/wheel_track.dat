25|$|An {{advantage}} of this design was that the main landing gear, which retracted through an 85-degree angle, {{was attached to the}} fuselage, making it possible to completely remove the wings for servicing without additional equipment to support the fuselage. It also allowed simplification of the wing structure, since it did not have to bear the loads imposed during takeoff or landing. The one major drawback of this landing gear arrangement was its narrow <b>wheel</b> <b>track,</b> making the aircraft unstable while on the ground. To increase stability, the legs were splayed outward somewhat, creating another problem in that the loads imposed during takeoff and landing were transferred up through the legs at an angle.|$|E

Roughness was measured in terms of the heavy articulated truck index (HATI), a measure of pavement ride quality as perceived by heavy truck occupants. Roughness variation between the outer and inner <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> was also investigated. The results showed that lane average values of HATI in truck <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> were higher than in car <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> for about 60 % of the studied network.

2500|$|Visually, the RS 6 {{differed}} from the related S6, having flared front and rear wheel arches (fenders), harking {{back to the original}} Audi Quattro, to allow for a wider <b>wheel</b> <b>track.</b> It also had no front fog lights to allow for larger frontal air intakes (for the two side-mounted intercoolers (SMICs), and additional radiators).

[...] LED lighting technology was also used in the rear lights. [...] The RS 6 also included adaptive headlights, which swivel around corners in conjunction with steering wheel movements.

2500|$|The most {{extensive}} redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop {{was replaced by}} a pillared coupe—named [...] "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated [...] front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. Wheelbase dimensions were retained; [...] a sporty [...] for coupes and [...] for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127mm) [...] longer and an inch wider with a [...] wider <b>wheel</b> <b>track.</b> The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.|$|E

2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a <b>wheel</b> <b>track</b> at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E

60|$|The {{first of}} all these passes was called Tempe, and a body of troops was sent to guard it; but they found that this was useless and impossible, and came back again. The next was at Thermopylae. Look in your map of the Archipelago, or Aegean Sea, {{as it was then}} called, for the great island of Negropont, or by its old name, Euboea. It looks like a piece broken off from the coast, and to the north is shaped like the head of a bird, with the beak running into a gulf, that would fit over it, upon the main land, and between the island and the coast is an {{exceedingly}} narrow strait. The Persian army would have to march round the edge of the gulf. They could not cut straight across the country, because the ridge of mountains called Ceta rose up and barred their way. Indeed, the woods, rocks, and precipices came down so near the seashore, that in two places there was only room for one single <b>wheel</b> <b>track</b> between the steeps and the impassable morass that formed the border of the gulf on its south side. These two very narrow places were called the gates of the pass, and were about a mile apart. There was a little more width left in the intervening space; but in this {{there were a number of}} springs of warm mineral water, salt and sulphurous, which were used for the sick to bathe in, and thus the place was called Thermopylae, or the Hot Gates. A wall had once been built across the western-most of these narrow places, when the Thessalians and Phocians, who lived on either side of it, had been at war with one another; but it had been allowed to go to decay, since the Phocians had found out that there was a very steep narrow mountain path along the bed of a torrent, by which it was possible to cross from one territory to the other without going round this marshy coast road.|$|E
40|$|In the Road Condition Model {{one wants}} to be able to predict the {{transition}} between different winter road conditions. One such example is the transition from loose snow all across the driving lane to loose snow except in <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks,</b> where the condition is changed to ice or bare road. Each vehicle passing as long as there is loose snow across the whole driving lane will remove a certain amount of loose snow from the developing <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks.</b> The amount of removed loose snow is assumed to vary between different types of vehicles. The Road Weather Information System, RWIS, delivers information on the amount of loose snow falling on the road. The traffic flow is measured by inductive loops. The amount of loose snow in <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> is measured intermittent. Then one has information of traffic flow and the amount of removed loose snow from <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> (determined as the difference between the amount af loose snow falling on the road and the amount remaining in the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks).</b> Trough regression analysis one can determine the statistical relation between traffic flow and amount of removed loose snow.

40|$|The {{movement}} {{characteristics of}} aggregates in asphalt mixtures were investigated with <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests under the following loading conditions: reciprocating motion, one-way motion, and one-way motion with braking. The outside <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests used fine and gap graded (13 F) asphalt mixtures. The {{tests showed that}} the amount of rutting in one-way motion was larger than that in reciprocating motion. In the case of reciprocating motion, the surface heaved up at the right load end. In the case of one-way motion, the surface heaved up at the point 50 mm from both contact ends of the tire. Consolidation caused the rutting phenomenon during reciprocating motion, and flow caused the rutting phenomenon during one-way motion, based on the movement of aggregates as viewed from the right-angle direction to the loading. Therefore, the rutting phenomenon including the deformation in the transverse direction can be analyzed by <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests based on one-way motion, or reciprocating motion, using the conventional <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> test. However, in the case of rutting during one-way motion with braking, the movement of aggregates in the wheel direction caused by tire friction was larger than movement in the depth direction. The inside of the asphalt mixture was dragged by tire friction in the wheel direction. Therefore, at locations where brake operation is frequently needed, the rutting phenomenon caused by flow and abrasion will be greater. 室外で作製した細粒度ギャップアスファルト混合物（ 13 F）に関して，往復走行，一方向走行およびブレーキ走行が可能なホイールトラッキング（WT）試験機を用いて，ホイールトラッキング試験中における内部の骨材の動きの違いを明らかにした。解析結果より，ホイールトラッキング試験による走行荷重直下のわだち掘れは往復走行より一方向走行の方が大きくなり，側方部の隆起は往復走行では荷重端部の右側で生じ，一方向走行では荷重端部から 50 mm程度離れた箇所に生じた。また，荷重直角方向の骨材の動きより，往復走行では圧密によるわだち掘れが主であり，一方向走行では流動によるわだち掘れが主であることが明らかとなった。この結果から，WT試験は往復走行とともに，実際のアスファルト舗装と同様の走行方法である一方向走行も行うことが，横断方向への変形も含めたわだち掘れ現象の解明につながると考えられる。ブレーキ走行を行った結果より，タイヤの摩擦による骨材の動きは鉛直下方向よりも走行方向の方が大きい。これは，タイヤの摩擦によりアスファルト混合物の内部が走行方向へ引きずられるためである。よって，車両のブレーキ操作が頻繁に必要となる場所では，流動によるわだち掘れおよび摩耗によるわだち掘れが生じると考えられる...|$|R
