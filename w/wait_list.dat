40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a series of model simulations on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for residential care of the mentally disabled in the Netherlands. The model assesses the number of mentally disabled in the Netherlands, the institutional and semi-institutional residential care and the <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for these types of care. Future developments in the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> are explored by means of studying scenarios showing the effects on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> of alternative forms of ambulatory care, a lower level of outflow from the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> an improved waiting-list registration and the increased survival of the mentally disabled population in residential care. The period 1996 - 2010 shows a {{growth in the number of}} mentally disabled in the Dutch population of 5. 0 % (from 104, 400 to 109, 700). In the subsequent years 2010 - 2020 the growth gradually decreases. There are increasing numbers of ageing mentally disabled persons: in the period 1996 - 2020, the number of mentally disabled over 65 years of age shows more than a doubling. In the reference scenario, based on developments in the 1996 - 1998 period, the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for residential care of the mentally disabled increases from over 6, 800 clients in 1996 to 8, 200 in 2000. After this year the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> decreases due to an assumed decreasing inflow into and a larger outflow from the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> partly because of a growing capacity of the institutions. The scenario home-care describes the situation in which after 2002 provision of suitable alternative ambulatory care reduces the inflow into the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> by 38 %. As a result, the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> decreases rapidly to 3, 000 in 2010 and less than 1, 000 in 2020. The scenario less outflow takes a variant assumption on the unspecified fraction of the outflow data in the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> registration, resulting in a reduced outflow to other care than institutional and semi-institutional residential care. In this scenario, the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> increases to 10, 900 in 2007, after which a decrease follows to 9, 600 in 2020. The scenario clean <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> assumes, based on actual data from a regional investigation, that the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> has a 20 % over-registration. In this scenario the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> develops from 5, 500 in 1996 to a maximum of 6, 800 in 1999. After this year the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> decreases to 4, 600 in 2010 and 3, 500 in 2020. Finally, in the scenario improved survival the mortality rates of the mentally disabled in the institutions in the period 2000 - 2020 are assumed to be reduced by 10 %. As a result, the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> increases to 8, 200 clients in 2000. After this year the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> decreases to 4, 900 clients in 2020. In order to make more accurate projections of possible bottlenecks in providing appropriate care for the mentally disabled, it is important to update the estimate of the number of mentally handicapped in the population and to improve the waiting-list registration and the quality of semi-institutional registration.

2500|$|About half {{of colleges}} use a <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> {{particularly}} those that accept {{fewer than half of}} all applications. Since students on average tend to be sending out more applications, colleges have been having a tougher time knowing for certain whether the students to whom they have offered admission will, in fact, attend in the fall. Some of the uncertainty is related to the phenomenon of students applying to more and more schools, sometimes 15 or more, to increase their chances in a statistical sense, but this adds a new layer of guesswork for colleges trying to predict how many accepted students will say yes, and puts waitlisted students in [...] "limbo" [...] or the [...] "basic equivalent of purgatory," [...] according to US News. In addition, many colleges lose some students due to a phenomenon sometimes called summer melt, meaning that some students, even ones who have sent in a deposit, will not show up in the fall, and melt away, and this [...] "melt percentage" [...] can be as high as 5% to 10% of persons who have paid a deposit.|$|E

A former dean of admissions at Franklin and Marshall College suggests that students not view the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> letter as a [...] "polite denial" [...] but rather as a possible opportunity. A second report in 2011 confirmed this, and it {{suggested that}} private colleges without [...] "billion-dollar endowments or 40,000 applicants" [...] were finding that the period from May to the start of classes in fall was a time of uncertainty, with many institutions seeking new applicants, and unsure how many of the applicants that had promised to attend would, in fact, show up in the fall. What can happen is that institutions {{at the top of the}} [...] "food chain" [...] accept students from their wait lists, and these students in turn sacrifice their deposit to schools lower down the chain, generating vacancies and uncertainty. A downside to wait lists is that by the time a student is accepted, there may be much less money available for scholarships or grants. There was a report in The Wall Street Journal of a few colleges, such as Franklin & Marshall, that deliberately waitlisted overqualified students on the assumption that, even if accepted, they would almost certainly not enroll. The alleged purpose was to boost the admissions yield rateââthe percentage of students who accept a college's admissions offerââas a means to improve the college's overall performance on the influential US News college rankings.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} how {{the composition of}} the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for postmortem kidney transplant has developed, and whether the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> reflects actual demand. DESIGN: Retrospective research and cohort study. METHOD: We used data from the period 2000 - 2014 from the Dutch Transplant Foundation, 'RENINE' and Eurotransplant. This concerned data on postmortem kidney donation, live donor transplants, the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and kidney transplantation. RESULTS: The postmortem kidney transplant <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> included transplantable (T) and non-transplantable (NT) patients. The number of T-patients declined from 1271 in 2000 to 650 in 2014, and the median waiting time between the start of dialysis and postmortem kidney transplant decreased from 4. 1 years in 2006 to 3. 1 years in 2014. The total number of patients on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> however, increased from 2263 in 2000 to 2560 in 2014 and in the same period the number of new patient registrations increased from 772 to 1212. In about 80 % of the NT-patients the reason for their NT status was not registered. A cohort analysis showed that NT-patients have a 2 -times lower chance of a postmortem kidney transplant and a 2 -times higher chance of leaving the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> without transplantation or of live-donor transplantation. CONCLUSION: The demand for donor kidneys remains high. The increased number of transplants resulted in a declining <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for T-patients while the total <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> is getting longer. <b>Waiting</b> <b>list</b> registration and maintenance need to be improved, to give better insight into the real demand...|$|R
40|$|Background: In lung {{transplantation}} (LTx), {{allocation of}} donor lungs is usually based on blood group, height and waiting time. Long waiting times favor {{patients with a}} slowly progressive end-stage lung disease and make the current allocation system the subject of discussion. In an attempt to equalize the chances for transplantation for every patient, irrespective of diagnosis, we investigated the effect of diagnosis-dependent prioritization on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> using a simulation model. Methods: For the main disease categories on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> the relative risks of dying while on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> were calculated using empirical data from the Dutch LTx program gathered {{over a period of}} 10 years. In a microsimulation model of the Dutch LTx program based on data from the actual situation, patients with diagnoses associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death while on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> were prioritized by multiplying the time on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> by the relative risk. Results: Relative risks of death on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> were increased significantly in patients with cystic fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Prioritization resulted in an increased chance of transplantation for the prioritized diagnoses and a decreased chance for the non-prioritized diagnoses. The distribution of diagnoses after LTx was almost equal to the distribution of diagnoses on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> Conclusion: The simulated method of prioritization on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> is a step forward to a more equitable allocation of donor lungs. Moreover, this method is clinically feasible, as long as the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> is updated frequently...|$|R
40|$|Hospital <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> are {{a feature}} of public health care {{services}} that result when demand appears to exceed supply, and serve as mechanisms to ration health care resources. While <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> are usually conceptualised as rational queues, the dynamics of <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> especially radiology <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> are more complex and still poorly understood. The present study has attempted to better understand a problematic <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> by adopting a systems approach known as boundary critique. A case study of an ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> was undertaken in which in-depth and semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a variety of stakeholders. Viewing the ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> systemically highlighted the role that a radiologist boundary surrounding the detection and confirmation of abnormal pathology played in constructing the ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> as a problem. This boundary was enacted through the process of double scanning, a symbol of radiologist expertise. General practitioners and patients employed a wider boundary, which focused on the management of clinical uncertainty. When the system in focus was widened to include this boundary, the process of double scanning became problematic. Double scanning contributed to the growth of the ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and exacerbated the difficulty faced by general practitioners and waiting patients in managing diagnostic uncertainty. To manage the tension created between radiologist and general practice boundaries, non-radiologist stakeholders undertook unrecognised and under-valued work that helped maintain the radiologist-centred systems of process and structure. Radiologists also employed a discourse of inappropriateness that downplayed the significance of delayed general practitioner referrals, which served to reinforce the primacy of the radiologist boundary. Conflicting boundaries highlighted that the ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> was managed in a way that did not act in the interests of non-radiologist stakeholders such as general practitioners and waiting patients. Stakeholders proposed a number of interventions to manage the growing ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> However, these primarily served to further strengthen the radiologist boundary and viewed as such represented a narrow improvement in terms of the interests of non-radiologist stakeholders. The process of boundary critique helped to reframe the ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> in terms of radiologist dominance. Interventions based on the boundary judgements of general practitioners, waiting patients and sonographers were developed. The present study argues that the ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> can be better understood in terms of the role that boundary judgements play in constructing notions such as expertise, illness and appropriateness, which underlie a common-sense understanding of need, demand and supply...|$|R
