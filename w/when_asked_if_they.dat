5|$|Berryman's Duntroon {{class had}} not yet {{completed}} its military training. Major General William Throsby Bridges decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he assigned the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), rather than as staff officers. Cadets were given the choice of service in the infantry or light horse. One cadet, Lawrence Wackett, protested that he wished {{to serve in the}} technical services. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would prefer the technical services, twelve cadets, including Berryman, Beavis, Clowes, Vasey, and Wackett stepped forward. Berryman was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Permanent Military Forces (PMF) on 29 June 1915 and again in the First AIF on 1 July 1915. He was posted to Lieutenant Colonel Harold Grimwade's 4th Field Artillery Brigade of the 2nd Division Artillery, along with Vasey and Milford. Berryman embarked for Egypt with the 4th Field Artillery Brigade on the transport Wiltshire on 17 November 1915. In Egypt, Berryman briefly commanded the 4th Brigade Ammunition Column before it was absorbed into the 2nd Division Ammunition Column.|$|E

500|$|Live Undead is {{the first}} live album by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was {{released}} through Metal Blade Records and recorded in New York City {{in front of a}} room of people. It has been questioned by both critics and authors that the audience sound {{may or may not be}} faked.

500|$|Veltmann and {{his team}} talked to the accused men prior to the trial to prepare their defense. They {{discovered}} {{that not all of}} the 50 were experienced ship loaders. Two of the men taken to the brig had never before loaded ammunitionthey were permanently assigned as cooks because of physical conditions making them unsuited to loading.

Another of the 50, who had a broken wrist in a sling was also asked if he would load ammunition, to which he replied that he would not. More importantly, Veltmann sensed that the men had not conspired to seize command from their superior officers. In a pre-trial brief, Veltmann cited the definition of mutiny from Winthrop's Military Law and Precedents and asked that the mutiny charges be dismissed as the formal charges against the 50 men failed to allege that they conspired together deliberately to [...] "usurp, subvert or override superior military authority". Coakley opposed with a brief stating that, under military law, a persistent refusal to work by two or more mensomething that might be called a [...] "strike" [...] among civilianswas sufficient proof of a conspiracy to override superior military authority and was equivalent to mutiny. Osterhaus agreed with Coakley and refused Veltmann's motion; the trial would proceed as planned.|$|E

Latoya Peterson of Spin observed that feminism was being loudly maligned in music {{at the time of the}} song's release, as a result, more female artists like TLC, Salt-N-Pepa and Tori Amos began to [...] "overtly defend themselves." [...] <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were getting inspired from Radiohead's 1992 track with the same name, the group denied this.

The idea, however, was considered to be quite [...] "controversial." [...] According to Thomas, the theme didn't come as much of a shock for them, she stated: [...] "I think when we first came out, it was very bold of us to have a song called 'Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg' with [...] 'Two inches or a yard, rock hard or if it's sagging'.
