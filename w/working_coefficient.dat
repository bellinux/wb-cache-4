The optical and absorption characteristics of the oxides are strongly dependent on the oxygen flow rate during the reactive magnetron sputtering process.

40|$|The Arnoldi {{method for}} {{standard}} eigenvalue problems possesses several attractive properties making it robust, reliable and efficient for many problems. Our first important {{result is a}} characterization of a general nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP) as a standard but infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem involving an integration operator denoted B. In this paper we present a new algorithm equivalent to the Arnoldi method for the operator B. Although the abstract construction is infinite dimensional, {{it turns out that}} we can carry out the iteration in an exact way (without approximation) by using only standard linear algebra operations involving matrices (not operators). This is achieved by <b>working</b> with <b>coefficients</b> in a basis of scalar functions, typically polynomials. Due {{to the fact that the}} constructed method has a complete equivalence with the standard Arnoldi method, it also inherits many of its attractive properties. Another somewhat unexpected consequence of the construction is that the matrix of basis vectors should be expanded not only in the way done in standard Arnoldi. We expand the matrix of basis vectors not only with a column to the right, but also a block row below. We also show that the method can be interpreted as the standard Arnoldi method if applied to the generalized eigenvalue problem resulting from the spectral discretization of the operator. With this equivalence we reach a recommendation on how the scalar product should be chosen for an important class of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. nrpages: 25 status: publishe...|$|R

This is illustrated using a paddle stirrer positioned above flat disc membranes with regular arrays of pores of 20 μm diameter and spacing between the pores of 80 and 200 μm. In the former case an additional mechanism for drop detachment is the push-off force, which is determined by the geometry of the drops as they deform at the membrane surface.
