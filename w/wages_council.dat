2500|$|Since 1998, the United Kingdom has fixed a {{national}} minimum wage, and sets outer limits on working time for virtually all workers. Direct wage and working time regulation is a comparatively recent phenomenon, {{as it was}} traditionally left to collective bargaining to achieve [...] "a fair day's wage for a fair day's work". The Truck Acts were the earliest wage regulations whose provisions have survived, requiring workment to be paid in money, and not kind. Now, the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 13 stipulates that employers can only dock employees’ wages (e.g. for missing stock) if the employee has consented to deductions in writing. This, however, does not cover industrial action, so following 18th century common law on part performance of work, employees who refused to 3 out of 37 hours a week in minor workplace disobedience, had their pay cut for the full 37. From the Trade Boards Act 1909, the UK had set minimum wages according to {{the specific needs of}} different sectors of work. But this system was eroded through the 1980s and eventually repealed in 1993.

5000|$|The Trade Boards Act 1909 created four Trades Boards {{that set}} minimum wages which varied between {{industries}} {{for a number}} of sectors where [...] "sweating" [...] was generally regarded as a problem and where collective bargaining was not well established. This system was extended considerably after the Second World War; in 1945 Trades Boards became <b>Wages</b> <b>Councils,</b> which set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy, including the service sector as well as manufacturing. <b>Wages</b> <b>Councils</b> were finally abolished in 1993, having fallen into decline due, in large part, to Trades Union opposition. A lower limit of pay, or [...] "pay floor" [...] was regarded as threatening the voluntary system of collective bargaining favoured in the UK.

40|$|Debate {{about the}} effect of minimum wages on {{employment}} in the United Kingdom has not paid much attention to the impact of the existing system of minimum wages, the <b>Wages</b> <b>Council.</b> In this paper, we look at the consequences of the declining importance of the <b>Wages</b> <b>Council</b> in the 1980 s for wage inequality and employment in the covered industries.
