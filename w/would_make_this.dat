By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other; however, the Phillies {{retained}} a half game lead. Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries. By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead, but only to two and a half games.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} {{nature of}} past eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera {{suggests that this}} volcano poses a significant long-distance threat to communities across Canada. A large explosive eruption can produce large amounts of ash that could significantly affect communities across Canada. Ash columns could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> a hazard for air traffic along the coastal airway between Vancouver and Alaska. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems. In addition, pyroclastic fall could also have a deleterious effect on the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield surrounding the volcano. Melting of glacial ice could cause lahars or debris flows. This in turn could endanger water supplies on the Machmell River and other local water sources.|$|E
5|$|Charles X of Sweden had {{concluded}} the earlier war with Denmark with a stunning victory by succeeding in the bold March across the Belts. Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} into a humiliating peace in the Treaty of Roskilde in which Denmark had to cede Scania, Halland and Blekinge on the Scandinavian Peninsula and the island of Bornholm, and Norway lost the provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag. Europe {{was stunned by the}} quick victory, and Charles proudly publicized his accomplishments. However, peace meant new problems. In the peace treaty of Roskilde, Denmark was obliged to supply the Swedish army with provisions until May 1658, but soon thereafter the army would need to be moved. The Swedish king knew that the army {{would not be able to}} be supplied in Sweden for long, and disbanding it was not desirable with the Poles eager to revenge the 1655 invasion of Poland. Sweden was not in want of enemies to attack: campaigns in Livonia and Estonia were considered, but were rejected due to supply problems. The Swedish King maintained that his main goal was to invade Royal Prussia, but he also wanted to punish Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia. The many enemies in continental Europe, among them Poland and a hostile Dutch <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> a difficult endeavor however. A new attack on Prussia would also see little international support, France was already urging peace. The surprising Swedish solution to this dilemma would be to return to Denmark in an attempt to finish the job.|$|E

Working under Goldcrest also afforded director Don Bluth freer rein over the development of the story than under Amblin and Spielberg.|$|E

On 8 April 2005, Khatami sat near Iranian-born Israeli President Moshe Katsav during {{the funeral of}} Pope John PaulII because of alphabetical order. Later, Katsav shook hands and spoke with Khatami. Katsav himself is in origin an Iranian Jew, and from a part of Iran close to Khatami's home; he stated that they had spoken about their home province.

Another goal was that the G-58 (Grumman's design designation for the aircraft) {{should be able to}} operate from escort carriers, which were then limited to the obsolescent F4F Wildcat as the Grumman F6F Hellcat was too large and heavy. A small, lightweight aircraft <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> possible.

25|$|This almost-correct {{molecule}} {{possesses a}} tricyclic guanidine group (rings A, B & C), {{along with a}} uracil ring (D). The zwitterionic nature of the molecule makes this highly water-soluble, {{as the presence of}} charged areas within the molecule creates a dipole effect, suiting the polar solvent. Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR spectrum to small changes in pH suggested that the uracil ring exists in a keto/enol tautomeric relationship, where a hydrogen transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2). It was originally proposed that a hydrogen bond between the uracil and guanidine groups in the enol tautomer <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> the dominant form.|$|E

25|$|ND {{introduced}} the marketing concept ND-SAFE in 1982, {{where the company}} focused on the scalability of the systems. Except for the municipal and university sectors, ND did not attempt at market segmentation to capture customers within a specific industry; this often {{made it difficult to}} sell as clients often found it difficult to purchase from a non-niche manufacturer. For instance, ND attempted to sell to the Scandinavian banking market; they were asked by clients if they <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> a prioritized market, but ND responded that they only would if they received sufficient sales. The answer caused the banking industry to go elsewhere for its products, despite an initial enthusiasm for ND's products.|$|E
25|$|On August 2021, Pope withdrew to {{the line}} of the Rappahannock River. He was aware of Lee's plan because a Union cavalry raid {{captured}} a copy of the written order. Stuart was almost captured during this raid; his cloak and plumed hat did not escape, however, and Stuart retaliated on August 22 with a raid on Pope's headquarters at Catlett's Station, capturing the Union commander's dress coat. Stuart's raid demonstrated that the Union right flank was vulnerable to a turning movement, although river flooding brought on by heavy rains <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> difficult. It also revealed the plans for reinforcing Pope's army, which would eventually bring it to the strength of 130,000 men, more than twice the size of the Army of Northern Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Decoration {{for these}} first stone domes was {{initially}} the same external ribbing as earlier brick domes, and such brick domes {{would continue to}} be built throughout the Mamluk period, but more elaborate patterns of carving were introduced through the beginning of the sixteenth century. Early stones domes were plastered externally when not cut precisely enough, but improvements in technique over time <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> unnecessary. Spiral ribs were developed in the 1370s and zigzag patterns were common both {{by the end of the}} fourteenth century and again at the end of the fifteenth century. In the fifteenth century, interlaced star and floral designs were used in a tiled pattern. The uniqueness of a pattern on a mausoleum dome helped to associate that dome with the individual buried there.|$|E

25|$|CHAPTERS VII to XXXI, inclusive, {{are devoted}} to the {{explanation}} and illustration of the various forms which may be introduced in a manufacturing business.

No one form is adaptable to all lines of manufacture or accounting, and even in the same line of business the same form cannot be used successfully in every instance, as the volume of business, the conditions of manufacture, and the policy of the management, so far as the plan of organization is involved, <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> impracticable...|$|E
25|$|The Act {{also changed}} the court rules on the {{submission}} of evidence. The Civil Justice Review {{found that many}} cases which {{could easily have been}} settled before the hearings in court were not, primarily because there was no way of assessing the strength of the other side's arguments and their evidence. The Civil Justice Review suggested that forcing parties to provide evidence and witness statements to the other side before the case came to court <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> assessment easier, and would lead to the parties settling their case before it came to court if one side was at an obvious disadvantage. This suggestion was accepted, and included in the Act, which says that each party must produce written statements of any oral evidence they intend to present in court, and that these statements should be given to the other party before the case comes to court. Any party who fails to comply with this may be refused leave to present this oral evidence in court. A similar system had been used in the Chancery Division, Admiralty Court and Commercial Court since 1986.|$|E

Often, he would vomit as he dissected the bodies, before wrapping the dismembered limbs inside plastic bags and carrying the remains to the bonfires. Nonetheless, immediately prior to his dissecting the victims' bodies, Nilsen would engage in masturbation as he knelt or sat alongside the corpse. This, he stated, was his symbolic gesture of saying goodbye to his victims.|$|E
