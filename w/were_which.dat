5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his carriers <b>were,</b> <b>which</b> actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
5|$|José Antonio Estudillo died in 1852, and {{his family}} stayed until 1887, when they moved to Los Angeles, leaving {{the house in the}} hands of a caretaker. Meanwhile, the 1884 {{publication}} of Ramona, a novel set in Southern California which painted a romanticized portrait of Californio life, generated a nationwide interest in the region. This, combined with the opening of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railway lines (and the ensuing rate war, which drove prices down to as low as $1 from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles), meant that hordes of tourists made their way to Southern California to see the locations in the novel. Unfortunately, Jackson died in 1885 without ever having disclosed what the actual locations in the novel <b>were,</b> <b>which</b> caused a great deal of speculation.|$|E

25|$|In these {{double-blind}} experiments, {{neither the}} participants nor the researchers know which participants {{belong to the}} control group, nor the test group. Only after all data have been recorded (and, in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which participants <b>were</b> <b>which.</b> Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion can greatly lessen the power of preconceived notions or physical cues (e.g., the placebo effect, observer bias, experimenter's bias) to distort the results (by making researchers or participants behave differently from in everyday life). Random assignment of test subjects to the experimental and control groups is {{a critical part of}} any double-blind research design. The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third party, and is not revealed to the researchers until the study is over.|$|E

2500|$|Tyrwhitt ordered four destroyers {{to detach}} and attack G-194. The sound of firing alerted the {{remaining}} German destroyers, {{who had been}} moving north, but turned south towards home. Before they could complete the turn, they were sighted by British destroyers who commenced firing. The trailing destroyer V-1 was hit, followed by the destroyer-minesweepers D-8 and T-33. G-9 called for fire against the attacking ships from coastal artillery, but the mist meant the artillery were unable to determine which ships <b>were</b> <b>which.</b> At 07:26, Tyrwhitt turned east, attempting to follow the sound of gunfire and his four destroyers. He sighted 10 German destroyers which he chased through increasing mist for 30 minutes until the ships reached Heligoland and {{he was forced to}} turn away. At 07:58, Stettin and Frauenlob arrived, reversing the situation so that the British destroyers were obliged to retreat toward their own cruisers Arethusa and Fearless. Stettin withdrew, since the German destroyers had now escaped, but Frauenlob was engaged by Arethusa. While Arethusa was theoretically the better-armed ship, two of her four [...] guns were jammed, while another was damaged by fire.
