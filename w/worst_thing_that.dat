It tells the bittersweet {{story of the}} 1981 Sondheim-Furth-Prince flop Merrily We Roll Along using both film footage taken during rehearsal for the original Broadway production, and new interviews with its cast and creators.|$|E
25|$|In a 2011 New Yorker article, {{journalist}} Jane Mayer {{wrote that}} Drake felt the NSA was committing serious crimes against the American people, {{on a level}} worse than what President Nixon had done in the 1970s. Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and decided that if he revealed unclassified information to a reporter, then the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> would happen to him was probably {{that he would be}} fired.|$|E
500|$|Nina Leen took twelve pictures, {{of which}} one {{appeared}} in Life. Barnett Newman {{had insisted that}} the group be photographed like bankers. The artists were allowed to position themselves. Hedda Sterne, who had arrived late, {{is seen in the}} back (standing on a table). She is the only woman in the photograph and would later describe the experience as [...] "probably the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happened to me". Painter Lee Krasner believed Sterne was allowed at the insistence of art dealer Betty Parsons, who represented many in the group.|$|E

50|$|To {{discourage}} dueling, the Massachusetts General Court also imposed dissection as {{a threat}} by ruling that anyone who {{died as a result}} of a duel would be sentenced to post-mortem dissection and dismemberment. Dissection was seen as perhaps one of the <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> could happen to a person after their death.|$|R
500|$|O'Malley faced initial {{difficulties}} {{based on}} race, {{as a community}} leader stated that his entrance into the race [...] "created some tension," [...] and that O'Malley's potential victory [...] "would be the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could happen in this city" [...] and could [...] "tear this city apart." [...] Some saw his entrance in the race {{as an attempt to}} split the African American vote. However, O'Malley received endorsements from prominent African American politicians in August, including Rawlings, fellow state Delegate Kenneth Montague, and Conway. Rawlings credited O'Malley's [...] "track record of empowering black Americans." [...] He also received an endorsement from Schaefer. Some African Americans charged Rawlings with [...] "stabbing us in the back" [...] over the endorsement.|$|E
500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is}} that this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{opposed the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), the {{landmark}} {{campaign finance reform}} law. In 2001, during {{the debate on the}} bill, Hastert criticized Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, saying that McCain had [...] "bullied" [...] House Republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaign-finance reform proposals. Hastert called the legislation [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ever happened to Congress" [...] and expressed the view that there were [...] "constitutional flaws" [...] in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{most often}} used in cases where program {{material}} comes to an unexpected halt, either through operator error or for technical reasons. Among professional broadcasters, dead air {{is considered one of}} the <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can occur. Moreover, having dead air during commercial segments or sponsor announcements can cost networks considerable revenue.|$|R

Caption: "The first thing Shawn Davis did after {{arriving}} in town was not feel good, which prompted a doctor to give him a shot where doctors invariably prefer to give shots. Without question this has {{to be one of the}} very <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can occur in the life of a bronc - rider, whose livelihood is based on the ability to remain seated under the most adverse conditions. ...|$|R
5000|$|Pressburger began {{a career}} as a journalist. After working in Hungary and Germany he turned to screenwriting in the late 1920s, working for UFA in Berlin (having moved there in 1926). The rise of the Nazis forced him to flee to Paris, where he again worked as screenwriter, and then to London. He later said, [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{happened}} to me were the political consequences of events beyond my control ... the best things were exactly the same." ...|$|R
500|$|Pablo is tall (...) , {{good in the}} air, and as {{a younger}} player was noted for his pace. Albacete {{teammate}} Miquel Buades suggested that those key attributes made him [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could happen to a forward". His coach at both Albacete and Atlético, César Ferrando, said {{he had all the}} qualities needed for his position, which included anticipation and the intelligence to keep things simple. Again according to Ferrando, Pablo rarely fouled, because [...] "he doesn't need to. He has a whole arsenal of defensive resources." [...] A 2006 World Cup profile suggested he was [...] "much happier on the ball than first impressions may suggest", and could look [...] "ungainly". A scout's assessment of his running style as [...] "ugly" [...] reportedly discouraged Real Madrid from pursuing an early interest in him.|$|E
500|$|Hed PE {{signed with}} Jive Records, {{releasing}} their self-titled debut album in 1997. In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and {{we thought it would be}} cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could have happened. [...] We've had offers from Sony and others that we can't take because we owe Jive so much money." ...|$|E
500|$|As well as {{his work}} {{alongside}} Webb, Mitchell has appeared on his own in several shows. He played technical expert Owen in the Radio 4 sitcom Think the Unthinkable in 2001. He played the surgeon Dr Toby Stephens in the BBC2 sitcom Doctors and Nurses. In 2005 he played Kate's hapless secretary Tim in the BBC's updating of The Taming of The Shrew in its ShakespeaRe-Told series. Mitchell appeared as various roles on the Channel 4 sketch programme Blunder. The show was not well received, with the British Sitcom Guide naming it as the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Mitchell did in all of 2006 in their [...] "British Sitcom Awards" [...] of that year. He portrayed the recurring character of Dr. James Vine in the BBC sitcom Jam and Jerusalem. Mitchell had a small part in the film I Could Never Be Your Woman, playing an English writer, also named David. While in Los Angeles to record the part {{he decided that he}} did not like the area much, and preferred filming in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Altogether 20,057 Jews {{from the}} Reich were {{deported}} to Riga. By February 10, 1942, only 15,000 remained alive. Many had been simply murdered upon arrival; how this had occurred {{was not known}} to the people arriving on later transport. [...] According to German ghetto survivor Gertrude Schneider, {{the inhabitants of the}} ghetto did not realize how many German Jews had been killed following deportation. [...] They remained under the impression that deportation and forced labor were the <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were going to happen: ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 5, 1966, a {{group of}} 75 people {{associated}} with the company were among the 113 passengers and 11 crew members who died when BOAC Flight 911 crashed near Mount Fuji, Japan. Company executives and their top dealers were on a 14-day company sponsored tour of Japan and Southeast Asia, organized {{as a reward for}} sales performance. A company spokesman, quoted in the press in reaction to the tragedy, said that [...] "this has got {{to be one of the}} <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> a company can experience." ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{year later}} {{he left to}} join fellow Ecuadorian team Deportivo Quito. Moves to Gimnasia, Chiapas, Ferro Carril Oeste and Belgrano {{followed}} between 2003 and 2007. In 2004, Campodónico, playing for Ferro Carril Oeste scored twice against Sarmiento. Sarmiento's goalkeeper was Campodónico's own brother, Pablo. Mariano told reporters that [...] "this was the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> {{happened to me in}} my football career". In 2006, while playing for Belgrano, Campodónico was sentenced to eight days in prison for making [...] "obscene gestures" [...] at the opposing team during a football game.|$|R
500|$|The {{sources are}} {{inconsistent}} regarding {{the extent of}} the persecution in Constantius's domain, though all portray it as quite limited. Lactantius states that the destruction of church buildings was the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> came to pass. Eusebius explicitly denies that any churches were destroyed in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Life of Constantine, but lists Gaul as an area suffering from the effects of the persecution in his Martyrs of Palestine. A group of bishops declared that [...] "Gaul was immune" [...] (immunis est Gallia) from the persecutions under Constantius. The death of Saint Alban, the first British Christian martyr, was once dated to this era, but most now assign it to the reign of Septimius Severus. The second, third and fourth edicts seem not to have been enforced in the West at all. It is possible that Constantius's relatively tolerant policies were the result of Tetrarchic jealousies; the persecution, after all, had been the project of the Eastern emperors, not the Western ones. After Constantine succeeded his father in 306, he urged the recovery of Church property lost in the persecution, and legislated full freedom for all Christians in his domain.|$|E
500|$|In his mature works El Greco {{demonstrated}} a characteristic tendency to dramatize {{rather than to}} describe. The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard {{the laws of nature}} and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another [...] "because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can happen to a figure'". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso.|$|E
500|$|The Kids' WB {{version of}} the Cardcaptors dub was panned by critics. Jake Godek of THEM Anime called it [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has ever {{happened}} to anime that had a good Japanese name," [...] with the dubbing being [...] "one of the worst if not the worst dubbing done for a program." [...] He also criticized the editing, saying that it had [...] "demolished the plot" [...] and noting that it cut out vital character backgrounds {{needed in order to}} understand the show. Adam Arnold of Animefringe, reviewing the first Cardcaptors DVD, said it was [...] "nothing more than an attempt to dilute a fan favorite anime," [...] with the dubbed voices described as [...] "not up-to-par with the originals." [...] The ordering of the episodes on the DVD was also criticized, noting that starting with episode eight meant that the cast are [...] "left without their backgrounds fleshed out." [...] However, he also approved of the episode stories being left intact, and praised the voices of Carly McKillip as Sakura Avalon and Rhys Huber as Syaoran Li, stating that they were [...] "only voices that really shine above the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> further <b>that</b> {{was said}} that night, when she had {{reported}} as much of Valetta's confidence as she thought might soften displeasure, was Aunt Ada's observation: 'Maura! That's the White child, is it not? No doubt it was the Greek blood.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a one-star rating, criticizing it heavily for its {{portrayal}} of teenage sex: [...] "The archness of their 'innocence' toward sex is, finally, just plain dirty. And the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> the movie seems {{to like it}} that way." ...|$|R
60|$|MR. BARLOW. One panders to the system--one panders to the system. And so, you see, {{the problem}} is too much. One man cannot alter or affect the system; he can only {{sacrifice}} himself to it. Which is the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> probably <b>that</b> he can do.|$|R
500|$|The {{scenes that}} {{featured}} Rachel's party were acclaimed by most reviewers. Fallon called them [...] "a parade {{of the funniest}} sight gags, most uninhibited acting, and—interestingly enough—most relatable scenes Glee has produced in a while", and described Michele as [...] "an acting stand out" [...] who [...] "handled the entire arc like a seasoned comedienne". His colleague Meghan Brown said it [...] "showed Glee at its best", and added: [...] "The dialogue was snappy, the group dynamic was clean and specific, and the kids seemed like actual kids." [...] VanDerWerff {{also pointed out that}} the club members [...] "really felt like kids, not like miniature 30-somethings", and said the party was the [...] "best part" [...] of the episode. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised Finn's breakdown of [...] "the five drunk girl archetypes, as demonstrated by the glee girls". Harper wrote that the party scenes [...] "left a lot to be desired", and Patrick Burns, the third reviewer from The Atlantic, [...] "waited for the Glee party to get out of control, or for someone to get hurt so that America's youth could be shocked and appalled by the dangers of drinking", but [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happened was that Rachel tried to flip a gay guy".|$|E
500|$|Shiamak Davar choreographed {{the dance}} {{sequence}} of [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] {{and was given}} free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers. Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product {{up to them to}} avoid a choreographed appearance. Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] Ram Madhvani took over as director for [...] "Bheja Kum". The latter sequence, containing a [...] "fun-filled" [...] song of rhythmic dialogue, allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages. It was intended to represent [...] "a young boy's worst nightmare, in terms of... the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he can think of"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of [...] "creepy-crawlies" [...] such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards. Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English. The chalkboard writing's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and [...] "end the song on a high note." ...|$|E
500|$|Although widely acclaimed, {{the album}} has been censured by some. It was voted the worst record ever {{made in a}} 1998 Melody Maker poll of pop stars, DJs and journalists. Among the harshest detractors was {{musician}} and journalist John Robb, who described the album as [...] "the benchmark of 1967 – the low water point of rock 'n' roll". In a scathing appraisal of the record prior to its 40th anniversary in 2007, Guardian critic Richard Smith wrote that it is [...] "if not the worst, then certainly the most overrated album of all time". He {{also said that the}} [...] "excruciating" [...] LP was often ranked by members of the music press as the best ever due to affection for its cultural impact, and [...] "not because of anything intrinsically great about the record". Asked in 2007 to nominate the [...] "supposedly great" [...] album he would [...] "gladly never hear again", artist and writer Billy Childish named Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, saying that it [...] "signalled the death of rock 'n' roll". Musician and author Bill Drummond, in a 2010 publication, called the record [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ever happened to music". In 2015, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards denounced the album as [...] "a mishmash of rubbish, kind of like Satanic Majesties".|$|E
5000|$|On 23 June 2015 The Guardian {{newspaper}} {{published an}} article by Ian Gittins in which he put a satirical interpretation on the Macc Lads' lyrics {{and said that they}} had arrived [...] "too early" [...] in music history to not be taken at face value. The article stated that they were ultimately [...] "a coarse yet clever spoof". Muttley McLad himself rejected this description, saying [...] "There was no ulterior motive, The Guardian are reading too much into it. Making us out to be witty, intelligent satirists is probably the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that’s</b> ever been said about us." ...|$|R

5000|$|On 11 December 2009 after 11 {{straight}} {{wins and}} two defences of his belt Broadhurst lost to reigning British super flyweight champion Lee Haskins in a unification clash. The fight, in Newport Wales, saw Haskins become a double champion after scoring a unanimous decision over 12 scrappy rounds. Speaking of his disappointment at having {{lost for the}} first time Broadhurst claimed that it was [...] "one bad night" [...] told Boxing News [...] "I just stayed in my bed, depressed. It was one of the <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> has ever happened to me, it was like a family member had died or something - that is how bad it was".|$|R
2500|$|I {{thought it}} was {{absolutely}} the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could possibly hit, I mean worst. It was so unlike anything {{that it had to}} be incredible. It was new, it was something that wasn't being done. ... So try to imagine, in a small rehearsal studio, four guys are up there playing. In front of them are Bill, Neil, Joyce, and myself. They finished the first song and no applause. Gene (Simmons) walks down to Neil Bogart, grabs both of his hands, and makes him applaud ... and Neil started applauding because he was scared to death. And I said to myself at that moment, [...] "This I wanna be involved in" ... because that's the kind of balls you have to have to do anything.|$|E
2500|$|Vangelis {{once used}} digital {{sampling}} keyboard E-mu Emulator, {{and tried to}} use computer software for recording, but concluded its [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has happened for the performing musician". He deems it [...] "insufficient and slow" [...] for immediate and spontaneous creation and all his efforts [...] "are {{to stay away from}} that beast". He considers that the contemporary civilization is living in a cultural [...] "dark age" [...] of [...] "musical pollution". He considers musical composing a science rather than an art, similar to Pythagoreanism. He has a mystical viewpoint on music as [...] "one of the greatest forces in the universe", that the [...] "music exists before we exist". Some consider that his experience of music is a kind of synaesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Bill Moyers {{reported}} that PBS had obtained {{a copy of}} the [...] "game plan" [...] that was adopted by the industry's trade association, America's Health Insurance Plans which spelled out the industry strategies to [...] "Highlight horror stories of government-run systems." [...] Potter explained, [...] "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you're heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics {{for years and years and}} years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern." ...|$|E
5000|$|Campodónico {{began his}} career in 1997 with Temperley, with whom he stayed with for six years before joining Sarmiento in 2003 but only to return to Temperley two years later; however, he did win the 2003-04 Primera B Metropolitana while with Sarmiento. In 2004, Pablo conceded two goals in one match against his brother Mariano who {{describes}} it as [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> {{happened to me in}} my football career". Pablo and his brother later played together for Aldosivi when Mariano was with the club in 2009. In 2006, Campodónico left Temperley again as he agreed to join Platense. After a season with the club he departed to join Aldosivi. As {{of the end of the}} 2016 season he has made 286 league appearances for Aldosivi.|$|R
40|$|To {{write about}} the crisis that has befallen the economy is to repeat what {{everyone}} knows. The <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> the crisis has clouded our mind and stripped it of its composure and wisdom. In our passion for dividing things up and searching for the "philosopher's stone," we appear to have permanently forgotten the elemental political-economic truth that labor {{is the father of}} wealth and land is its mother. ...|$|R
500|$|In 2010, the {{character}} underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages. Kelly branded the storyline challenging, admitting {{she felt a}} huge responsibility to get it right, stating: [...] "It's definitely been the hardest thing I've done since I've been here. I think the responsibility to do it well that you feel is huge." [...] Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding: [...] "She can't really put up any barriers about this– it's the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> ever happened. She goes from being a girl to a woman, I think. I'm just devastated for her".
