Abu Nidal reportedly said of Lockerbie, according to Seale: [...] "We do have some involvement in this matter, but if anyone so much as mentions it, I will kill him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> hands!" [...] Seale writes that the ANO appeared to have no connection to it; one of Abu Nidal's associates told him, [...] "If an American soldier tripped in some corner of the globe, Abu Nidal would instantly claim it as his own work." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna's 1986 studio album True Blue was a {{critical}} and commercial success, spawning five top-five singles, and selling over eight million copies worldwide, by the year-end. However, her film career was not as successful as she had hoped it would be. Following the commercially successful Desperately Seeking Susan, her 1986 film Shanghai Surprise—where she starred with her then husband Sean Penn—was {{a critical}} and box-office failure, prompting Madonna to comment that she [...] "struggled {{to come to terms}} with her character in Shanghai Surprise, because the innocence and repressed personality I was required to portray was so at variance <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> character." [...] Continuing to struggle with her film career, Madonna was unsure of her ability to choose a good script, and film producers were less sure about backing her up.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld commented to {{her husband}} in 1773: [...] "For {{the early part of}} my life I {{converse}}d little <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> Sex. In the Village where I was, there was none to converse with." [...] Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin's memoir, what resulted was [...] "a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve" [...] in Barbauld's character. Barbauld was never quite comfortable with her identity as a woman and always believed that she {{failed to live up to}} the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would center around issues central to women and her [...] "outsider" [...] perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity during the eighteenth century.|$|E

500|$|Leto {{was largely}} an {{autodidact}} on drums; [...] "I've {{always wanted to}} find my way of doing things," [...] he explained, [...] "Discovering what I can contribute <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> voice. There were so many styles that I was into at a young age. I didn't want to get locked into just one thing." [...] During his youth, Leto had been a devoted fan of progressive rock and blues music, listening to artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Boz Scaggs. He is inspired by electronic music, including Depeche Mode and The Cure. His major influences also include jazz band Steely Dan, as well as heavy metal groups Mountain, Iron Maiden and Kiss. According to Leto, these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions. He explained that he [...] "never focused on the drummers," [...] saying that he felt more connected to music than a particular drummer.|$|E
500|$|Though Townsend {{was proud}} {{of what he had}} {{accomplished}} so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. [...] "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personality," [...] he later reflected. [...] "This combination was appalling." [...] He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music. [...] "I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve," [...] he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend {{received a phone call from}} an A representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as [...] "just noise".|$|E
500|$|Maximian {{retired to}} villas in Campania or Lucania. Their homes were distant from {{political}} life, but Diocletian and Maximian were {{close enough to}} remain in regular contact with each other. Galerius assumed the consular fasces in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at Carnuntum (Petronell-Carnuntum, Austria). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint Licinius to be augustus in place of Severus, who had died {{at the hands of}} Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation. Diocletian's reply: [...] "If you could show the cabbage that I planted <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed." ...|$|E
