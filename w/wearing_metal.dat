50|$|The Four Fords were {{a popular}} group of tap dancers {{in the early}} 1900s. The group {{was made up of}} four {{siblings}}, Max Ford, Edwin Ford, Dora Ford and Mabel Ford. They also had another brother named Jonny Ford, he was a dancer as well but never toured with his siblings (Watson). When the fords were children, they were taught to dance very early in their life (Mable Ford). They learned many different types of dancing. Their brother Jonny Ford toured as a ballroom dancer (Watson). The Four Ford became popular around 1910. In 1913 The Four Fords broke up, but Mable and Dora kept touring as the Ford Sisters. Max Ford also toured with Hetty Urma-Ford Max’s second wife (Watson). It is believed that after Max left The Four Fords he became a successful movie choreographer. The Fords clogged danced, tap danced, and soft shoe danced (An Art of Infinite Variety). With Clog dancing the dancers would wear wooden shoes with split soles (Kaiserman). The danced started in England, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany. Clog dancing was originally a folk dance, and was an early form of tap dancing because the dancers would make noise with their shoes. Around the 1900s soft-shoe dancing started, in the melting pot of America. Different Cultures brought their different styles of dance. It is believed that the African dance styles were mixed with European styles and became rhythmic and fluid (archive.itvs.org).Dancers didn’t start <b>wearing</b> <b>metal</b> at the bottom of their tap shoes until around 1910 (archive.itvs.org). The Four Fords started to become famous at this time as well. It was a revolutionary time for tap dancing, and Highbrow magazine even references it as “the birth of tap”. The Fords {{were in the midst of}} it all. They became celebrities of their time. The Fords were vaudeville dancers (Watson). This meant that they were often in humorous variety shows. The Vaudeville shows were popular from the 1910 to the 1930s when they were beat out by the film industry (Kaiserman).|$|E

5000|$|A {{redesigned}} female {{version of}} Copperhead appears in Batman: Arkham Origins voiced by Rosa Salazar. DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns {{has said that}} this new incarnation and daughter of Copperhead would appear as a villain in the New 52 [...] "after the game's release." [...] Copperhead is among the eight assassins that are hired by Black Mask to kill Batman. She is portrayed as a skilled contortionist and escape artist <b>wearing</b> <b>metal,</b> clawed gloves coated with a toxin that makes those she scratches experience intense hallucinations before dying. This version is also implied {{to be part of}} a group of South American assassins who all use the moniker [...] "Copperhead", as Batman is surprised that this Copperhead is a woman as previous versions were supposed to be male. Copperhead first appears in the Sionis Steel Mill, killing some of the Joker's men before attacking Batman as he interrogates Roman Sionis about Joker (who has been posing as Black Mask). Black Mask offers to pay Copperhead double Joker's rate for killing Batman, but Copperhead calls him a fallen king with no money stating that she knows about the Joker causing Black Mask to flee. Copperhead catches Batman by surprise and slips away after she slashes him with a hallucinogenic poison. While infected, Batman experiences visions of Alfred Pennyworth dismissing him as a failure, a female bank manager that Joker killed saying it was his fault for letting her die, and Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb saying he wasn't a real hero for letting him die. Copperhead later attacks him head-on using the toxin to its full advantage as Batman is forced to fight dozens of Copperhead illusions along with the original, fighting more and more Copperheads as the poison weakens him. Eventually, Alfred delivers a cure into the Steel Mill, allowing Batman to easily defeat her and throw her into one of the shipping containers. She tries to bargain for freedom by revealing that a meeting between all the assassins enlisted by [...] "Black Mask" [...] had been called, but Batman leaves her in the shipping yard anyway tracing the meeting using the electromagnetic pulse from Electrocutioner's gloves. Batman later tells Alfred to send an anonymous tip for Captain James Gordon about Copperhead's location. If the player listens in to corrupt cops, they say that Copperhead was put in a cell without bars to prevent her escape (most likely similar to the one Clayface would be put in years later).|$|E

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} <b>wear</b> <b>metals</b> in lubricating fluids {{is of great}} potential value in the proper maintainence {{of all types of}} machinery. Savings of both time and money {{have been reported in the}} military and civilian sectors following the implementation of routine <b>wear</b> <b>metal</b> screening in lubricating oils. Current methods are known to discriminate against metals present in the form of particulates. The first part of this dissertation focusses on the direct determination of <b>wear</b> <b>metals</b> in lubricating oils by atomic emission spectroscopy utilizing an inverted inductively coupled plasma as a source. Data are presented which show the effects of power and viewing position on the signal intensity of a variety of sized iron particulate samples in lubricating oil. The second part of this dissertation describes the characterization of a relatively new spectroscopic source [...] the dual inductively coupled plasma (DICP). The DICP increases the residence time of the analyte in the source by extending the physical length of the plasma discharge and providing two energy deposition regions. Emission intensity, electron density, ion-to-atom intensity ratios, and calculated temperatures are used to compare the DICP with standard inductively coupled plasmas recorded in the literature...|$|R

The JOAP results proved conclusively that increases in component wear could be confirmed by detecting corresponding increases in the <b>wear</b> <b>metal</b> content of the lubricating oil. In 1958 Pacific Intermountain Express (P.I.E.) was the first trucking company to set up an in-house used oil analysis laboratory to control vehicle maintenance costs which was managed by Bob Herguth.

40|$|Introduction: Braces is the {{treatment}} of choice for malocclusion. However, in recent years malocclusion no longer serves as the reason behind the orthodontic treatment. Many people use it for the fashion purposes {{and some of them}} got it from a dental quack. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand factors that influenced citizen of Bandung to go to dental quack practice for orthodontics treatment. Methods: Cross-sectional study with purposive sampling technique consisting of 30 samples. Inclusion criteria were subject <b>wearing</b> <b>metal</b> braces from dental quack, live within area of Bandung, and willing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria was subjects that refused to participate in the study. Results: The study showed that 73 % of the subjects use {{the treatment}} for aligning teeth over getting along with the trend or the perception of beauty from using colorful bracket rubber. 63 % chose a dental quack because of the suggestions from friends who had done it before them. Low income combined with the need for orthodontics treatment and inadequate information about dental braces influencing subjects choice to go to a dental quack. The study showed that socioeconomic environment highly influenced the decision to wear braces from a dental quack. Conclusion: The low price factor was the main reason for dental quack braces highly demanded. Common people need to be educated to get proper treatment for malocclusion and to go for improper provider of dental treatment...|$|E
40|$|The Main Objective of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the extent of external apical root resorption at the end of orthodontic treatment and to identify the possible pre-treatment and treatment factors that would allow to predict the possible incidence of root resorption before the start of treatment. Patients and Methods: Panoramic radiographs of 75 patients that had been treated with full fixed appliances were used to assess apical root resorption in maxillary incisors. The degree of root resorption was measured in millimetres and the scale of Shape was used. Results: The results showed that the resorption in the maxillary incisors is on the average 1. 5 mm, the severe resorption was seen in 2. 6 % of patients. The worst resorption was seen in teeth with abnormal root shape. There were no differences in the severity of root resorption when comparing males and females as well as children and adults. Increased overjet, overbite and extraction therapy were not associated with greater root resorption. Duration of treatment and length of treatment time with rectangular wires were associated with greater root resorption. Patients wearing composite brackets with a metal slot had more resorption than patients <b>wearing</b> <b>metal</b> brackets. Conclusion: Pre-treatment risk indicator for root resorption was abnormal root shape. Risk indicators for root resorption that were related to treatment procedures included length of treatment time with rectangular wires, duration of treatment and treatment with composite brackets with a metal slot...|$|E
