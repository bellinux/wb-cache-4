When the early drafts (circa 1955) {{were replaced by}} the more concrete estimates a proposed design, {{one of the first}} drafts <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> weighing 400–500kg and 35cm in diameter.

25|$|The NTSB was {{notified}} about 8:50pm {{the day of}} the accident; a full go-team was assembled in Washington, D.C. and arrived on scene early the next morning.

The Attorney General is empowered to declare an investigation to be linked to a criminal act, and require the NTSB to relinquish control of the investigation to the FBI. In the case of TWA 800, the FBI initiated a parallel criminal investigation alongside the NTSB's accident investigation.|$|E

25|$|The {{roofs of}} the White Tower and its turrets were {{repaired}} in the 1960s and 1970s. Accumulated dirt was washed from the exterior and the floors inside replaced.

The Tower of London is in the care of Historic Royal Palaces, a charity, and between 2008 and 2011 a £2million conservation programme was undertaken at the White Tower. Repairs were carried out and the keep was cleaned, removing pollution that was causing damage to the structure. The White Tower is a GradeI listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. The Royal Armouries still have displays at the White Tower.|$|E
500|$|Richard Charles LaPoint, an Army {{veteran and}} [...] "New England beach bum", boarded Hughes Airwest Flight 800 at McCarran airport in Las Vegas on January 20. Brandishing what he claimed <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> while the DC-9 {{was on the}} taxiway, he demanded $50,000, two parachutes, and a helmet. After {{releasing}} the passengers and two flight attendants, he ordered the plane on an eastward trajectory toward Denver, then bailed out over the treeless plains of northeastern Colorado. Authorities, tracking the locator-equipped parachute and his footprints {{in the snow and}} mud, apprehended him a few hours later.|$|E
500|$|While the Emir vacillated, {{the mission}} found a more {{sympathetic}} and ready {{audience in the}} Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, and the Emir's younger son, Amanullah Khan. Nasrullah Khan had been present at the first meeting at Paghman. In secret meetings with the [...] "Amanullah party" [...] at his residence, he encouraged the mission. Amanullah Khan gave the group reasons to feel confident, even as rumours of these meetings reached the Emir. Messages from von Hentig to Prince Henry, [...] intercepted by British and Russian intelligence, were subsequently passed on to Emir Habibullah. These suggested that to draw Afghanistan into the war, von Hentig was prepared to organise [...] "internal revulsions" [...] in Afghanistan if necessary. Habibullah found these reports concerning, and discouraged expedition members from meeting with his sons except in his presence. All of Afghanistan's immediate preceding rulers save Habibullah's father had died of unnatural causes. The fact that his immediate relatives were pro-German, while he was allied with Britain, gave him justifiable grounds to fear for his safety and his kingdom. Von Hentig described one audience with Habibullah where von Hentig set off his pocket alarm clock. The action, designed to impress Habibullah, instead frightened him; he may have believed it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> about to go off. Despite von Hentig's reassurances and explanations, the meeting was a short one.|$|E

500|$|Born John Bateman, the {{character}} later known as Lucas North {{was raised in}} rural Cumbria, where {{his father was a}} Methodist minister. During his time at Leeds University he lived with Maya Lahan (Laila Rouass). While enrolled at Leeds he visited Dakar, Senegal, where he engaged in shipping cannabis to Hamburg in exchange for money. When he was caught the authorities took the shipment and his money, stranding him in Dakar. To gain enough money {{to get back to the}} UK, he worked in a casino. [...] While working there John Bateman was approached by Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen), who persuaded him to deliver packages for him. One of the packages delivered by Bateman <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> that exploded at a British Embassy, killing 17 people. To escape the country Bateman killed a friend of his named Lucas North. [...] North had just made it past the first battery of tests for admission to MI5. Bateman assumed North's identity and left Maya behind. Bateman/North would later suppress these memories, believing that Vaughn was solely responsible for the bombing and for his friend's death. He would later join MI5 in place of the real Lucas North and become head of Section D. He was also once married to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza). During an operation in Russia, Lucas North was captured and imprisoned for eight years, during which time he was often subjected to torture.|$|E
