5|$|Adams would {{sometimes}} accept challenge matches at his performances. For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty {{of the best}} players in the city. Adams manipulated the balls <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> while his opponents used cues and were given a handicap equivalent to a 1,000 point lead.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Adams {{broke the}} world record run for {{successive}} straight rail points in a match with champion player Jacob Schaefer, Sr., in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, albeit <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> rather than with a cue. Adams stated {{in an interview in}} his later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts.|$|E
25|$|Chikatilo later {{claimed that}} his marital sex life was minimal and that, {{after his wife}} {{understood}} {{he was unable to}} maintain an erection, they agreed she would conceive by him ejaculating externally and pushing his semen inside her vagina <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> In 1965, Feodosia gave birth to a daughter, Lyudmila. Four years later, in 1969, a son named Yuri was born.|$|E

25|$|Kenneth Ray Carllile (April 2, 1931July 31, 1987), {{better known}} as Thumbs Carllile (Carlisle in some collections), was an {{innovative}} American country music guitarist and songwriter known for his zither-style fingerstyle playing, sitting with his guitar in his lap while fretting, picking and strumming <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and thumbs. He performed with Little Jimmy Dickens at the Grand Ole Opry in the early 1950s, {{and was a member}} of Roger Miller's band from 1964 to 1972.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} personage {{from the}} legend of the Nibelungs is Gunnarr. On the Västerljung Runestone, there are three sides and one of them shows a man whose arms and legs are encircled by snakes. He is holding his arms stretched out gripping an object that may be a harp, but that part is damaged due to flaking. The image appears to be depicting an older version of the Gunnarr legend in which he played the harp <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> which appears in the archaic eddic poem Atlakviða.|$|E
25|$|A {{point man}} usually preceded each team - {{crawling}} silently through defenses, probing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> {{to detect and}} neutralize obstacles, while the others followed behind. Sometimes gaps in the wire were created by tying down strands to make an assault corridor. Woven mats might be thrown over barbed wire to facilitate passage. Sappers often used Bangalore torpedoes made from blocks of TNT tied to bamboo poles to blast open assault routes. Attack routes often took unexpected avenues of approach, such as through the trash pits of US Firebase Cunningham in 1969.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most rock guitarists, Buckingham {{does not}} {{play with a}} pick; instead, he picks the strings <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and fingernails. Initially after joining Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham used a Gibson Les Paul. Before the band, a Fender Telecaster was his main guitar, and was used on his first Fleetwood Mac album. In 1979, he worked with Rick Turner, owner of Renaissance Guitars to create the Model One. He has used it {{extensively}} since, both with Fleetwood Mac and for his solo efforts. He uses a Taylor Guitar 814ce {{for most of his}} acoustic performances and has also used an Ovation Celebrity in the past. In the 1980s, he also extensively used the Fairlight CMI.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, he undertook several exhausting tours. His agent Johnny Collins's erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash. Breach of contract violations plagued him. Finally, he hired Joe Glaser as his new manager, a tough mob-connected wheeler-dealer, who began to straighten out his legal mess, his mob troubles, and his debts. Armstrong also began to experience problems <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and lips, which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style. As a result, he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances. He appeared in movies again, including Crosby's 1936 hit Pennies from Heaven. In 1937, Armstrong substituted for Rudy Vallee on the CBS radio network {{and became the first}} African American to host a sponsored, national broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{played only}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> disdaining the cue stick entirely. He {{was known for}} his skill at finger billiards and for the quickness of his play. In {{exhibitions}} it was sometimes advertised that Adams would attempt to make 100 shots in 100 seconds. He would always begin by [...] "feeling out" [...] the cushions on the table, as the speed of the tables varied almost nightly, some fast and some slow.|$|E

500|$|Deacon usually {{played the}} bass <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> {{instead of using}} a plectrum. He counted his {{influences}} as Chic, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. His favourite bass players were Chris Squire of the progressive rock band Yes and The Who's John Entwistle. A trademark of Deacon's playing are his bass runs. A 1975 review of Sheer Heart Attack said [...] "Only at the end would a new initiate to Queen recognise John Deacon's unmistakable trademark... the least well known musician in Queen {{is one of his}} rock generation's most able." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Kelley {{listening}} to [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] on her Walkman as Mars walks in. Mars stops the tape player, removes the cassette tape and begins singing his song. As the instrumental {{portion of the}} song begins, Mars pulls the media out of the cassette tape and arranges the media into letters forming his name followed by the song title. As the song continues, he forms {{a picture of a}} drum, again on the table, using the tape media. Additional images of similar construction follow throughout the video including a portrait of Mars as well as one of Kelley blinking her eyes and smiling as Mars continues singing. Most of the images shown are animated, including a bell which Mars rings <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> in synchronization with the chimes {{near the end of the}} song. Lastly, Mars finishes the song while singing and playing an upright piano while Kelley watches and smiles. The video was inspired by the artwork of Erika Iris Simmons.|$|E
500|$|Whether true or not, the CIA's {{exploding}} cigar assassination plot {{inspired the}} cover of the October 1963 issue (#82) of Mad Magazine. Conceived by Al Jaffee, the cover (pictured at right) bears the headline, [...] "You'll Get a BANG out of this issue of Mad Magazine", and features a painting by Norman Mingo depicting Castro in the act of lighting a cigar wrapped with a cigar band on which is drawn Alfred E. Neuman <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> plugging his ears, awaiting the explosion. An exploding cigar is also featured on the poster for the Channel 4 British Documentary, 638 Ways to Kill Castro, which shows Castro with a cigar in his mouth that has a fuse projecting from the end and a lit match approaching. An exploding cigar was tested on a season 2 episode of Deadliest Warrior, KGB vs. CIA. The cigar completely destroyed the upper and lower jaw of a gel head but was determined to be very unreliable due to its timed fuse and small explosive payload.|$|E

2500|$|If {{one of the}} batsman {{turns to}} {{complete}} runs after the first without grounding his person or equipment behind the popping crease, then a short run is signalled by the umpire tapping his near shoulder <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and the short runs are not scored. If more than one run is short, the umpire will inform the scorers as {{to the number of}} runs scored. See [...]|$|E
2500|$|Paralysed from 1909, {{he had to}} {{live the}} rest of his life in an armchair. This did not prevent him from working on an entire series of landscapes and flowers. He had begun flower {{paintings}} earlier, but from 1908 he concentrated all his creative energy into the subject. Toward the end of his life, Luchian was no longer able to hold the painter's brush <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> and was instead helped to tie it to his wrist in order to continue work.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the second}} time in nine months, the South African test side found itself in a ball-{{tampering}} scandal, this time with medium-pace bowler Vernon Philander found guilty of tampering with the ball during the 3rd day of the Galle test against Sri Lanka in 2014. Philander was found to have breached clause 42.1 of the Laws, [...] "scratching the ball <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and thumb", and was fined 75% of his match fee. South Africa were to go on and win the test by 153 runs.|$|E

2500|$|Van Eyck's superb oil {{painting}} technique is evident throughout. [...] Gold leaf is only {{used for the}} seven rays {{coming in from the}} left; paint is used for all the gold on Gabriel, often worked wet-on-wet to achieve the textural effects of his brocaded clothes. [...] In a shadowy area behind the stool van Eyck worked a glaze <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> [...] The play of light over the many different textures in the painting is brilliantly rendered, and the illusionistic detail, especially in Gabriel's rich costume, is exceptional.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> I kept shaking my head [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and that night I was on my way back to New York with Frank.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{makes use}} of the [...] "pick and fingers" [...] {{technique}} (sometimes referred to as [...] "hybrid picking") where he plays bass notes and rhythm with a pick between his first finger and thumb, and adds melody and punctuation by plucking the treble strings <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> He also {{makes use of}} different guitar tunings, such as (low to high) CGDGBE, DADGBE, DADGAD, and more. [...] This enables him to adapt traditional songs, as on Strict Tempo! and 1000 Years of Popular Music. [...] Thompson occasionally makes use of a thumb-pick, playing in fingerstyle, the most notable example being on the motorcycle ballad [...] "1952 Vincent Black Lightning." ...|$|E
