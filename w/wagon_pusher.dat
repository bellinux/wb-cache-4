50|$|Chalakudy used {{to house}} the tramway {{workshop}} and timber yard. The section had two locomotives to pull the trucks and saloons. The locomotives, rolling stock and machinery for the tramway were supplied by Orenstein and Koppel of Germany. P&W MacLennan of the U.K. supplied the bridges and culverts. K.R. Menon was the last tramway engineer. The tramway system had double lines and worked on rollers and cables. Empty wagons were rolled up while loaded <b>wagons</b> were <b>pushed</b> down along the other rails.|$|R
60|$|After much {{deliberation}} {{with the}} knights {{with him and}} {{the captain of the}} mercenaries, it was agreed in the first instance to attempt to attack the place by filling up a portion of the moat and ascending by scaling ladders. Huge screens of wood were made, and these were placed on wagons; the wagons themselves were filled with bags of earth, and a large number of men getting beneath them shoved the ponderous machines forward {{to the edge of the}} moat. The bags of stones and earth were then thrown in, and the <b>wagons</b> <b>pushed</b> backward to obtain a fresh supply. This operation was of course an exceedingly slow one, a whole day being occupied with each trip of the wagons. They were not unmolested in their advance, for, from the walls, mangonels and other machines hurled great stones down upon the wooden screens, succeeding sometimes, in spite of their thickness, in crashing through them, killing many of the men beneath. The experiment was also tried of throwing balls of Greek fire down upon the wood; but as this was green and freshly felled it would not take fire, but the flames dropping through, with much boiling pitch and other materials, did grievously burn and scald the soldiers working below it. Upon both sides every device was tried. The crossbowmen among the mercenaries kept up a fire upon the walls to hinder the defenders from interfering with the operations, while the archers above shot steadily, and killed many of those who ventured within range of their bows.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, <b>pushing</b> <b>wagon</b> loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|R
50|$|The layout was all {{the more}} {{striking}} because it was multi-level, with narrow gauge lines at ground level, at an intermediate level for transferring slates by hand horizontally from narrow gauge wagon to standard gauge wagon and at higher level for <b>pushing</b> <b>wagons</b> off and onto hosts. Conversely, there was a standard gauge siding at a higher level to enable coal and other goods to have gravity on their side as they were transferred to narrow gauge tubs or road vehicles for distribution.|$|R

50|$|The Legacy was {{introduced}} in the USA as a competitor to the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Stanza, and Mazda 626, with the Legacy offering All Wheel Drive (AWD) as a major distinguishing feature against its competition. (Toyota initially offered AWD on the Camry in the USA in limited markets, with the designation Camry LE All-Trac, but discontinued the feature due to disappointing sales.) The only Japanese competitor to continue offering all-wheel-drive in a similarly sized sedan was Mitsubishi in the premium sport package Mitsubishi Galant VR-4, whereas Subaru offered all-wheel-drive as an option on all trim levels internationally. The Legacy sedan had very similar dimensions and appearance to the current at the time Toyota Cressida. When Subaru decided to offer a sedan and <b>wagon</b> that <b>pushed</b> the limits of Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine size, it appears they drew inspiration from early 1970s Toyota Mark II and Nissan Maxima, adding their all-wheel drive to the list of options as a safety feature.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{death on}} the line {{occurred}} on 9 October 1891 when an 85-year-old man, Mr William Russell, who was partially deaf, was hit at the Larkhill crossing by the 5.20 from Kemble [...] "literally cutting him to pieces, scattering his members about the line in horrible dissection". Later that year a man was crushed to death by a 4-ton stone boulder while trimming back the rock cutting in Tetbury station yard. In June 1900 Miss Olive Mitchell, the proprietress of a Tetbury grocer’s shop, while returning from a stay in Gloucester Lunatic Asylum, threw herself {{in front of a}} goods train at Kemble. Soon after World War II when there were still enough servicemen in the area to warrant the use of a NAAFI wagon to deliver supplies to Tetbury one such <b>wagon</b> was <b>pushed</b> through the Goods Shed doors by its unattended engine. Until replaced by a sliding corrugated-iron door some time later, repairs were temporarily effected with a tarpaulin sheet.|$|R
50|$|Horses {{were used}} for many years for {{shunting}} duties in the station yard during stock season. It was noted {{that at this time}} of year they were used up to four times a week. In 1922 it was requested that the cattle-stop on the stockyard siding - which crossed a public road at the north end of the yard - be planked between the rails to enable the use of horses to place wagons at the loading bank. Prior to this request, consigners <b>pushed</b> <b>wagons</b> by hand across the road to a point where they could be worked by horses.|$|R
50|$|In 1888 Mt Tolmer {{became the}} site of the first tin mine and {{produced}} a continual supply of tin. Bamboo Creek's tin mining operation began at Makanbarr, A Mak Mak Marranunggu campsite, in 1906. High-quality tin was often found in the ancient riverbeds and {{on the surface of the}} hills. All it needed was to be bagged and sold. Small groups operated this way for the next 30 years. By 1941 miners began following the tin-bearing seams into the hills using picks and shovels, and loading the ore into <b>wagons</b> to be <b>pushed</b> or pulled back to the mines' entrances.|$|R
50|$|The {{camp was}} split into {{three or four}} sections. The {{administration}} and garrison area included the main gate entrance for the road-bound traffic and living quarters for the staff. The second section included the railway platform, where the victims were taken off the Holocaust trains, as well as barracks where the Sonderkommando Jews performed camp labour. In the third section were the brick gas chamber with metal roofing and a small narrow-gauge rail with hand <b>pushed</b> <b>wagons</b> (the type used at saw mills), for trundling the gassed bodies out of it, {{as well as several}} mass graves.|$|R
5|$|The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in {{an attempt}} to {{expedite}} its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh. Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake. Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers. Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the <b>wagons.</b> He <b>pushed</b> on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors. The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed {{the fact that they had}} just crossed. Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall.|$|R

The station was provided with two platforms: a signal box was built on the up platform and the main station buildings were on the down platform. The signal box was situated near the level crossing over a minor road linking Little Steeping with Great Steeping to the north.

60|$|The nearest drift to Cronje {{was only}} {{a mile or two}} distant, Klipkraal the name; next to that the Paardeberg Drift; next to that the Wolveskraal Drift, each about seven miles from the other. Had Cronje pushed on {{instantly}} after the action, he might have got across at Klipkraal. But men, horses, and bullocks were equally exhausted after a long twenty-four hours' marching and fighting. He gave his weary soldiers some hours' rest, and then, abandoning seventy-eight of his <b>wagons,</b> he <b>pushed</b> on before daylight for the farthest off of the three fords (Wolveskraal Drift). Could he reach and cross it before his enemies, he was safe. The Klipkraal Drift had in the meanwhile been secured by the Buffs, the West Ridings, and the Oxfordshire Light Infantry after a spirited little action which, in the rapid rush of events, attracted less attention than it deserved. The brunt of the fighting fell upon the Oxfords, who lost ten killed and thirty-nine wounded. It was not a waste of life, however, for the action, though small and hardly recorded, was really a very essential one in the campaign.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scene at}} ground level was {{dominated}} by the exchange sidings of standard and narrow gauges, with waist high narrow gauge tracks for manual transfer of slates leading to high level transfer sidings nearest the passenger platform.

The GWR, the LNWR (and the Padarn Railway) built fleets of transporter wagons with narrow gauge tracks set on top. Loaded narrow-gauge wagons were rolled onto the tracks on the larger wagons, locked into place then carried pick-a-back to a narrow-gauge railhead in the GWR's case, to [...] by the Padarn and by the LNWR to - which the company expensively and unprofitably expanded for slate traffic. The GWR and Padarn tracks were set longitudinally on the host wagons, so narrow gauge wagons were end-loaded.

50|$|One factor {{which may}} have {{maintained}} the population (as is referred to above) was the extensive iron ore quarrying {{which took place in}} the western and southern parts of the parish. Quarrying began west of the road to Harby {{at the top of the}} scarp face.The ore was taken down the scarp face by narrow gauge tramway on a rope worked incline to sidings on the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway near Harby where it was loaded into railway wagons for transport to the iron works at Staveley,Derbyshire. As the quarries got further away from the incline the tramway was gradually extended.and from 1884 the tramway between the quarries and the incline top was worked by steam locomotives..Before that the <b>wagons</b> were <b>pushed</b> by hand or pulled by horses, the distance then being short..By 1913 the active quarries were either side of the Waltham Road close to the White Lodge.The tramway was then extended eastwards to sere new quarries at Eaton and Branston.

By 1959 the active quarry at Eastwell was on the south east side of the Scalford Road, beyond the cross roads.The tramway was used only occasionally from then on and was taken up in 1961 and 1962.From 1959 the ore was taken by lorry to the railway sidings near Harby. The last quarry to be worked at Eastwell was on the east side of the Waltham Road,south of the White Lodge. This closed in 1967.|$|R

60|$|Hurry, was the word! We {{wasted no}} time. Our party {{consisted}} of four persons--a blacksmith sixty years of age, two young lawyers, and myself. We bought a wagon and two miserable old horses. We put eighteen {{hundred pounds of}} provisions and mining tools in the wagon and drove out of Carson on a chilly December afternoon. The horses were so weak and old that we soon found {{that it would be}} better if one or two of us got out and walked. It was an improvement. Next, we found {{that it would be better}} if a third man got out. That was an improvement also. It was at this time that I volunteered to drive, although I had never driven a harnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt fairly excused from such a responsibility. But in a little while it was found that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked also. It was at this time that I resigned the position of driver, and never resumed it again. Within the hour, we found that it would not only be better, but was absolutely necessary, that we four, taking turns, two at a time, should put our hands against the end of the <b>wagon</b> and <b>push</b> it through the sand, leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of the way and hold up the tongue. Perhaps it is well for one to know his fate at first, and get reconciled to it. We had learned ours in one afternoon. It was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove that wagon and those horses two hundred miles. So we accepted the situation, and from that time forth we never rode. More than that, we stood regular and nearly constant watches pushing up behind.|$|R

25|$|The most {{successful}} freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson's Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. Tipper wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line {{and then up}} the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the <b>wagons</b> were originally <b>pushed</b> by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp. After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding (in what is now New Romney station car park), the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.|$|R

The ninth wagon was derailed by the LMS mail locomotive, skidding into the down cutting by the bridge just ahead of the locomotive. The tenth wagon was hurled by the engine off the rails and collided with the down cutting of the bridge, coming to a halt close to the GWR Engine. The eleventh wagon followed the tenth, clipping the mail train's tender which stopped it.

5000|$|St Austell {{railway station}} was opened by the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859 on the {{hillside}} above the town centre. Two branch lines west of the town were later opened to serve the china clay industry; the Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway which is still partly open, and the short-lived Trenance Valley line. The independent narrow gauge Pentewan Railway ran from West Hill to the coast at Pentewan. The Cornish Main Line in St Austell is quite renowned for its viaduct which passes through the Gover Valley and Trenance areas of the town. the original timber structure was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it was 115 ft high, 720 ft long on 10 piers; it {{was replaced by a}} new stone viaduct in 1899. There was a siding located west of the viaduct. In the early years trains from St Austell had to <b>push</b> <b>wagons</b> over the tall, curving viaduct to shunt this siding. The Great Western Railway's instructions stated that: [...] "Trucks may be pushed from St Austell to the Siding, but when this is done the speed of the Train between the two places must not exceed 8 miles an hour, and the head Guard must ride on the leading vehicle, unless it be a bonnet end one, in which case he must ride in the first low sided vehicle from it, to keep a good look out, and be prepared to give a signal to the Driver either by Day or Night, as may be required".

50|$|In January 1863, Grant {{established}} an impressive logistics system running from his depots at Cairo, Illinois, and Memphis to advance bases established along the levees at Lake Providence, Milliken's Bend, and Young's Point-the latter being just ten river miles from Vicksburg. Supplies {{as well as}} troops moved down river on a sizeable fleet of army-contracted riverboats. These transports varied considerably in size, but many were capable of carrying 300,000 pounds of supplies-the equivalent of 150 wagonloods. At the end of March, when Grant decided to move his army south of Vicksburg on the Louisiana side of the river, he hoped to have water transport {{most or all of}} the way. Union engineers, augmented by details from McClernand's and Sherman's corps, dug a canal at Duckport linking the Mississippi to the network of bayous paralleling the army's route of march. The canal was completed successfully, but falling water levels made it useless before it could do any good. As a last resort, Union logisticians <b>pushed</b> <b>wagon</b> trains along the sixty-three-mile route that McClernand's and McPherson's corps traveled, from Milliken's Bend to Bruinsburg. Some supplies were hauled by wagon from Milliken's Bend to Perkins' Plantation, just below New Carthage. There, they were loaded on riverboats that had run by the Vicksburg batteries, for delivery to the army downstream. About 11 May, over a week after the bulk of the army had crossed to the east bank, Sherman's men completed a new road from Young's Point to Bowers' Landing, across the base of De Soto point. This road shortened the wagon haul to twelve miles-still a two-day haul over the rough roads. From Bower's Landing, steamers carried supplies down the river to the newly won logistical base at Grand Gulf.|$|R
5000|$|The word ‘Hijab' is {{relatively}} new for me. It was {{not a part of}} my vocabulary as I was growing up. I learned it much later, when I began to read literary and religious Urdu texts. ... The relevant word that I learned growing up was purdah. And I learned the word and its many meanings in the observed practice of the various female members of my middle-class family in Bara Banki, a small town in north India.For Ammi, my grandmother, purdah meant almost never venturing out of the house. On the rare occasions when she did, it was always an elaborate ritual. Visiting a family in the neighbourhood -- only on the occasion of some tragedy, ... she used a doli. The little stool slung from a pole that two men carried would be brought to our back door -- the door to the zanana or the ladies' section -- and the two carriers would step away behind the curtain wall. Ammi would wrap herself in a white sheet and squat on the flat stool, and a heavy custom-made cover would be thrown over her and the doli. The two bearers would then come back and carry the doli away on their shoulders. ... When Ammi traveled in my father's car, she covered herself the same way, while {{the back seat of the}} car where she sat was made completely invisible by pieces of cloth hung across the windows.Apa, my mother, belonged to the next generation. She used a burqa. Hers was a two piece ‘modern' outfit, as opposed to the one-piece -- derisively called ‘the shuttlecock' by my sisters -- that was preferred by the older or more conservatively spirited in the family. I also remember that the older generation's burqas were usually white, while the new burqas were always black.Apa’s burqa’ consisted of a skirt and a separate top throw -- one that covered her from the head to the thighs. The two pieces allowed for easier movement of both arms and legs. The top had a separate veil hanging over the face, which Apa could throw back in the company of women, e.g. while traveling in the ladies compartment on a train, or hold partly aside to look at things more closely when she went shopping. Apa wore a burqa all her life, except of course when she went to Mecca for Hajj. There she wore the same sheets of ihram that Ammi had to were earlier. Like all women pilgrims then and now, she too exposed her face to everyone’s sight but not her hair.... I should not neglect to mention that in those days -- I’m talking about the Forties -- it was considered improper even for Hindu ladies of certain classes to be seen in public with their hair and faces uncovered, particularly the married women. They never wore a burqa -- that was for Muslims alone. Instead, they used a shawl, a plain white sheet, or the palloo of their saris to cover what was not for strangers to see. They too lived in houses that had separate women’s quarters. Their daughters traveled to school daily in a covered <b>wagon</b> that was <b>pushed</b> by two men, just like their Muslim counterparts.
