40|$|ABSTRACT Quail, chickens, and turkeys vaccinated with pigeon and fowl <b>pox</b> <b>viruses</b> {{were not}} {{protected}} against challenge of their immunity with quail <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> and they developed severe cutaneous lesions of pox. When quail and chickens were vaccinated with quail <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> and given pigeon and fowl <b>pox</b> challenge <b>viruses,</b> no protection was present. Thus, quail <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> had no immunologic relationship to pigeon and fowl <b>pox</b> <b>viruses.</b> Psittacine <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> applied as a vaccine in quail and chickens {{also failed to}} protect against quail <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> challenge. However, quail, chickens, and turkeys vaccinated with quail <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> were protected against quail <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> challenge. An isolate of psittacine <b>pox</b> <b>virus,</b> applied as a vaccine, protected chickens against challenge with the same virus isolate and also against challenge with two other psittacine <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> isolates, confirming a close or identical antigenic relationship with each other. When combined in a multivalent vaccine, quail, psittacine, and fowl <b>pox</b> <b>viruses</b> induced excellent protection in chickens against challenge with the three respective viruses. The {{presence or absence of}} "takes " or reactions following vaccination by the wing web route did not necessarily correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} immunity noted from challenge by feather follicle virus application. The role of quail and psittacine <b>pox</b> <b>viruses</b> as potential pathogens for poultry was discussed briefly. (Key words: <b>pox</b> <b>virus,</b> pathogenicity, vaccines, immunity...|$|R

50|$|Avian <b>pox</b> <b>viruses</b> {{appear to}} be family or order specific, that is, a <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> infecting gamebirds {{is not likely to}} infect songbirds and vice versa. There is no known {{evidence}} of any avian <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> strain transmissible to humans.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the antigenic differences among fowl, pigeon, and canary <b>pox</b> <b>viruses.</b> Also to, determine the cross protection potentials of these viruses and to select one of these viruses' isolates as live vaccine candidates against fowl pox. There was no death following challenge of experimental birds by canary <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> (CPV). Where as, there was death of some birds followed challenge of experimental birds by fowl (FPV) <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> and pigeon <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> (PPV). This result showed that canary <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> isthe safest of the three viruses for vaccination as a live vaccine. Fowl, pigeon and canary pox antigens were prepared by inoculating 0. 1 ml of 10 - 3 diluted isolates via chorioallantoic membrane of 11 - 12 day old embryonated chickenâ€™s eggs. Inoculation of the CAM by the three viruses showed clear distinguishable pock lesions for each virus. Sera were obtained from experimental chickens. Examination of fowl, pigeon and canary pox antisera against fowl pox, pigeon pox and canary pox antigens respectively by AGPT test showed clear precipitin lines. Examination of fowl, pigeon and canary pox antisera against fowl pox, pigeon pox and canary pox antigens respectively by Passive haemagglutination (PHA) gave positive results. These result indicated that there is serological and antigenic relationship between the three viruses. V Titration of 0. 1 ml of each isolate of the 3 -viruses in embryonated chicken eggs showed that the EID 50 of fowl and pigeonspox viruses' were 10 9. 3 and that of canary <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> was 10 10. 5. When pigeons were infected by fowl and canary <b>pox</b> <b>viruses</b> no lesions appeared. Also when canaries were infected by fowl and pigeon <b>pox</b> <b>viruses</b> no lesions appeared. But when Chicken were infected by canary, pigeon and fowl <b>pox</b> <b>viruses</b> lesions appeared. Thatmeans chickens are susceptible to both canary and pigeon viruses, so there is pathogenic relationship between chicken, pigeon and canary <b>pox</b> <b>viruses,</b> where as pigeons are resistant to fowl and canary <b>pox</b> <b>viruses,</b> which means thatthere is no pathogenic relationship between pigeons and canary and fowl pox viruses; also canary birds are resistant to fowl and pigeon <b>pox</b> <b>viruses,</b> which means there is no pathogenic relationship between pigeon and fowl <b>pox</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} serum {{neutralizing}} tests with the <b>viruses</b> of <b>pox,</b> vaccinia, and <b>virus</b> III disease herewith reported generally agree and supplement {{the results of}} reinoculation experiments on immune rabbits reported in the previous paper (1). The finding that <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> is neutralized by pox immune serum indicates that the refractory state of recovered pox rabbits to reinoculation with <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> {{and the failure of}} recovered pox rabbits to contract a second pox infection after adequate exposure is to be explained upon the basis of the development of an active immunity. The failure of virus III immune serum to neutralize <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> is in agreement with the previous conclusion drawn from the positive results of reinoculation and exposure experiments that there is no specific relationship between <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> and virus III. Rabbits which had recovered from a pox infection were completely refractory to inoculation with dermo-(culture) vaccine, while rabbits which had recovered from vaccinia were partially refractory to inoculation with <b>pox</b> <b>virus.</b> Vaccine immune adult rabbits did not show any clinical evidence of pox upon exposure to florid cases, but young recently weaned vaccine immunes developed definite although comparatively mild pox infections. The serum neutralization tests showed that pox immune serum neutralized vaccine virus although the action was not complete as shown by the positive results obtained with high dilutions of serum; vaccine immune serum possessed some but comparatively slight neutralizing properties against <b>pox</b> <b>virus.</b> The results of the crossed inoculation and serum neutralizing experiments with <b>pox</b> and neurovaccine <b>viruses</b> resembled those obtained with pox and dermo-(culture) vaccine but the differences were less pronounced. The differences in virus neutralizing ability {{on the part of the}} three immune sera paralleled the differences in virus potency as indicated by the character of the local lesions at the site of injection and by the general character of the clinical manifestations of the infection. The potency or virulence of <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> was much greater than that of neurovaccine and vastly greater than that of dermo-(culture) vaccine. The complete identity of <b>pox</b> and vaccine <b>virus</b> could not be established, but a definite relationship between them was demonstrated and this was shown to have an immunological basis. From a practical standpoint vaccination with vaccine virus as a prophylactic measure against rabbit pox was clearly indicated...|$|R

40|$|Experiments are {{reported}} {{in which it was}} shown that rabbits which had recovered from experimental or spontaneous rabbit pox were refractory to inoculation of <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> injected by various routes, and in addition did not develop clinical manifestations of the disease under conditions of exposure to florid cases of pox. It was found that pox recovered rabbits were susceptible to inoculation with the virus of virus III disease of rabbits and that virus III recovered rabbits could be successfully inoculated with <b>pox</b> <b>virus.</b> Furthermore, virus III recovered rabbits developed pox when subjected to room exposure {{in the same manner as}} did normal rabbits. It thus appears that there is no specific relationship between the two viruses. Rabbits which had recovered from experimental or spontaneous pox were found to be just as susceptible to inoculation with the virus of infectious myxoma of rabbits as were normal rabbits, a result which demonstrates that there is no specific relationship between these viruses. Rabbits which had recovered from experimental or spontaneous pox were refractory to inoculation with culture dermovaccine virus, but vaccine recovered rabbits were not completely refractory to inoculation with <b>pox</b> <b>virus.</b> Under conditions of exposure to clinical cases of pox, adult vaccine immune rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations of pox, but young, recently weaned vaccinated rabbits did contract mild but definite clinical pox. Experimental pox recovered rabbits were partially refractory to inoculation with neurovaccine virus and neurovaccine recovered rabbits were partially refractory to inoculation with <b>pox</b> <b>virus.</b> The refractory condition of the pox immune rabbits appeared to be more pronounced than that of the neurovaccine immunes. The cutaneous lesions which developed from the intradermal injection of pox, neurovaccine, and culture vaccine viruses showed definite differences with respect to the rate and persistence of active growth, amount of edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis, and the degree of tissue destructiveness. These features were most pronounced in the lesions of <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> and were least marked in the lesions of culture vaccine virus. The differences were particularly apparent in normal rabbits, but they were also present in the lesions which developed in immune animals. It was found that the calf was susceptible to inoculation with <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> applied to a scarified skin area. There were many similarities in the appearance and course of the pox lesions to those resulting from culture vaccine virus, the New York Board of Health vaccine, and neurovaccine virus similarly inoculated. But the pox lesions were most numerous, much the largest and most destructive, and by far the most persistent while next in order were those of the Board of Health dermovaccine. The results of these various experiments showed that a close relationship obtains between <b>pox</b> <b>virus,</b> on the one hand, and vaccine virus and neurovaccine virus, on the other, but it cannot be said that <b>pox</b> <b>virus</b> is identical in all respects with either one of these viruses. The findings indicated that the relationship between <b>pox</b> and neurovaccine <b>viruses</b> is closer than that between pox and culture vaccine viruses.
