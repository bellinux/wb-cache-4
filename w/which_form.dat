5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems <b>which</b> <b>form</b> during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows <b>which</b> <b>form</b> mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{subdivided}} into three subclasses: Octocorallia, Hexacorallia and Ceriantharia, <b>which</b> <b>form</b> monophyletic groups and generally show differentiating reflections on symmetry of polyp structure for each subclass. The relationships within the subclasses are unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Hedgerows of {{hawthorn}} and blackthorn, <b>which</b> <b>form</b> {{the boundaries}} between the fields, are the principal habitat in these cultivated areas.

5|$|The {{coordination}} chemistry of neptunium(V) {{has been extensively}} researched due {{to the presence of}} cation–cation interactions in the solid state, which had been already known for actinyl ions.

5|$|The four {{terrestrial}} or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, {{few or no}} moons, and no ring systems. They {{are composed}} largely of refractory minerals, such as the silicates, <b>which</b> <b>form</b> their crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, <b>which</b> <b>form</b> their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet {{should not be confused}} with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).|$|E

5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, <b>which</b> <b>form</b> weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E

6000|$|This {{again was}} an {{exceedingly}} remarkable discovery.
