5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's economy {{was one of}} the fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the world economy <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by the financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> especially hard because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{captured}} the Malayan Peninsula, both ships moved to Singapore harbour. On 8 February, the Japanese launched an amphibious assault across the Strait of Johore and following heavy fighting, many ships began evacuating from the harbour. By 11 February Gnat and Grasshopper were the largest vessels left. The two ships left Singapore for Batavia at 21:00 on 13 February, having taken on other personnel to evacuate them. Amongst these was Commander Ian Forbes, {{formerly of the}} battleship , which had been sunk by the Japanese just over two months earlier. By the following morning {{they could hear the}} attacks by Japanese aircraft on other vessels in the distance. As they were sailing south, they were attacked by Japanese bombers. During the initial pass, Grasshopper <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by a single bomb. When the planes returned, Dragonfly <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> three times and sank quickly. Grasshopper <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> twice and was set on fire. The order to abandon ship was given as the fire spread to compartments adjacent to an ammunition store.|$|E

Between them, the three ships lost two men killed and seven wounded and none of them {{suffered}} any significant damage. Tsar Nicholas II relieved Stark and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov who assumed command on 7 March. On 31 March, Petropavlovsk and Poltava sortied to support Russian cruisers and destroyers engaging their Japanese counterparts, but they headed back to Port Arthur to join the rest of the Pacific Squadron when the main Japanese battlefleet appeared. They ran into a newly laid minefield en route and Petropavlovsk struck at least one of the mines. Observers saw three explosions, one of which appeared to be that of her magazines, and the ship sank in less than two minutes. Casualties included Admiral Makarov and his guest, Russian battle artist Vasily Vereshchagin, 26 officers and 652 enlisted men. Only seven officers and 73 crewmen were rescued.|$|E
50|$|A smash {{in tennis}} is a shot that <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> above the hitter's {{head with a}} serve-like motion. It is also {{referred}} to as an overhead. A smash can usually <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> with a high amount of force and is often a shot that ends the point. Most smashes <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> fairly near the net or in mid-court before the ball bounces, generally against lobs that have not <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> high enough or deep enough by the opponent. A player can also smash a very high ball from the baseline, generally on the bounce, although this is often a less forceful smash.|$|R

5|$|During {{the night}} of 15 December, {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet {{encountered}} British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool, while Von der Tann and Derfflinger went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. During the bombardment of Hartlepool, Seydlitz <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> three times and Blücher <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> six times by the coastal battery. Seydlitz suffered only minimal damage, and no casualties. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E
