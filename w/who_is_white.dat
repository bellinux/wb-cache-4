5|$|Irma Johnson is {{the sister}} of the late Warren Johnson and Eve Russell's aunt. When she was young, Eve had a close {{relationship}} with her aunt because of their love of gospel music. Irma is proud of Eve's singing in the church's choir; she discouraged Eve from singing jazz and blues music, calling them sinful. Their relationship became strained when Irma saw a drugged and intoxicated Eve singing in a seedy Boston jazz club and cavorting with several men. Irma disowns Eve when she discovers her relationship with Julian, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>white,</b> and her pregnancy with his child. Eve and Irma did not speak for nearly 20 years. Eve paid for Irma to live in a retirement home, but told everyone she had no living relatives in an attempt to keep her past secret.|$|E
5|$|Tony {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in EastEnders in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year {{absence from the}} show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, Liam Butcher (James Forde) and Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, mixed-race Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>white,</b> had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.|$|E
5|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics, {{many of whom}} were disappointed {{in the absence of an}} explanation for Lisa's obsession with Derek. Others noted that the potential theme of interracial conflict between the Charles family, who are black, and Lisa, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>white,</b> was unexplored. The storyline of Obsessed has been compared with that of Fatal Attraction (1987) - a recollection in which Elba and Beyoncé have the Michael Douglas and Anne Archer roles, respectively, while Larter is in Glenn Close's - although film critics disliked the fact that Derek did not yield to Lisa's seduction. The fight scene finale between Sharon and Lisa, however, was commended by reviewers, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. Obsessed spent its first week atop the US box office, and grossed $73.8million from theaters, internationally. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for home viewing on August4,2009, in the US and has sold 1.3million DVDs, worth $21million of consumer spending.|$|E

25|$|Today, cricket is {{the second}} most popular sport in South Africa, and is the only sport in the country to feature in the top 2 sports of all race groups. This has had both successes – Herschelle Gibbs, a Cape Coloured, is one of the sport's most {{dominating}} batsmen and the black bowler Makhaya Ntini reached number 2 in the ICC Player Rankings in 2006 – and unintended side effects. Kevin Pietersen, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>white</b> and was born to a South African father and English mother, left the country claiming that he was put at a disadvantage by the quota system, and within a few years became one of the world's top batsmen – {{as a member of the}} England cricket team.|$|E
