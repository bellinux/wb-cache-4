5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
