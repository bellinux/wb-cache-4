5|$|Saguaro National Park {{lies within}} the {{watershed}} of the north-flowing Santa Cruz River, {{which is generally}} dry. Rincon Creek {{in the southern part}} of the RMD, free-flowing for at least part of the year, has the largest riparian zone in the park. The creek is a tributary of Pantano Wash, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two <b>washes</b> form the Rillito River, another dry wash, an east–west tributary of the Santa Cruz River. The <b>washes</b> in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods. Smaller riparian zones are found near springs and tinajas in the RMD. The largest of the springs is at Manning Camp, high in the Rincons.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effect of contingent food deliveries on grooming movements in rats. The grooming sequence was divided into three topographically distinct behaviors: paw <b>washing,</b> face <b>washing,</b> and body <b>washing.</b> The first experiment found that rates of paw <b>washing</b> and body <b>washing</b> increased reliably under a food contingency, but face <b>washing</b> did not. A second experiment replicated these findings, and, in addition, showed that the average duration of paw <b>washing</b> and body <b>washing</b> decreased in length when followed by food. Placing a contingency on face <b>washing,</b> however, produced {{an increase in the}} rate of paw <b>washing</b> but no increase in face <b>washing.</b> It was concluded that, on the one hand, paw <b>washing</b> and body <b>washing</b> may be influenced by operant contingencies {{in the same way as}} behaviors such as lever pressing. On the other hand, increases in paw <b>washing</b> under the face <b>washing</b> contingency suggested that increases in the rate of grooming movements may occur by means other than operant relations...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define the optimal boxthorn berries <b>washing</b> method for {{developing}} the boxthorn berries cleaner.

50|$|The <b>wash</b> phase {{begins when}} the <b>wash</b> bowl is {{appropriately}} filled with red cells.

50|$|The Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> is {{especially}} favorable {{when combined with}} the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit. The combination and advantageous interconnections between a Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit and a Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> lead to smaller equipment and better operability. The gas coming from the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit {{can be sent to}} the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> at low temperature (directly from the methanol absorber without being warmed up). Since part of the purified gas is reheated in the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit, small fluctuations in flow and temperatures can easily be compensated leading to best operability. To improve the hydrogen recovery, an integrated hydrogen recycle from the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> to the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit can be installed, which uses the already existing recycle compressor of the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit to recycle the hydrogen-rich flash gas from the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> back into the feed gas of the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit. This leads to extremely high hydrogen recovery rates without any further equipment.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to compare the efficiency of counter-current and co-current filter cake <b>washing</b> techniques. Filter cake <b>washing</b> is a common unit operation which {{is used in the}} chemical process industry for improving the recovery of the liquid phase or for purifying the solid phase of the filter cake. Counter-current displacement <b>washing</b> is more difficult to arrange and it requires additional process equipment but the advantage of counter-current method is that the consumption of <b>wash</b> water that is required for achieving certain filter cake purity may be considerably decreased when compared to the co-current <b>washing</b> method. This is true especially for materials that are difficult to <b>wash.</b> The literature part of this thesis consists of a review of filter cake <b>washing</b> in general, including the basic principles of co-current and counter-current techniques, and a description of the structure and operation of a horizontal vacuum belt filter, which is the equipment considered in the experimental part of this thesis. Also the most common cake <b>washing</b> models are introduced. The experiments were performed by <b>washing</b> wheat apatite filter cakes in a laboratory scale vacuum filter by using both co-current and counter-current <b>washing</b> methods. The main results of these tests were the <b>washing</b> curves that relate the purity of the filter cake to the amount of <b>wash</b> liquid used. Comparison between the obtained <b>washing</b> curves showed that both <b>washing</b> methods could be efficiently applied for achieving good <b>washing</b> results. The differences between the <b>wash</b> liquid consumptions in the co-current and counter-current <b>washing</b> methods were found to be surprisingly small but this is most probably explained by the relatively good <b>washing</b> characteristics of the apatite cakes. The <b>washing</b> models introduced in the literature part were compared with the results obtained from the experiments and it was found out that the studied cake <b>washing</b> processes could be describe...|$|R

5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local <b>washes</b> were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E
5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, <b>washes</b> eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of <b>washing</b> cycles on the functional properties of <b>washed</b> duck meat.

Double <b>washing</b> showed significantly higher Lightness (L*) and Whiteness (W) values than the other <b>washing</b> cycles. <b>Washing</b> cycles increased the shear force of the samples (p> 0. 05). <b>Washing</b> cycles also significantly affected pH, folding test, gel strength, expressible moisture and WHC; quadruple <b>washing</b> exhibited a significantly higher pH, folding score, expressible moisture and WHC but reduced the gel strength of the sample.
