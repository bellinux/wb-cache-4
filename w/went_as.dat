5|$|After seducing Drusus' wife Livilla, Sejanus {{convinced}} {{her that he}} loved her and <b>went</b> <b>as</b> far as to divorce his own wife, Apicata. They involved Livilla's physician, Eudemus, whom they met in secret for some time. With the help of Livilla, Drusus was poisoned and died of what passed as natural causes on 14 September 23. Cassius Dio says the actions of Sejanus were revealed in a letter by Apicata following his death in October 31.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band <b>went</b> <b>as</b> far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|Formed in late 1853, the Conciliation cabinet {{faced the}} Parliament {{only when it}} {{gathered}} in May 1854. Paraná presented a bill to reform the Code of Criminal Procedure, which had already been reformed in 1841. In search of support, Paraná <b>went</b> <b>as</b> far as to aid Liberal candidates in the 1854 provincial elections. The opposition by most saquaremas to this judicial reform was so fierce that a year later, Paraná (who had been raised from Viscount to Marquis in late 1854) backed down and implicitly withdrew the bill.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{advanced}} {{along the}} Araxes River, destroying Persian-held Dvin, {{the capital of}} Armenia, and Nakhchivan. At Ganzaka, Heraclius met Khosrow's army, some 40,000 strong. Using loyal Arabs, he captured and killed some of Khosrow's guards, leading to {{the disintegration of the}} Persian army. Heraclius then destroyed the famous fire temple of Takht-i-Suleiman, an important Zoroastrian shrine. Heraclius' raids <b>went</b> <b>as</b> far as the Gayshawan, a residence of Khosrow in Adurbadagan.|$|E

5|$|In September 1883 he <b>went</b> <b>as</b> a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928 Britten <b>went</b> <b>as</b> a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though {{he was not the}} target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she <b>went,</b> <b>as</b> she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E

5|$|Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before, but he {{felt that}} he would find great {{locations}} there. Salooni in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh. In spite of this geographical inexperience, all <b>went</b> <b>as</b> per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan. However, minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, she felt the scorching summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance. In Himachal, it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior shots to outside.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the film}} began shortly after the {{television}} series finishing its original broadcasting on Japanese channels, although pre-production started during the show's run in March 2004. The film's production was led by director Seiji Mizushima, who also had directed the series as well. Mizushima allowed a camera crew and interviewers into the show's conference room at the Bones studios where he described how production <b>went,</b> <b>as</b> seen in a special feature on the DVD release {{of the film}}. The conference room was filled with every cut and drawing created for the show and movie, but it was eventually cleared out {{to make room for}} other projects.|$|E

The aircraft flew in a loose formation and the journey to northern Norway <b>went</b> <b>as</b> planned, though six Lancasters were forced to abort and return to Yagodnik. Despite passing near several German bases, the British force was undetected and no German fighters were airborne over Kaafjord {{at the time of the}} attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{land that}} the Glidden House stands on is {{what remains of}} Joseph Glidden's once large DeKalb County farm. His {{holdings}} stretched along Lincoln Highway, both {{the north and south}} sides, from the Kishwaukee River in the east to present-day Annie Glidden Road on the west. The Glidden Farm <b>went</b> <b>as</b> far north as today's Lucinda Avenue. The farm's south border, near where Glidden would grant the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad right-of-way through DeKalb in the early 1990s was near present-day Taylor Street.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is built}} on the disused {{southern}} viaduct section of a New York Central Railroad line called the West Side Line. Originating in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, the park runs from Gansevoort Street – three blocks below 14th Street – in the Meatpacking District, through Chelsea, to {{the northern edge of}} the West Side Yard on 34th Street near the Javits Center. Formerly, the West Side Line <b>went</b> <b>as</b> far south as a railroad terminal at Spring Street, just north of Canal Street. However, most of the southern section was demolished in 1960, with another small portion being demolished in 1991.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and <b>went</b> <b>as</b> the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E

His mother, Doña Carlota Joaquina, was the daughter of King Don CarlosIV of Spain. Pedro's parents had an unhappy marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, who always sought to advance Spain's interests, even to the detriment of Portugal's.

5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Not everything <b>went</b> <b>as</b> expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar {{near the end of the}} film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.|$|E
