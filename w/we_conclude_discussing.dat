40|$|We {{perform an}} {{explicit}} {{calculation of the}} axial current at finite temperature and rotation in curved space. We discuss {{a connection between the}} chiral vortical effect, the Chern-Simons current, and the gravitational chiral anomaly. This relation is then naturally interpreted in terms of the chiral gap effect, i. e. in terms of the shift of the fermion mass due to finite curvature. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> possible applications to astrophysical compact objects described by the Kerr metric. We argue that the Chern-Simons chiral vortical current may provide a novel universal microscopic mechanism behind the generation of collimated jets from rotating astrophysical compact sources.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a methodology that allows to model behavioral trajectories of users in online social media. First, we illustrate how to leverage the probabilistic framework provided by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to represent users by embedding the temporal sequences of actions they performed online. We then derive a model-based distance between trained HMMs, {{and we use}} spectral clustering to find homogeneous clusters of users showing similar behavioral trajectories. To provide platform-agnostic results, we apply the proposed approach to two different online social media [...] - i. e.

We developed a theoretical model discussing the trade-offs of the several possible EIT configurations, which depend on eleven key dimensions to be considered in shaping the EIT. We carried out a survey among 312 public researchers and applied an ordered probit econometric model to examine which researchers ‟ attributes (years and type of experience, field and orientation of research activities) may explain their preferences towards some EIT configurations. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> the policy implications of the most critical and controversial dimensions...|$|E
40|$|We study {{energy and}} {{particle}} transport for one-dimensional strongly interacting bosons through a single channel connecting two atomic reservoirs. We show {{the emergence of}} particle- and energy- current separation, leading to the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. As a consequence, we predict different time scales for the equilibration of temperature and particle imbalances between the reservoirs. Going beyond the linear spectrum approximation, we show the emergence of ther- moelectric effects, which could be controlled by either tuning interactions or the temperature. Our results describe in a unified picture fermions in condensed matter devices and bosons in ultracold atom setups. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> {{the effects of a}} controllable disorder.

40|$|Abstract*. We {{present a}} method for {{producing}} heuristics to direct the search for solutions in task allocation and scheduling problems. The problems considered consist of allocating and scheduling tasks with precedence and hard real-time constraints into distributed systems. Heuristics are produced in two steps. In the first, examples of promising and unpromising search states are extracted from the search trees of previously solved problems. In the second, using the extracted examples, the C 4. 5 algorithm induces classifiers that label search nodes as promising or unpromising. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> the results of experiments that compare the success ratio and number of nodes visited to solve problems when a search algorithm chooses the next node to be examined using a random heuristic and when it uses the induced classifiers...|$|E

40|$|Harassment bribes - {{payments}} {{people give}} {{in order not}} to be denied what they are legally entitled to – are common in for example India. Kaushik Basu recently made a '’radical'’ proposal to reduce its occurrence: Legalize the act of giving the bribe and double the fine for accepting the bribe! We develop a formal model and delineate circumstances under which Basu’s proposal works well or poorly. We discuss a modified scheme where immunity is conditional on reporting that we argue addresses the main issues raised against the proposal. We highlight complementarities between these schemes and other policies aimed a improving the accountability and performance of the public sector, and of law enforcement agencies in particular. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> the implications for the fight of more harmful forms of corruption.

40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{a system of}} {{interacting}} fermions with large spin and SP(N) symmetry. We contrast their behaviour with the case of SU(N) symmetry by analysing the conserved quantities and the dynamics in each case. We also develop the Fermi liquid theory for fermions with SP(N) symmetry. We find that the effective mass and inverse compressibility are always enhanced {{in the presence of}} interactions, and that the N-dependence of the enhancement is qualitatively different in distinct parameter regimes. The Wilson ratio can be enhanced, indicating that the system can be made closer to a magnetic instability, in contrast to the SU(N) scenario. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> what are the experimental routes to SP(N) symmetry within cold atoms and the exciting possibility to realize physics in higher dimensions in these systems.

We analyze a series of alternative decompositions of the main application tasks and profile each of them by running the corresponding embedded software on three different processors. Based on the profiling measures, we build various alternative embedded platforms by combining different embedded processors, memory modules and network interfaces. In particular, we consider the choice of two possible network technologies: ARCnet and Ethernet. After deriving an analytical model of the network costs, we use it to complete {{an exploration of the}} design space as we scale the number of video cameras in an hypothetical building.

40|$|Designing {{policies}} for water systems management requires {{the capability to}} assess the economic impacts of water availability and to effectively couple water withdrawals by human activities with natural hydrologic dynamics. At the core of any scientific approach to these issues there is the estimation of water withdrawals by industrial sectors {{in the form of}} water coefficients, which are measurements of the quantity of water withdrawn per dollar of GDP or output. In this work we focus on the contiguous United States and on the estimation of water coefficients for regional scale analyses. We first compare an established methodology for the estimation of national water coefficients with a parametric one we propose. Second, we introduce a method to estimate water coefficients at the level of ecological regions and we discuss how they reduce possible biases in regional analyses of water systems. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> advantages and limits of regional water coefficients...|$|E

For the phenomena reviewed, which include: the notion of syntactic head, apposition, control and coordination, we explain how PASSAGE representation relates to other syntactic representation schemes for French and English, slightly extending the annotation to address English when needed.

40|$|Abstract: Commercial Virtual Private Network (VPN) ser-vices {{have become}} a popular and {{convenient}} technology for users seeking privacy and anonymity. They have been applied {{to a wide range}} of use cases, with commercial providers of-ten making bold claims regarding their ability to fulfil each of these needs, e. g., censorship circumvention, anonymity and protection from monitoring and tracking. However, as of yet, the claims made by these providers have not received a suf-ficiently detailed scrutiny. This paper thus investigates the claims of privacy and anonymity in commercial VPN services. We analyse 14 of the most popular ones, inspecting their inter-nals and their infrastructures. Despite being a known issue, our experimental study reveals that the majority of VPN services suffer from IPv 6 traffic leakage. The work is extended by de-veloping more sophisticated DNS hijacking attacks that allow all traffic to be transparently captured. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> a range of best practices and countermeasures that can address these vulnerabilities...|$|E

40|$|There exist non-trivial {{stationary}} {{points of}} the Euclidean action for an axion particle minimally coupled to Einstein gravity, dubbed wormholes. They explicitly break the continuos global shift symmetry of the axion in a non-perturbative way, and generate an effective potential that may compete with QCD depending {{on the value of}} the axion decay constant. In this paper, we explore both theoretical and phenomenological aspects of this issue. On the theory side, we address the problem of stability of the wormhole solutions, and we show that the spectrum of the quadratic action features only positive eigenvalues. On the phenomenological side, we discuss, beside the obvious application to the QCD axion, relevant consequences for models with ultralight dark matter, black hole superradiance, and the relaxation of the electroweak scale. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> wormhole solutions for a generic coset and the potential they generate.

For these WHIM filaments, we derive ionization corrections and, when possible, metallicity estimates. This allows us to obtain refined estimates of the number density of O VII WHIM systems down to the O VII column density sensitivity of our observations, and most importantly, a measurement of the cosmological mass density Omega_b^{WHIM} in the WHIM, at redshift z< 0. 361.

40|$|The consumer's {{experience}} of self-customizing a product with a sales configurator {{can be a}} source of experience-related benefits for the consumer, above and beyond the traditionally considered utility of possessing a product that better fits his/her idiosyncratic needs. Although such experience-related benefits have been found by previous studies as increasing consumers??? willingness to pay for mass-customized products, research on what characteristics sales configurators should have to increase such benefits is still in its infancy. In this paper, we argue that two such benefits (i. e., hedonic and creative-achievement benefits) increase as a sales configurator deploys, to a greater extent, the following capabilities: focused navigation, flexible navigation, user-friendly product space description, easy comparison and benefit-cost communication. Subsequently, by analyzing 675 self-customization experiences made by 75 engineering students on 30 real Web-based configurators of consumer goods, we find empirical support for all the hypothesized relationships. <b>We</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>discussing</b> the contribution of the study to relevant debates, its managerial implications as well as its limitations and the related opportunities for further research...|$|E
