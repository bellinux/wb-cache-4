50|$|The novel follows Jean Finnegan, a {{sensible}} and appealing young seamstress who, {{when the story}} opens in 1934, has earned a billet in the women's car {{at the rear of}} the Better Farming Train that tours Victoria, bringing agricultural science to the man-on-the-land. The rest of the train consists of 14 cars, each dedicated to some aspect of farm labour - a pig car, a cattle car, a sheep car, a <b>wheat</b> <b>car,</b> even a chicken-sexing car run by world-famous Japanese chicken-sexer Mr Ohno, whose admiration manages to unsettle Jean despite his almost non-existent English.|$|E
60|$|Hawtrey strode along briskly {{until he}} reached the open space which divided the little wooden town from the unfenced {{railroad}} track. It was strewn with fine dusty snow, and the huge bulk of the grain elevators towered high above it against the lowering sky. A freight locomotive was just hauling a long string of <b>wheat</b> <b>cars</b> out of a sidetrack. The locomotive stopped presently, and though Hawtrey could not see anything beyond the big cars, he knew by the shouts which broke out that something unusual was going on. He was expecting Sally, who was going east to Brandon by a train due in an hour or two.|$|R
60|$|Hawtrey, however, {{was used}} to that, and strode along briskly {{until he reached the}} open space which divided the little wooden town from the unfenced {{railroad}} track. It was strewn with fine dusty snow, and the huge bulk of the grain elevators towered high above it against the lowering sky. As it happened, a freight locomotive was just hauling a long string of <b>wheat</b> <b>cars</b> out of a side-track amidst a discordant tolling of its bell. It stopped presently, and though Hawtrey could not see anything beyond the big cars he fancied by the shouts which broke out that something unusual was going on. He was expecting Sally, who was going East to Brandon by a train due in an hour or two.|$|R
60|$|At length, on a frosty evening, he saw {{the last}} load vanish into the dusty elevator, and a curious feeling of regret crept over him. It was very {{doubtful}} if he would haul in another harvest, and he wondered whether the time would now and then hang heavily on his hands in England. There was a roar of machinery above him in the tail building that cut sharply against the sky; below, long rows of wagons stood waiting their turn, and {{the voices of the}} teamsters, bantering one another, struck cheerfully on his ears. Side-track and little station were bathed in dazzling electric glare, two locomotives were pushing in <b>wheat</b> <b>cars,</b> and lights had begun to glimmer in the wooden houses of the Butte, though all round there was the vast sweep of prairie.|$|R
25|$|Egypt's main imports {{consist of}} {{pharmaceuticals}} and non-petroleum {{products such as}} <b>wheat,</b> maize, <b>cars</b> and car spare parts. The current account grew from 0.7% of GDP in FY2002 to 3.3% at FY2005. Egypt's Current Account made a surplus of US$4478 million in FY2005 compared to a deficit of US$158 million in FY2004.|$|R

50|$|In the aftermath, Kurt {{is arrested}} {{for using the}} illegal {{substance}} and Mondo Burger is destroyed, with an artificial burger destroying Mr. <b>Wheat's</b> newly repaired <b>car</b> as well. Dexter also tears up the contract he formed with Ed and tells him that he gets to keep all the profits from his sauce. Ed and Dexter then walk back to Good Burger where they are both praised by the other employees as heroes for saving the restaurant.|$|R
30|$|It {{had been}} shown that {{contents}} of Chls in plants are influenced by environmental temperature. It was observed that 18.5  °C significantly increased the content of total Chls in tobacco leaves, whereas exposing to 28.5  °C decreased Chls, when compared with plants grown under 23.5  °C (Fig.  5). Zhao et al. (2011) reported that 36  °C reduced the content of Chls in cucumber leaves. On the other hand, {{it was found that}} treatment with 16 / 14  °C (day/night) increased the level of Chls in lycopersicon leaves (Venema et al. 1999). It was also observed that the degradation rate of Chls is more rapidly than that of Cars in tobacco leaves, and this finding was also reported in other study (Whitfield and Rowan 1974). Additionally, Grover et al. (1986) have demonstrated that the senescence-induced degradation of Chls was faster at 35  °C than that at 25  °C in detached leaves of <b>wheat,</b> and <b>Cars</b> degradation was faster at 25  °C than that at 35  °C.|$|R
500|$|In 1948, {{shortly after}} their third son Tibor was born, the Banathy family {{was moved to}} another camp, near a Marshall Plan warehouse. Bánáthy was {{assigned}} to unload sacks of <b>wheat</b> from railroad <b>cars.</b> He contacted the World Scouting Movement for assistance and began to organize [...] scouting in the DP camps. During 1947, Bánáthy was named the Hungarian Scout Commissioner for Austria; he led training for Hungarian Scout leaders along with his former commanding officer Farkas. [...] He was ordained by the World Council of Churches and became minister for youth among Hungarian refugees. Banathy served as director of religious education of the Protestant Refugee Service of Austria, was editor of a religious youth service and of a Scout publication.|$|R
40|$|Short arm of rye {{chromosome}} 1 (1 RS) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{improvement is}} being widely utilized by many plant breeders. The 1 BL. 1 RS translocation {{derived from the}} Russian <b>wheat</b> cultivar “Kavkaz”, <b>carring</b> genes for major wheat diseases such as stem, strip and leaf rusts and powdery mildew resistance. The 1 AL. 1 RS translocation derived from “Amigo”, possessing resistance genes for stem rust, powdery mildew and greenbug. The distribution of the wheat-rye translocations 1 BL. 1 RS and 1 AL. 1 RS was studied in 44 Iranian wheat cultivars (29 bread wheat cultivars and 15 durum wheats). In this study {{the presence of the}} translocations was identified in 5 cultivars (Dez, Atrak, Rasul, Falat and Moghan 3), using SDS-PAGE technique and 3 DNAmarkers based PCR. The both results of PCR based markers and SDS-PAGE showed that the frequency of the 1 BL. 1 RS in Iranian bread wheat is very low (5 cultivars of bread wheat) and 1 AL. 1 RS did not exist in Iranian wheat backgrounds. Such techniques are quick and reliable tools to recognize and to distinguish these two wheat-rye translocations in wheat genetic background...|$|R
