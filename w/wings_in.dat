5|$|Auditory {{defenses}} {{can also}} be used, which {{in the case of}} the Grizzled skipper refers to vibrations generated by the butterfly upon expanding its <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to communicate with ant predators.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind wings and have {{shortened}} fore <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the fore <b>wings.</b> <b>In</b> Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings longer than fore wings engage in flight.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{school building}} {{was designed by}} architect Alexander Merchant and built in the 1920s. Later additions include the Science and Math <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1958; the English <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1968; the library and arts <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s; and the cafeteria and a connected middle school (grades 6, 7, and 8) in 1996. Student population peaked in the 1960s, with a population in the 900s.|$|R
50|$|Originally in 1923, only The Annex and the Old Eddy wings were constructed. With new {{government}} grants for university residences, Shirreff saw {{the addition of}} the New Eddy <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1962, and the Newcombe <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1967.|$|R
50|$|Ellen Marsvin {{added the}} west <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1631 {{and a low}} south-facing gate <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1634. She is also {{responsible}} for a chapel installed in 1637 richly decorated with wood carvings by Hans Dreier, and a richly decorated knights' hall.|$|R

5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|Bertuzzi's nephew, Tyler Bertuzzi, {{who also}} {{played for the}} Storm and {{currently}} plays for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL), was drafted 58th overall by the Detroit Red <b>Wings</b> <b>in</b> the 2013 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E
50|$|The {{central part}} was {{classified}} as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture in 1922, the right <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1923 and the left <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1924. The castle and gardens are privately owned but {{are open to the}} public.|$|R
50|$|In Hong Kong, {{adults are}} on <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> {{multiple}} generations per year, with records from April to late October (peaks in mid April, late May, mid August and mid October). In Korea, adults are on <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> August. In general though, adults are on wing from April or May to October throughout the southern range.|$|R
50|$|Vaikona {{also played}} for Tonga in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup and was his country's top try-scorer for the tournament. Vaikona {{played for the}} Bradford Bulls on the <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> their 2001 Super League Grand Final victory against the Wigan Warriors.

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Penguins {{finished}} second in the Eastern Conference, behind the Montreal Canadiens. With a 12–2 record in the playoffs, the team eliminated the Senators, the New York Rangers and the Flyers, {{on their way to the}} 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the franchise's first in 16years. The team was defeated in the Stanley Cup Final by the Detroit Red <b>Wings</b> <b>in</b> six games.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{business}} case was developed with three options {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two options involved expanding the service life extension program (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new wings and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was chosen and Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 wings with options for 125 additional <b>wings.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 wings, putting 173 wings on order with options remaining for 69 additional <b>wings.</b> <b>In</b> November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new wings fitted. The new wings improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary. The re-winging effort was organized under the thick-skin urgent spares kitting (TUSK) program.|$|E
2500|$|The wing won the SAC missile combat {{competition}} and the Blanchard Trophy in 1973 and 1984 and in 2010 and 2011 as the best missile <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> Air Force Global Strike Command. It was awarded the Omaha Trophy as the most outstanding <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> SAC in 1983 and in 2007 as the best missile <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> United States Strategic Command. The unit won the Col Lowell F. McAdoo trophy for best missile <b>wing</b> operations <b>in</b> SAC and the Lee R. Williams trophy as the most outstanding missile <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> 1988. [...] <b>In</b> 1989, the <b>wing's</b> maintenance complex won the Chadwell Trophy as the best missile maintenance unit in SAC and repeated in 1992 as the best in Air Combat Command. [...] Individual squadrons of the wing have won other command competition awards, including two additional awards of the Blanchard Trophy.|$|R

5|$|In Africa, the Ewe {{people of}} Ghana, who {{were said to}} have been guided from Dahomey to Ghana by a bird, {{incorporate}} the flapping of the bird's <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> dances such as Agbadza, Atsiagbekor, and Gakpa.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his field lacrosse career, Striebel played one season in 2003 of box lacrosse with the Philadelphia <b>Wings</b> <b>in</b> the National Lacrosse League. Streibel was traded by the Wings to the New York Saints in February 2003. He never appeared in a game for the Saints. Striebel has also played professional soccer for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received more rain and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, there was probably less need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E
50|$|Sullivan was {{selected}} to represent Wales at the 1995 Rugby League World Cup. He played for St Helens on the <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> their 1996 Challenge Cup Final victory over Bradford. At the end of Super League's first season, he was named on the <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> the 1996 Super League Dream Team. Together with Alan Hunte he was the 1997 St. Helens' top try scorer. In the 1997 post season, Sullivan {{was selected}} to play for Great Britain on the <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> the first match of the Super League Test series against Australia. His usual position was on the wing and he was named in this position in 1998's Super League III Super League Dream Team. Sullivan played for St. Helens on the <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> their 1999 Super League Grand Final victory over Bradford. He also played for St Helens on the <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> their 2000 Super League Grand Final victory over Wigan. He played for Wales in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. As Super League V champions, St. Helens played against 2000 NRL Premiers, Brisbane Broncos in the 2001 World Club Challenge. Sullivan played on the <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> Saints' victory. He became a dual-code international when he represented the Wales national rugby union team in 2001.|$|R

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of territoriality, as birds in the Wheatbelt maintain territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and Australian hobby. The species has been observed bathing by shaking its <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.|$|E
5|$|These birds forage on {{the ground}} or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food. While foraging, they {{frequently}} spread their <b>wings</b> <b>in</b> a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|After {{a string}} of financially {{unsuccessful}} films, which included roles as a president of a company who is sued for knocking down a boy in an accident in Born to Be Bad (1934) for 20th Century Fox, a cosmetic surgeon in Kiss and Make-Up (1934), and a blinded pilot opposite Myrna Loy in <b>Wings</b> <b>in</b> the Dark (1935), successive poor box office takings and press reports of his fledging marriage to Cherrill, led Paramount to form the conclusion that Grant was now expendable.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his fourth {{season with the}} <b>Wings</b> <b>in</b> 2011–12, Daavettila signed his first European contract as a free agent, agreeing to a one-year deal with Frederikshavn White Hawks of the Danish AL-Bank Ligaen on June 13, 2012. However {{a little over a}} month later, due to personal reasons, Daavettila sought a release from his contract and was granted on July 30, 2012. On September 13, Daavettila agreed to remain in the ECHL, defecting from the Wings to fellow competitor the Colorado Eagles on a one-year deal.|$|E
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their <b>wings.</b> <b>In</b> the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying <b>wings.</b> <b>In</b> beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
