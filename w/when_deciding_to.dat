25|$|The Egyptian flight, {{having been}} {{authorized}} by its government, was lawful under international law. The Egyptian government protested the American interception of its plane {{which was not}} legal under international law. (Egypt's arguments were somewhat diminished by its own previous justification for its 1978 raid at Locna airport in Cyprus.) Not only had the Americans not gotten consent from the Italians to forcibly land a non-hostile plane flying in compliance with International Law at Sigonella, but the American military action was taken solely for American purposes (not those of the NATO alliance) and was taken {{in order to secure}} criminals – this was in violation of the purely joint military purposes that the Italians had agreed to <b>when</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>to</b> share the utilization the Italian base.|$|E
25|$|A {{functional}} analysis {{is the most}} direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects {{on the behavior of}} interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a {{functional analysis}}, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) {{it can be said that}} there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. <b>When</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>to</b> use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.|$|E
25|$|A {{literary}} masterpiece {{from the}} 13th dynasty talking about Khufu {{is the famous}} Papyrus Westcar, where king Khufu witnesses a magical wonder and receives a prophecy from a magician named Dedi. Within the story, Khufu is characterised in a difficult-to-assess way. At one side he is depicted as ruthless <b>when</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>to</b> have a condemned prisoner decapitated to test the alleged magical powers of Dedi. At the other side Khufu is depicted as inquisitive, reasonable and generous: He accepts Dedi's outrage and his subsequent alternative offer for the prisoner, questions the circumstances and contents of Dedi's prophecy and rewards the magician generously after all. The contradictory depiction of Khufu {{is the object of}} great dispute between Egyptologists and historians to this day. Especially earlier Egyptologists and historians such as Adolf Erman, Kurt Heinrich Sethe and Wolfgang Helck evaluated Khufu's character as heartless and sacrilegious. They lean on the ancient Greek traditions of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, who described an exaggerated negative character image of Khufu, ignoring the paradoxical (because positive) traditions the Egyptians themselves had always taught.|$|E

500|$|Kolbe's {{recognition}} as a Christian martyr also created some controversy within the Catholic Church. While his ultimate self-sacrifice of his life was most certainly considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed strictly speaking out of odium fidei (hatred of the faith), but {{as the result of}} an act of Christian charity. Pope Paul VI himself had recognized this distinction at his beatification by naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title [...] "martyr of charity". Pope John Paul II, however, <b>when</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>to</b> canonize him, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity), wishing {{to make the point that}} the systematic hatred of (whole categories of) humanity propagated by the Nazi regime was in itself inherently an act of hatred of religious (Christian) faith, meaning Kolbe's death equated to martyrdom.|$|E
500|$|By 1987, the Spanish {{army was}} {{equipped}} with 299 French-designed AMX-30Es, assembled by Santa Bárbara Sistemas, and 552 American M47 and M48 Patton tanks. The AMX-30Es were put [...] into service [...] in 1970, while the latter went into service in the mid-1950s. Although Spain's M47s and M48s were modernized to M47Es and M48Es, bringing them to near equivalence with the M60 Patton tank, the Spanish army considered them antiquated. In 1984, <b>when</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>to</b> replace its Patton tanks, the Spanish government declared its intention to produce a whole new main battle tank locally, [...] since known as the Lince. Five companies expressed interest in bidding, including Krauss-Maffei in a partnership with Santa Bárbara Sistemas, GIAT with what became the Leclerc, General Dynamics with the M1 Abrams and Vickers with the Valiant. While the M1Abrams and Valiant bids were not accepted, the bidding continued until 1989 when it was officially canceled.|$|E

This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, [...] "a sense of 'responsibility', or self-agency, {{in a context of}} uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents".|$|E
2500|$|Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court analyzed whether the Environmental Protection Agency must consider costs <b>when</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>to</b> regulate, rather than later in the process of issuing the regulation. Writing for a 5–4 majority, Justice Antonin Scalia held that the EPA must consider costs and that it interpreted the Clean Air Act unreasonably when it determined that it did not need to consider costs when it issued a [...] "finding" [...] that it was [...] "necessary and appropriate" [...] to regulate. Critics of the Environmental Protection Agency praised the Court's decision, while other commentators criticized Justice Scalia's decision to ignore health impacts in his opinion. Some commentators suggested that the decision may derail President Barack Obama's climate change agenda entirely.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the use {{of animals}} such as bears and pigs were tested in car {{stimulation}} crashes. This led to moral dilemmas and {{was not the first}} time that animals were used in car crashes. In 1978, The University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute used baboons to be tested as a substitute for humans in car crashes. Although there was the objection of animal cruelty that arose, there was also the controversy of how they are similar to humans and can be used as a sufficient testing substitution for us. The researchers did not end up stopping {{the use of}} baboons because of moral objections, but instead stopped because they found sufficient data. [...] The moral inputs from other people and organizations were inconsistent, which caused implications <b>when</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>to</b> ban healthy animals from research testing. The animals were put under anesthesia, so there was no pain put upon them, but the aftereffects can not justify this. The General Motors corporation used animals for testing, and also suggested that they put the animals under anesthesia and then would kill the animals after the testing is complete.|$|E
