40|$|An {{adaptive}} slicing algorithm {{that can}} vary the layer thickness {{in relation to}} local geometry is presented. The algorithm is based on three fundamental concepts: (i) choice of criterion for accommodating complexities of surfaces, (ii) recognition of key characteristics and features of the object, and (iii) development of a grouping methodology for facets used to represent the object. Four criteria, cusp height, maximum deviation, chord length and volumetric error per unit length, are identified and the layer thickness is adjusted such {{that one of the}} four is met. Next, key characteristics of the object, such as horizontal and vertical surfaces, pointed edges and ends, are identified based on the local changes in surface complexity, and slice based feature recognition is introduced to identify the nature of a feature, protrusion or depression, by studying the slice data. Note that the present approach uses information only from the tessellated model, and thus is different from current implementations. Finally, the concept of grouping of the facets based on their vertex coordinates is developed to minimize the number of searches for possible intersection of the facets with a slice plane. The slicing algorithm is interfaced with adaptive laminated machining and the stereolithography process through a CNC post processor and a hatching algorithm respectively. A comparison of the estimated surface quality and build time indicates that adaptive slicing produces superior parts in a shorter build time.

40|$|Copyright law <b>is</b> {{designed}} to <b>protect</b> the ownership and financial {{rights of the}} original author of a literary work.

Such fan <b>works</b> should <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the Fair Use Defense, but the power imbalance between amateur fan fiction authors and successful published authors often leads to the eradication of fan stories from the public domain. This Comment argues that fan fiction should be defined as universally transformative so as to avoid any possibility of infringement lawsuits {{on the basis of a}} derivative work that, by law, belongs only to the original author. Such a legal definition is favorable due to the sociological and literary benefits that fan fiction has for the public at large, due to its ability to create and perpetuate modern myths...|$|R

It is automatic once a tangible medium of expression in any form of an innovative material, which conforms the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA 1988), is created. This includes the building, the architectural plans and drawings. There is no official copyright registry, no requirements on any fees need to be paid {{and they can be}} published or unpublished materials. Copyrights owners have the rights to control the reproduction, display, publication, and even derivation of the design. However, there are limitations {{on the rights of the}} copyright owners concerning copyrights infringements. Infringement of copyright is an unauthorised violation of the exclusive rights of the copyright author. Architects and engineers depend on copyright law to protect their works and design. Copyrights <b>are</b> <b>protected</b> on the arrangements of spaces and elements as well as the overall form of the architectural design. However, it does not cover the design of functional elements and standard features. Although copyright law provides automatic protection to all original architectural plans, the limitation is that copyright only protects the expression of ideas but not the ideas themselves. It can be argued that architectural drawings and design, including models are recognised categories of artistic <b>works</b> which <b>are</b> <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the copyright law.

40|$|Street art is {{visual art}} created in public spaces, many {{times at the}} behest of the {{communities}} in which the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> created. It is a derivative of graffiti, which is the illicit marking of public locations, usually on buildings or train cars. Retailers’ appropriation of street art and graffiti is becoming commonplace, causing confusion in the market. As a result, street artists have filed an increasing number of copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits to protect their intellectual property rights. There is a debate regarding whether these artists are entitled to trademark protection given the expressive nature of their marks. Courts are reluctant to grant trademark protection since expressive <b>works</b> <b>are</b> traditionally <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> copyright law. Most street artists, as opposed to creators of “fine art,” however, use marks in a trademark manner to build reputations and identify the source of their works. This Note argues that courts should broadly interpret the Lanham Act’s “use in commerce” requirement to validate marks used by street artists. Street art substantially affects commerce and therefore should be covered by the Commerce Clause. Abroad interpretation furthers Congress’s intent under trademark law to prevent consumer confusion. In the alternative, this Note contemplates treatment of street artists under the eleemosynary standard reiterated by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2001 in Planetary Motion Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc., and considers the possibility of adding a famous mark exception to the use in commerce requirement...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} six decades, the right of {{publicity}} has been developed almost {{as quickly as the}} world around it. As major advances in film and computer technology have allowed content producers to depict real people in their works in a plethora of new ways, the people depicted have used the right of publicity to challenge many of these uses. As a result, courts have been faced with constantly remolding the right of publicity to account for these technological advances. As a creature of state law, the development of the right of publicity has varied across the country, with little guidance from the Supreme Court or Congress. However, courts across the circuits have consistently recognized that the property right granted by the right of publicity must be balanced against the First Amendment rights of the creators of expressive works. Ultimately, courts have developed a number of tests to balance the right of publicity against the First Amendment. One such test, the “transformative test,” was developed by the California Supreme Court and has been used in a number of circuits. This Comment argues that though the transformative test may have been appropriate when used in the context it was created, traditional still artistic depictions, it has been overextended and is ill-suited for the analysis of interactive media such as video games. Specifically, this Comment takes issue with a standard announced by the California Supreme Court, in No Doubt v. Activision Publishing Inc., and then followed by the Ninth Circuit in Keller v. Electronic Arts. This standard, now used by courts when applying the transformative test to video games, states that literal depictions of celebrities within <b>works</b> will not <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the First Amendment if the celebrity is depicted doing what they became famous for. This Comment demonstrates that this standard is in direct conflict with case precedent in a variety of contexts including: art, film, and literature. Ultimately, this Comment contends that a new test must be crafted to balance the right of publicity with the First Amendment. Such a test must possess the flexibility to analyze both simple artistic depictions and depictions within more complex interactive media. This Comment offers one such test, which borrows and adapts language from the transformative test and the Rogers Test, to create a method of analysis that is better suited for application to both simple and complex media of expression. ...|$|R
40|$|With major {{recording}} artist Thom Yorke predicting {{the record industry}} will crumble in “Months” (Hudson, 2010), and sensationalist headlines such as “iPods and Young People Have Utterly Destroyed Music” (Buchanan, 2009) becoming commonplace, this research attempts to determine {{the current state of}} New Zealand music in the digital age. Despite the doom and gloom coming from the press in regards to the music industry, musicians haven’t stopped continuing to record, release, and promote their music as the costs of doing so continues to decline with the advent of new technologies. This research looks specifically into the music hosting website Bandcamp and determines what methods New Zealand musicians are currently using on the site {{in an effort to get}} their music into the ears and onto the hard drives of fans. Although a large amount of research has been performed on the impacts of piracy on music sales, very little has been conducted on what strategies musicians are implementing to increase their exposure and connect with their fan base in the 21 st century, with no specific research having been performed on the unique circumstances faced by artists in New Zealand. This paper first presents a historical overview of the music industry in the last century, as well as a summary of where the industry currently stands in regards to Copyright, distribution methods, and price models in order to provide perspective on the difficulties and variety of choices currently facing musicians. Within this research paper, several hypotheses were tested in order to determine what factors have a significant effect on the amount of exposure that an artist has received for their music. In order to test these hypotheses, the number of audio streams and downloads that an artist has received for their songs posted to the music hosting site Bandcamp was used as a measure to determine the amount of exposure that a specific artist has received. Due to the subjective nature of the quality of music which each musician creates, a survey was sent to over 500 New Zealand musicians whom provided at least one song for download on the website in order to gather as much overall data on the success generated by New Zealand musicians online as possible. A quantitative analysis was then performed to determine what social networking and music hosting sites are most popular with Kiwi artists; whether musicians are still creating physical copies of their works; and what licenses and payment models artists are applying to their songs. This analysis identified two important factors as statistically significant in terms of affecting the number of downloads and audio streams an artist receives on Bandcamp, the length of time that an artist has been present on the site and the payment model that an artist applies to their works. In addition to the quantitative analysis performed on the success that artists were achieving on Bandcamp, a qualitative analysis was performed on the motivations artists had for applying specific pricing models and licenses to their works. The results of this analysis found a nearly unanimous positive response from musicians who had applied traditional Copyright to their work when asked if they would allow their fans to share their music without expressed permission. This research also determined that a majority of musicians currently applying traditional Copyright to their <b>works</b> <b>are</b> unfamiliar, unaware, or uninformed about Creative Commons licenses, with traditional Copyright being applied more out of habit than a desire for their <b>works</b> to <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the rights granted under traditional Copyright. A discussion about what these results indicate for artists is also presented as a guide for future and current musicians looking to upload their music to Bandcamp, depending on the goals that the musician is looking to achieve with their music. Finally, this paper concludes with an analysis of what limitations are present in the results of the research, as well as where the need exists for future research...|$|R
