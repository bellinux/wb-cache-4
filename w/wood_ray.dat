50|$|In this context, {{the term}} refers to radial sheets or ribbons {{extending}} vertically through the tree across and {{perpendicular to the}} growth rings.

30|$|Here, two {{effects are}} {{brought about by}} {{adhesive}}. First, the adhesive covered {{on the surface of}} wood cells protects the cells against absorbing moisture. This improves the water resistance of compreg. Second, the bonding effect between the same or different wood cells, such as fibers, vessels, and <b>wood</b> <b>rays</b> leads to the connection of the organizations. The interacted force offered by the adhesive restricts the rebounding of dimension due to absorbance of moisture.|$|R

50|$|Ram Ray was {{the most}} popular game in the show. It {{involved}} the dwarf stuntman Ray (played by actor Raymond Griffiths) charging into a set of five doors, four wooden, one made of paper. A caller would select a door, hoping it to be made of paper. Ray would then charge at a door and either run through it if it was made of paper or slam into it and fall backwards if it was made of <b>wood.</b> <b>Ray</b> would often fall and roll across the floor of the studio rather dramatically, and he was often checked {{to see if he was}} hurt (although Stephen often found his collisions hilarious). To suit the theme of an episode, Ray would often wear a matching costume.|$|E
30|$|As {{apparent}} from Fig.  5, {{most of the}} pores inside the vessel and fiber narrowed and disappeared in the 1.20  g/cm 3 compreg exerting an influence on the liquid entrance into wood. Therefore, more mechanical bonding between adhesive and wood cells appeared in compreg, and it showed better water resistance. In addition, the cured PF resins filled in the gaps between vessels, fibers, and the <b>wood</b> <b>rays</b> {{can be observed in}} the SEM image of compreg sample (see Fig.  5 b).|$|R

50|$|Born in London in November 1953, O'Regan {{grew up in}} Barnes, West London and {{attended}} St Benedict's School, following which he was offered a place at nearby Ealing Art College, famously attended a generation before by rock elite Freddie Mercury, Keith Richards, Ronnie <b>Wood,</b> <b>Ray</b> Davies and Pete Townshend. However, parental influence prevailed and he was temporarily diverted towards {{a position in the}} City of London as a trainee broker at Willis Faber & Dumas, then as a trainee underwriter at Lloyd's of London. Prior to this orthodox career move, O'Regan had seen The Beatles at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1964 with his mother, Marie. In the early 1970s, he smuggled a camera into the same venue to photograph Paul McCartney and Queen. Inspired by seeing Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page perform at Alexandra Palace, and David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust at Hammersmith, O'Regan taught himself photography. He resigned his day job, toured Europe on a student rail pass, and returned to comprehensively document the readily-accessible Punk explosion in London. A major contributor to NME in the late Seventies, O'Regan combined his love of photography and travel when in the Eighties he toured with some of the world's top rock bands, including those he had grown up with as a fan.|$|E

They became early performers on the London pub rock circuit, before Hall left and Iain Whitmore, who'd been in Patches with Leo Sayer, took over on bass. They appeared at ZigZag Magazine's fifth anniversary concert at The Roundhouse on 28 April 1974, which was recorded, but not released until 2010.

5000|$|Conferring first gained {{prominence}} in the book One to one: the art of art of conferring with young writers by Lucy Calkins, Amanda Hartman, and Zoe Ryder White. In the work, Calkins and her co-writers describe how effective writing workshops for students included individual writing conferences (conferring), where teachers would sit and talk with their students about their writing. Per the book, [...] "Conferring can give us the force that makes our mini-lessons and curriculum development and assessment and everything else more powerful. It gives us an endless resource of teaching wisdom, an endless source of accountability, a {{system of checks and}} balances. And, it gives us laughter and human connection-the understanding of our children that gives spirit to our teaching." [...] Calkins believed that there were three main components to every conferring session: Research, Decide and Teach. Research focused on where the student was in their current writing, decide would help the teacher choose what to teach the student, and teach would use modeling and guiding practice to further advance student learning. In their book The Writing Workshop, Katie <b>Wood</b> <b>Ray</b> and Lester L. Laminack added a fourth component in where after the teaching portion the student and/or the teacher would [...] "Make a Record". [...] This modified model can be thought in the terms of: research, decide, teach, record. The benefits of using conferring have been documented in a couple of studies.|$|E

5000|$|Coached by Ralph Jones, the 1914-15 Fighting Illini men's {{basketball}} team {{became the first}} undefeated Big Ten champion {{in the history of}} the school as well as the fourth Big Ten National Champion. [...] That 1915season was the third in the eight-year tenure of head coach Ralph Jones and it produced the only unbeaten season in Illini history and the first Big Ten title for the Illinois basketball program. The Illinois team was retroactively named national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Jones’ 1915 team scored twice as many points as its opponents and won the conference title by three games over Chicago. The arrival of the Woods brothers in 1914 had a lot to do with the success of this era. Guard <b>Ray</b> <b>Woods</b> was named first-team All-America all three years he competed (1915-17), and twin brother Ralf, a forward, led the team in scoring in both 1916 and 1917. His consistency at the free throw line led to the establishmentof the Ralf Woods Award, which is still given annually to the Fighting Illini player with the best free-throw percentage. The starting lineup included Frank Bane at center, Clyde Alwood and Edward Allan Williford at the forward postitons, captain Sven Duner at guard and brothers Ralf <b>Woods</b> and <b>Ray</b> <b>Woods.</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Woods</b> was named an All-American during this season.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{material}} {{model for}} softwood is presented where a combined lamiate and hon-eycomb model of wood is used. The model considers the influence from density {{variations in the}} annual rings, the cellular structure of wood, and the reinforcement from the <b>wood</b> <b>rays.</b> A numerical example that uses the material model is presented where stochastic optimization with the simulated annealing method (SA) is performed on a violin top made of Norway spruce (Picea Abies).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multiscale homogenization model for macroscopic diffusion properties of wood. After a short introduction the physical background of steady-state diffusion processes in wood will be highlighted, {{resulting in a}} physically motivated macroscopic description of diffusion processes with only one diffusion equation and thus one diffusion tensor. This macroscopic diffusion tensor is derived by revisiting the morphological structure of wood {{in the framework of}} continuum micromechanics. The starting point is the cellular structure of wood; further homogenization steps include <b>wood</b> <b>rays</b> and the succession of annual rings. The quality of the model is assessed by a comparison of model predictions and measured values at different temperatures and moisture contents...|$|R
40|$|A micromechanical {{model is}} {{presented}} that predicts the stiffness of wood tissues in their three principal anatomical directions, across various hardwood species. The wood polymers cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, {{common to all}} wood tissues, serve as the starting point. In seven homogenisation steps, the stiffnesses of these polymers {{are linked to the}} macroscopic stiffness. The good agreement of model predictions and corresponding experimental data for ten different European and tropical species confirms the functionality and accuracy of the model. The model enables investigating the influence of individual microstructural features on the overall stiffness. This is exploited to elucidate the mechanical effects of vessels and ray cells. Vessels are shown to reduce the stiffness of wood at constant overall density. This supports that a trade-off exists between the hydraulic efficiency and the mechanical support in relation to the anatomical design of <b>wood.</b> <b>Ray</b> cells are shown to act as reinforcing elements in the radial direction...|$|E
40|$|After felling, beech wood may form thyloses, {{blocking}} the xylem vessels, {{so that they}} can not be sufficiently impregnated with creosote. This decreases the durability and value of the wood for such purposes as railway sleepers. Ebes found that thyloses may be formed throughout the year through pits from <b>wood</b> <b>ray</b> cells next to the xylem vessels. Trials with small logs showed that thyloses appeared sooner at higher temperatures. After a loss of 40 - 45 % moisture no more thyloses appeared. Fresh uptake of moisture induced further thyloses, unless moisture dropped below about 60 %. Ebes confirmed Klein's observation (1923) that when water was pressed through a branch and air through one of its laterals, the branch developed no thyloses, while the lateral formed many. From this it was concluded that the penetration of air into the vessels caused formation of the thyloses. To limit thyloses trees should be felled in a season with low temperatures, and drying of the timber should be encouraged by sawing the wood early. More experiments were needed to find how quickly railway sleepers dried. <p/...|$|E

The existence of the intercellular spaces was examined for 109 wood species. Then the morphological characteristics of the intercellular spaces were observed. The results are as follows; 1. Among all of the wood species examined in this study, the intercellular spaces along the ray were observed. 2. The intercellular spaces look like a narrow tube, and are running continuously from bark to xylem through cambium. 3. The cross sectional areas and the relative volumes of the intercellular spaces in wood were measured, and shown in Table 2. 4. Pit-like structures toward the intercellular spaces were observed {{on the surface of}} the ray parenchyma lumina, and it seems probably that by these structures the intercellular spaces and the ray parenchyma lumina are interconnected. Consequently, it may be assumed that the intercellular spaces along the ray have played a role of a canal system for the ray parenchyma cells in tree...|$|E

30|$|In {{the middle}} part of {{earlywood}} in the tenth annual ring from the cambium (middle {{part of the}} intermediate wood), elliptical nuclei were observed in the ray parenchyma cells (a white arrow in Fig.  5 c). Some vacuoles were obviously deformed and contained almost no protein (a white arrowhead in Fig.  5 c). These deformed vacuoles had an irregular profile. By contrast, vacuoles that contained proteins were not deformed and had a smooth profile (a black arrowhead {{on the left side}} in Fig.  5 c). In the middle part of the earlywood of the eleventh annual ring from the cambium (inner part of the intermediate <b>wood),</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells had elliptical nuclei (a white arrow in Fig.  5 d). The number of deformed vacuoles in each of the ray parenchyma cells tended to be greater than in the tenth annual ring from the cambium (white arrowheads in Fig.  5 e). In addition, there were more ray parenchyma cells with deformed vacuoles than in the tenth annual ring from the cambium. Moreover, some large vacuoles had been observed but they had contained almost no protein (a black arrow in Fig.  5 d). In some ray parenchyma cells, we observed both deformed vacuoles and large vacuoles (a black arrow and white arrowheads in Fig.  5 d, e).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the wood and charcoal anatomy of charcoalproducing tree species and to investigate the alteration in wood macrostructure induced by charring. Eight hardwood species that are used for charcoal production in Central Sudan, were selected. The eight species were Acacia nilotica, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Acacia senegal, Acacia mellifera, Balanties aegyptiaca, Acacia seyal, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Prosopis chilensis. Each species was represented by five randomly chosen branches for each tree and these branches were felled. One meter length with mid diameter ranged between 5 and 10 cm were cross-cut as wood samples (billets), some of these samples were obtained from the stems and others from branches of each tree. A 10 cm long disc was taken {{from one end of the}} billets and used for the preparation of the samples needed to study wood micro-structure by using, a grid, computer screen (monitor), camera and light microscope. The other parts of the billets (about 90 cm long) was used to produce charcoal to study its macro-structure by using hand lens and constructing an identification key to distinguish the wood species from which charcoal was produced. The results revealed great wood variation among charcoal-producing species in the proportion of wood substance, distinctiveness of growth ring and the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of vessels, fiber, parenchyma and <b>wood</b> <b>ray.</b> In the charcoalified wood of all species, the fibers were not distinct. Some of the macroanatomical features, which were distinct in the wood samples, could not be seen in the charcoal samples of the same species (e. g. parenchyma arrangement and rays). The variation in the macro-anatomical characteristics of charcoal among species was sufficient to facilitate identification of the wood from which it was produced. A dichotomous key was prepared to distinguish among the studied species...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood of 42 collections of 23 species of Ephedra from North and South America; data on bark anatomy are offered {{for most of}} these. For five collections, root as well as stem wood is analyzed, and for two collections, anatomy of horizontal underground stems is {{compared to that of}} upright stems. Vessel diameter, vessel element length, fiber-tracheid length, and tracheid length increase with age. Vessels and tracheids bear helical thickenings in 10 North American species (first report); thickenings are absent in Mexican and South American species. Mean total area of perforations per mm 2 of transection is more reliable as an indicator of conductive demands than mean vessel diameter or vessel area per mm 2 of transection. Perforation area per mm 2 is greatest in lianoid shrubs and treelike shrubs, less in large shrubs, and least in small shrubs. Plant size is roughly proportional to ecology, and thus perforation area per mm 2 is indicative also of ecology. Growth rings are not marked in lianoid or tropical or subtropical species. Latewood has few or no vessels (and thus offers maximal conductive safety) in species from colder and drier habitats. The ecology of the species range from dry to extremely dry habitats. Rays are mostly wide multiseriate, but three tropical or subtropical species have uniseriate rays plus narrow multiseriate rays-possibly a primitive condition. The fiber-tracheids (parenchyma of other authors) are nucleated, and are considered a result oftracheid dimorphism phylogenetically. Tracheids are vaguely storied in a few species. Minute calcium oxalate crystals cover outer surfaces of <b>wood</b> <b>ray</b> cells, phloem ray cells, sieve cells, and phloem parenchyma abundantly in most species; the crystals are slightly less abundant on vessel, tracheid, and fiber-tracheid surfaces (first report of these crystals on these cell types). Crystals, tannins, and five types of sclerenchyma in bark are considered types of herbivore deterrents. Bark of some species is richer in these features; other species are poor in sclerenchyma or tannins or both. Independent evolution of vessels in Gnetales and angiosperms is briefly discussed...|$|E
