5|$|Baby Connor was a {{main focus}} of season three, but the creators were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{limitations}} of a baby character. With Connor’s initial role in plot decided, they came up with the concept of a 'teenage' version for further appearances.|$|E
5|$|Hergé later {{concluded}} that the scene in which Tintin hoodwinked the Inca with {{his knowledge of the}} sun was implausible, suggesting that solar worshipers with a keen knowledge of astronomy like the Inca would have been <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the sun and its eclipses.|$|E
5|$|As {{evident in}} his {{imperial}} edicts, the Hongwu Emperor was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the Buddhist link between Tibet and China and wanted to foster it. Rolpe Dorje, 4th Karmapa Lama (1340–1383) rejected the Hongwu Emperor's invitation, although he did send some disciples as envoys to the court in Nanjing. The Hongwu Emperor also entrusted his guru Zongluo, one of many Buddhist monks at court, to head a religious mission into Tibet in 1378–1382 {{in order to obtain}} Buddhist texts.|$|E

60|$|Orpin {{feared that}} he {{understood}} {{the meaning of the}} last words too <b>well,</b> but, being <b>aware</b> that Hintza was regarded by the colonists as one of the friendliest of the Kafir chiefs, he hoped that he might be mistaken.|$|R
5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, {{he learned}} to fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E
5|$|By 1968 the Americans were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the scope}} and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|By dawn on 20 April 1941, the Germans were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that British and Allied {{forces had}} begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece.

"My dear Mrs. Annesley," [...] said Mrs. Crabtree, consoling her in {{that she}} would not be far removed from her child, [...] "you can almost see the brewery {{chimneys}} from the church tower." [...] Those who knew the two ladies <b>well</b> were <b>aware</b> that there was some little slur intended by the allusion to brewery chimneys. Mrs. Crabtree's girl had married the third son of Sir Reginald Rattlepate. The Rattlepates were not rich, and the third son was not inclined to earn his bread.|$|R
5|$|Officers in {{the field}} were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote {{that this was just}} an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, Art Modell died in Baltimore {{at the age}} of 87. Although the Browns {{planned to}} have a moment of silence on their home opener for their former owner, his family asked the team not to, <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the less-than-friendly {{reaction}} it was likely to get. Weeden started the Browns' first game of the season. The 28-year-old rookie threw four interceptions in a 17–16 loss to Philadelphia in which the Browns' only touchdown was scored by the defense.|$|E
5|$|Sir David Lindsay {{would have}} been <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{symbolic}} allusions of the carvings.

6000|$|At {{the same}} time, {{according}} to Reichel and Mr. Leaf, the poet of Book X. introduces the small round Ionian buckler, thus showing his utter {{ignorance of the}} great Mycenaean shield. The ignorance was most unusual and quite inexcusable, for any one who reads {{the rest of the}} Iliad (which the poet of Book X. knew <b>well)</b> is <b>aware</b> that the Homeric shields were huge, often covering body and legs. This fact the poet of Book X. did not know, in Reichel's opinion. [Footnote: Leaf, Iliad, vol. i. p. 575] ...|$|R
60|$|This is the Highland patronymic of {{the late}} gallant Chief of Glengarry. The allusion in the text is to an {{unnecessary}} alarm taken by some lady, at the ceremonial of the coronation of George IV., {{at the sight of}} the pistols which the Chief wore as a part of his Highland dress. The circumstance produced some confusion, which was talked of at the time. All who knew Glengarry (and the author knew him <b>well)</b> were <b>aware</b> that his principles were of devoted loyalty to the person of his sovereign.|$|R
30|$|All estimations {{were carried}} out for the pooled sample and for gender-separated samples. Moreover, to explore {{potential}} heterogeneity in the effects with respect to socio-economic status or background of the individuals, we considered four subgroups as <b>well.</b> Being <b>aware</b> of strong intergenerational patterns of university attendance, we estimated the effects of tuition fees for students with parents possessing tertiary education and those without. Finally, we took into account parents’ position in their job (as an indicator of potential financial supporting ability) and distinguished {{between high and low}} positions.|$|R
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the transformations that {{were taking place}} and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in {{the manner of the}} Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E

40|$|For {{economic}} and humanitarian reasons, the present trend to institutionalize elderly {{people who could}} remain {{in their own homes}} if they were given adequate support, must be challenged. It is important that the family physician, who knows his patients' needs <b>well,</b> is <b>aware</b> of the resources available. When these are deficient, or poorly coordinated, efforts must be made to improve them. After the patient has been properly assessed, the key to proper alternate services is the availability of a coordinated continuum of care, which includes day hospitals, day therapy centres, social daycare centres and a comprehensive home care program...|$|R
5|$|Following the July 20 Plot, Model was {{the first}} senior {{commander}} to reaffirm his loyalty to Hitler. However, he also {{refused to give up}} General Hans Speidel, his chief of staff at Army Group B who was heavily implicated in the plot, to the Gestapo. Model was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge. Like them, he shielded Speidel for as long as possible, while ignoring such treasonous talk as might take place.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was <b>well</b> <b>aware.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter {{was the only time}} that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|Manstein favoured an {{immediate}} pincer {{attack on the}} Kursk salient after the battle at Kharkov, but Hitler was concerned that such a plan would draw forces away from the industrial region in the Donets Basin. In any event, the ground was still too muddy to move the tanks into position. In lieu of {{an immediate}} attack, the OKH prepared Operation Citadel, the launching {{of which would be}} delayed while more troops were gathered in the area and the mud solidified. Meanwhile, the Red Army, <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the danger of encirclement, also moved in large numbers of reinforcements, and their intelligence reports revealed the expected locations and timing of the German thrusts.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The Germans were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that {{breaking}} the blockade {{was very important}} for the Soviet side. However, due to the reverse at Stalingrad and the Soviet offensive at Velikiye Luki to the south of Leningrad, Army Group North was ordered to go on the defensive and was stripped of many troops. The 11th Army, which was to lead the assault on Leningrad in September 1942, and which had thwarted the last Soviet offensive, was transferred to Army Group Center in October. Nine other divisions were also reassigned to other sectors.|$|E

50|$|Canadian Aero Service Limited ("Canaero") was {{a company}} whose main {{business}} was topographical mapping and geophysical exploration.

After the acquisition of Canaero's parent by Litton Industries in 1961, Wells resigned as director in February 1965. O'Malley and Zarzycki resigned from their positions in August 1966. <b>Wells</b> was <b>aware</b> the latter were discontented at Canaero by reason of the limitations upon their authority and the scope of independent action imposed by the Litton company, and they also feared loss of position if Canaero should fail to get contracts.|$|R
