5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|The Romans had {{a greater}} {{appreciation}} for the color green; it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> Venus, the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.|$|E
25|$|Two kit {{versions}} of the Chrysler Turbine Car were significant - a standard bronze colored promotional authentic to the cars used by the public, and a white version that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> one of the test mules, which was also lent for {{the making of the}} movie The Lively Set. This model had a friction motor and fewer than 500 were produced. Some of the Turbine models were nearly as incredible as the real car, with such details as folding seats, opening doors, hood, deck lid, and steerable front wheels. Chassis detail was remarkable, accurately depicting the huge ducting passages running the length of the car needed to expel the turbine's waste gasses.|$|E

2500|$|The old fort's {{administrative}} annex, which {{survived the}} construction of Taylor's Customs House, was enlisted as the Presidential offices by Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s and his successor, Domingo Sarmiento, who beautified the drab building with patios, gardens and wrought-iron grillwork, had the exterior painted pink reportedly in order to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the country's two opposing political parties: red <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the Federales, while white <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the Unitarians. [...] An alternative explanation suggests that the original paint contained cow's blood to prevent damage {{from the effects of}} humidity. Sarmiento also authorized {{the construction of}} the Central Post Office next door in 1873, commissioning Swedish Argentine architect Carl Kihlberg, who designed this, one of the first of Buenos Aires' many examples of Second Empire architecture.|$|E

2500|$|At that period, Vasettha, {{there was}} just one mass of water, and all was darkness, {{blinding}} darkness....

2500|$|References to Johnny Appleseed {{abound in}} popular culture. Johnny Appleseed is a {{character}} in Neil Gaiman's American Gods.

Rock music bands NOFX, Guided by Voices, and Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros have all released songs titled [...] "Johnny Appleseed", as have Grammy-winning American pastoral duo Eric Tingstad and Nancy Rumbel. [...] "Johnny Appleseed" [...] also featured in a comic series in The Victor in the UK in the early sixties. In Philip Roth's novel American Pastoral, the central character imagines himself as Johnny Appleseed when he moves from Newark to a rural community; in this case the figure stands for an innocent, childlike version of the American pioneer spirit. The Japanese role-playing game Wild Arms 5 mentions Johnny Appleseed as a central figure in the plotline.|$|E
