5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, the point most {{emphasized}} in media coverage of the game <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Wake Forest had not won an ACC championship in football since 1970. The point spread for the game was relatively constant, with spread bettors favoring Georgia Tech by a single point.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the state court did {{not take into account}} Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E

5|$|Compounding matters <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed {{contracts with the}} production which ensured {{that they would not}} appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the origin and early years of Jakub Świnka, except for his mention in a {{document}} issued by Bolesław the Pious. As Archbishop of Gniezno, the cooperation between him and Przemysł II was excellent.

5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> voters {{did not know about}} him and his candidacy.

In contrast, 0% of the public had never heard of Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E
5|$|Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live (also called Back to Business) was {{the third}} concert {{residency}} by American recording artist Beyoncé. Announced in March, and held during four consecutive nights in May 2012 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the concerts {{were part of the}} opening of the new entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. Beyoncé stated that her alter ego Sasha Fierce was brought back to life for the performances and the main concept <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the birth of her first baby made her more grounded. She promoted the shows by projecting images and releasing behind-the-scenes footage on her official website.|$|E
5|$|When fielding, Barnes {{stationed}} {{himself as}} close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point. The report of the tour in the 1949 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, stated that Barnes's fielding was as important a factor as his batting in The Invincibles success: Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler running up, but equally important <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction. The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians.|$|E

5|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, {{another factor}} that complicated relations between the Natchez and the colonists <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure. The French assumed that the Great Sun, {{the chief of the}} Grand Village, also held sway over all the other Natchez villages. In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the villages of Flour and Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British villages of White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. When the Great Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more powerful than the pro-French villages centered at Natchez.|$|E
5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, {{everyone}} {{can use the}} Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, {{as long as it}} is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have been hidden.|$|E
5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those who gathered around the pit, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E

5|$|Groves and Parsons {{met with}} Lauritsen and Bruce Sage, who {{had built the}} China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made, and {{it was agreed that}} Caltech would build and operate the plant. A site was chosen in the Salt Wells Valley and work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent, at a cost of $13 million. Groves wanted the plant working within 100 days. While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components for one or two bombs, it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the months to come. Complicating the construction program <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Los Alamos had not finalized what processes would be used.|$|E
5|$|Imagine {{is set in}} post-apocalyptic Tokyo. In {{the events}} leading up to Imagine, which were {{depicted}} in Shin Megami Tensei. Humanity began experimenting with new technologies during the 1990s: among the discoveries made <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> all life and reality was made up of data. When demons began appearing across the world, chaos ensued with the rising of opposing factions supported by human sympathizers: servants of God who sought to bring order, and servants of Lucifer who spread chaos. The conflict culminated into the international launching of ICBMs, which devastated the world and left humanity at the mercy of demons. During the events of Shin Megami Tensei, a group of young people defied both God and Lucifer in creating a world where humans could flourish again.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Iranian {{students}} {{seized the}} American embassy in Tehran {{and held the}} embassy staff hostage; the first rescue operation, code-named Eagle Claw ended in failure due to equipment and coordination problems, culminating in the crash of a RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter into a parked C-130 Hercules in the Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen. A second rescue attempt, Operation Credible Sport, was ordered, and Brown was involved in planning and preparation. The follow-up rescue included U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and Army assets. The Army units involved were the battalions {{that made up the}} 101st Aviation Group: the 158th Aviation Battalion, the 229th Aviation Battalion and the 159th Aviation Battalion. All three battalions formed Task Force 158. President Carter meanwhile appointed the former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral James L. Holloway, III, to head a commission to study the deficiencies revealed by the failure of Eagle Claw. Among the presented findings <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the military lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform these mission types.|$|E

5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding to the difficulty of the situation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E
5|$|Named to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated {{the same}} year. Pope Gregory III {{sent him a}} pallium in 736. He may have been {{appointed}} by Æthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. Whether or not he owed his appointment to Æthelbald, Nothhelm {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence. He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington. A significant feature of this synod <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> no king attended, but yet the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.|$|E
5|$|Pundits {{and fans}} who opposed Kansas' {{selection}} {{pointed to the}} Jayhawks' strength of schedule, which {{at one point during}} the season was as low as 109th out of 119Division I teams. By the time of the BCS selection, however, Kansas's strength of schedule had climbed by a small amount, reaching 88th in the Sagarin rankings and 74th in the CBS rankings. The final rankings rated Kansas' schedule as more difficult than Hawaii, which was also selected to play in the BCS. Aggravating the situation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Kansas and Missouri had one of the most intense rivalries in college football. Known as the Border War, the roots of the rivalry dated to the years before the American Civil War.|$|E
