5|$|As {{a result}} of his many {{interactions}} with U.S. officials and settlers, Irataba was invited to Washington, D.C., in 1864, for an official meeting with members of the U.S. military and its government, including President Abraham Lincoln. In doing so, he became the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. He received considerable attention during his tours of the U.S. capital, and of New York City and Philadelphia, where he was given gifts, including a silver-headed cane from Lincoln. Upon his return he negotiated the creation of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, which caused a split in the Mohave Nation when he led several hundred of his supporters to the Colorado River valley. The majority of the Mohave preferred to remain in their ancestral homelands near Fort Mohave and under the leadership of their hereditary leader, Homoseh quahote, who was less enthusiastic about direct collaboration <b>with</b> <b>whites.</b> As leader of the Colorado River band of Mohave, Irataba encouraged peaceful relations <b>with</b> <b>whites,</b> served as a mediator between the warring tribes in the area, and during his later years continued to lead the Mohave in their ongoing conflicts with the Paiute and Chemehuevi.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after the claim by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After gold was discovered in California in 1849, more White emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than ever had before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact <b>with</b> <b>Whites.</b>|$|E
5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E

5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact <b>with</b> <b>whites,</b> the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence {{has been found to}} suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} {{the revival of the}} Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents <b>with</b> <b>Whites</b> in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E

5|$|Such {{restrictions}} dated back {{to colonial}} times, and were {{found throughout the}} United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North {{and later in the}} South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from New Orleans to resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in public accommodations and public transportation.|$|E
5|$|The passage {{beginning}} at bars 231 ("NUN: Scrutemur vias nostras") presents a rhythmic texture new to Stravinsky, which strongly resembles the multilayered rhythms of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße, which Robert Craft was rehearsing in Stravinsky's home {{at precisely the}} time of composition (16 January to 14 February 1958). Stravinsky attended not only these rehearsals but also the recording sessions for Zeitmaße, following the score with great interest. The published score of Threni is also the first of Stravinsky's works to adopt the notational device of replacing the staves in silent measures <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> space on the page, a feature frequently found in Stravinsky's manuscripts as early as 1916, but only in print from this point onward. This feature {{is also found in}} Stockhausen's score.|$|E

25|$|The Seminoles gave {{up their}} lands in the panhandle and slowly settled into the reservation, {{although}} they had isolated clashes <b>with</b> <b>whites.</b> Colonel (later General) Duncan Lamont Clinch was placed {{in charge of the}} Army units in Florida.

25|$|As in {{southern}} states, {{the end of}} the Civil War brought freedom to enslaved African Americans held by Cherokee. By an 1866 treaty with the US government, the Cherokee agreed to grant tribal citizenship to freedmen who had been held by them as slaves. Both before and after the Civil War, some Cherokee intermarried or had relationships with African Americans, just as they had <b>with</b> <b>whites.</b> Many Cherokee Freedmen were active politically within the tribe.|$|E
25|$|By 1808, {{tensions}} <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> and the Wapakoneta Shawnees compelled Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh {{to retreat}} further northwest and establish {{the village of}} Prophetstown near {{the confluence of the}} Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers, land claimed by the Miami. Little Turtle told the Shawnee that they were unwelcome there, but the warnings were ignored. Tenskwatawa's religious teachings became more widely known as they became more militant, and he attracted Native American followers from many different nations, including Shawnee, Iroquois, Chickamauga, Meskwaki, Miami, Mingo, Ojibwe, Ottawa, Kickapoo, Delaware (Lenape), Mascouten, Potawatomi, Sauk, and Wyandot.|$|E
25|$|Given its {{southern}} Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters {{broke out in}} repeated violence, <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> attacking blacks in 1829. Anti-abolitionists attacked blacks in the city {{in a wave of}} destruction that resulted in 1,200 blacks leaving the city and the country; they resettled in Canada. The riot and its refugees were topics of discussion throughout the country, and blacks organized the first Negro Convention in 1830 in Philadelphia to discuss these events.|$|E

25|$|Peace {{had come}} to Florida for a while. The Indians were mostly staying on the reservation, but there were minor clashes. The Florida {{authorities}} continued to press for removal of all Indians from Florida. The Indians for their part tried to limit their contacts <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> as much as possible. As time went on there were more serious incidents. The government resolved once more to remove all Indians from Florida, and applied increasing pressure on the Seminoles until they struck back, starting the Third Seminole War of 1855-1858.|$|E
25|$|Thousands {{of slaves}} with {{families}} fled from rural plantations to Union lines, and the Army established a contraband camp {{south of the}} city lines. By 1865 there were 20,000 blacks in the city, a sevenfold increase from the 3,000 before the war. The presence of black Union soldiers was resented by ethnic whites in the city; thousands of Irish had immigrated since the mid-19th century. In 1866 there was a major massacre <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> attacking blacks. Forty-five blacks were reported killed, and nearly twice as many wounded; much of their makeshift housing was destroyed. By 1870, the black population was 15,000 in a city total of 40,226.|$|E
25|$|After Reconstruction through 1900, St. Louis {{saw little}} of the racial {{violence}} that engulfed Southern states, due to the stability and relatively small size of the St. Louis black community. Most black residents lived in the northern edges of downtown along the riverfront or {{in the area of}} Chestnut Valley and Mill Creek Valley, near the wharf and railroads for employment. Municipal segregation laws (known as Jim Crow laws) were relatively inconsistent; while blacks could not enter white hotels, restaurants or barber shops, they could enter department store elevators <b>with</b> <b>whites</b> or attend St. Louis theater shows in separate sections. Streetcar seating also was integrated, and there were no efforts to enforce residential segregation prior to 1911.|$|E
