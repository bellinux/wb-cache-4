5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids.

5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians.

5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt {{in a position to}} offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E
5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she was too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E

5|$|In 1881, Nielsen {{began to}} take his violin playing more seriously, {{studying}} privately under Carl Larsen, the sexton at Odense Cathedral. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, {{and that he had}} difficulty in coming to terms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to Niels W. Gade, the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice, and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.|$|E
5|$|In 6BC, on {{the verge}} of {{accepting}} command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes. The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear.

Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{has become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E
