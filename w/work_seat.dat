50|$|Rope {{access is}} a form of work positioning, {{initially}} developed from techniques used in climbing and caving, which applies practical ropework to allow workers to access difficult-to-reach locations without the use of scaffolding, cradles or an aerial work platform. Rope access technicians descend, ascend, and traverse ropes for access and work while suspended by their harness. Sometimes a <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> may be used. The support of the rope is intended to eliminate the likelihood of a fall altogether, but a back-up fall arrest system is used in case of the unlikely failure of the primary means of support. This redundancy system is usually achieved by using two ropes - a working line and a safety line.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of research is}} to find out and to study the effect of <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> improvement on the musculoskeletal complaints in sewing task in “X” Village of Juwiring Subdistrict of Klaten Regency. The research method employed in this study was a Quasi Experiment with one group pre-test and post-test design. The sampling technique used was random sampling. Random sampling means the selection of a group of subject through restriction obtained with inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this research, the population number was 31 male workers. The subject was done using random sampling with restriction so that 15 workers qualifying the inclusion and exclusion were obtained as the sample. The data collection was done using Anthropometry measurement, the <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> measurement before reparation, the administration of ergonomic seat according to the worker’s anthropometry and the use of Nordic body map questionnaire to find out the musculoskeletal complaints. Technique of processing and analyzing data used was nonparametric statistic test-wilcoxon test using SPSS version 16. 0 computer software. The result of analysis on the difference of musculoskeletal complaints before and after the treatment using wilcoxon test shows p value of 0. 001 (P Value 0. 001 < 0. 01) means very significant that there is a value difference before and after the <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> improvement. After the <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> reparation the average (X) ± SD total score of musculoskeletal complaints decreases from 65. 1 ± 3. 1 to 41. 3 ± 3. 8.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> for industrial sewing operations was {{compared with a}} traditional sewing <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of design features. The new seat was designed with special seat-pan and backrest features to accommodate the musculoskeletal geometry of a low sit-stand posture. The seat-pan consisted of a pelvic support which supported the ischial tuberosities and areas behind them, and a thigh support which maintained the theghs at a 15 [deg] downward angle, resulting in a 105 [deg] trunk-thigh angle. The backrest consisted of a lumbar support which preserved lumbar lordosis and a thoracic support which supported the upper back during backward leaning. The traditional <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> was similar to an office chair (i e, a large horizontal seat-pan and a wide backrest) with the exception of having a higher than normal seat-height. This investigation consisted of three studies to compare the seats: (1) A user comfort and acceptance experiment which compared the initial psychophysical responses of 50 industrial sewers when introduced to the new seat; (2) a backrest usage experiment which compared the duration of backrest use among 10 industrial sewers; and (3) a follow-up experiment to evaluate chair preference after extended use of the new seat. The results of the user comfort and acceptance experiment found that the new <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> had greater comfort and user preference; the results of the backrest usage experiment found that the new seat had greater backrest use than the traditional seat; the results of the follow-up experiment found that the preference for the new seat was maintained over time and not due to a Hawthorne Effect...|$|E

40|$|According to Evans et al. (1992) whether school {{furniture}} {{is responsible for}} students sitting discomfort, and whether discomfort) (can be related to a mismatch between individual anthropometry and school chair and desk dimensions has not been shown. Despite this, Grimes and Legg (2004) stated that: a) a mismatch between thigh length and seat depth has been significantly related to general sitting discomfort, b) a mismatch in seated elbow height and desk height has been significantly related to reported neck and shoulder pain. The body dimensions of the user population are of primary importance {{for the design of}} workstations (Helander et aI., 1987) to develop healthy and comfortable posture. Nissinen et al. (1994) stated that anthropometric measurements have also been taken as a predictor of low back pain, although their role seems modest. According to Balague et al. (1993), anthropometric parameter is one of the factors associated with low back pain. Hence in deriving chair design dimensions and in developing comfortable sitting posture, anthropmetric parameters are important Eewer attentions have been paid for designing ergonomically- correct chairs for university students. Thariq and Munasinghe (2005) found that the present day Sri Lankan university lecture room chairs do not fit the body dimension of the students. On the other hand, the availability of anthropometric characteristics of Sri Lankan related to chair design is very limited. A national anthropometric survey on workers population was carried out by Abeysekara (1985). He recommended design dimensions for <b>work</b> <b>seat.</b> But those dimensions are not used by furniture designers or manufacturers to design <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> as they are not aware of the availability of this data. The recommendations made by Abeysekara (1985) for <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> design are based on the anthropometric data of specified worker population.

40|$|Little {{information}} {{is available in the}} literature concerning an ergonomic systems view of industrial seats. This study has been aimed at expanding knowledge of industrial seat design. For this purpose, a model for evaluating industrial seats has been proposed, listing demands and restrictions from the task and the workplace. It also includes responses and effects on the sitter, and methods of measurement for evaluating industrial work seats. The appropriateness of <b>work</b> <b>seat</b> design has been assessed in laboratory and field studies, using methods to measure body loads, their effects and responses. These have been body height shrinkage, biomechanical methods, subjective assessment, and posture assessment. The shrinkage method, including equipment and procedures, has been developed in this project. It assesses the effect of loads on the spine in vivo by using body height changes as a measure of disc creep. The results are well correlated with spinal loads. The method is sensitive enough to differentiate between spinal loads of 100 N difference. The results are also related to the perception of discomfort. Biomechanical methods have been developed for calculating compressive, shear, and momental loads on the spine. Ratings of discomfort, body mapping, interviews, video recordings, and prototype equipment for the recording of head posture have also been used. The methods {{have been shown to be}} appropriate for seat evaluation. Work seats have been evaluated in different tasks, incorporating back-rests of different height, width and shape, conventional seat pans and sit-stand seats. It has been shown that advantageous chair features could be referred to each particular task. The tasks evaluated included forward force exertion (high backrests advantageous), vision to the side (low backrests advantageous), work with restricted knee-room (seats allowing increased trunk-thigh angle advantageous), grinding (high, narrow backrests advantageous), punch press work (increased seat height advantageous), and fork lift truck driving (medium height backrest advantageous). The work task has been shown to be a major influence on seat design, and must therefore always be thoroughly considered...|$|E

50|$|Some {{characteristics}} of having good teacher-student {{relationships in the}} classroom involves the appropriate levels of dominance, cooperation, and awareness of high-needs students. Dominance {{is defined as the}} teacher’s ability to give clear purpose and guidance concerning student behavior and their academics. By creating and giving clear expectations and consequences for student behavior, this builds effective relationships. Such expectations may cover classroom etiquette and behavior, group <b>work,</b> <b>seating</b> arrangements, the use of equipment and materials, and also classroom disruptions. Assertive teacher behavior also reassures that thoughts and messages are being passed on to the student in an effective way. Assertive behavior can be achieved by using erect posture, appropriate tone of voice depending on the current situation, and taking care not to ignore inappropriate behavior by taking action.|$|R
