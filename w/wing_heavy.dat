During this period, Aguadilla was home to the Strategic Air Command 72d Bombardment <b>Wing,</b> <b>Heavy</b> {{equipped}} with B-52s, a very strategic facility during the Cold War. During {{the early years of the}} base and throughout World War II, Puerto Ricans in the area became more Americanized than in remote locations, and the after effects are still apparent in Aguadilla, and other towns like Aguada, Moca and Isabela.|$|E

(272 kg) to {{the weight of the}} Baby, but the P.V.1 was still able to reach a height of 8,000 ft. (2,438 m) and achieve a speed of 67 kt (77 mph, 124 km/h).|$|R

2500|$|The 62nd Troop Carrier <b>Wing</b> (<b>Heavy)</b> was {{reassigned to}} the Military Air Transport Service Continental Division on 1 July 1957 as TAC realigned its {{transport}} units.

2500|$|Albatros {{responded with}} the D.Va, which {{featured}} stronger <b>wing</b> spars, <b>heavier</b> <b>wing</b> ribs and a reinforced fuselage. The modified D.Va was [...] {{heavier than the}} D.III but the structural problems were not entirely cured. Use of the high-compression 130kW (180hp) Mercedes D.IIIaü engine offset the increased weight of the D.Va. The D.Va also reverted to the D.III aileron cable linkage, running outwards through the lower wing, then upwards to the ailerons {{to provide a more}} positive control response. The wings of the D.III and D.Va were interchangeable. To further strengthen the wing, the D.Va added a small diagonal brace connecting the forward interplane strut to {{the leading edge of the}} lower wing; the brace was also retrofitted to some D.Vs.|$|R
2500|$|The 39th Bombardment <b>Wing,</b> <b>Heavy,</b> was {{activated}} on 15 November 1962 at Eglin AFB as a Strategic Air Command B-52G Stratofortress bombardment wing.

[...] The 39th BW was a redesignation of the former 4135th Strategic Wing which was inactivated on 1 February 1963 and the unit redesignated in order to retain the lineage of the combat units and to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive units with illustrious World War II records. [...] The wing's 62d Bomb Squadron flew B-52G's which it acquired from the 301st Bomb Squadron.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, [...] of land {{adjacent}} to the Mad River at the northeast boundary of the base, near the former location of the village of Osborn, were purchased for a Strategic Air Command dispersal site. Area D structures were demolished in 1957 (donated to the state in 1963 for Wright State University). In February 1958 the Wright Field (Area B) runways were closed to all jet traffic (1959 Area C operations included 139,276 takeoffs and landings, Area B had 44,699.) The West Ramp complex was built between August 1958 and July 1960. The 4043rd Strategic Wing began KC-135 Stratotanker operations in February 1960 and B-52 Stratofortress operations in June 1960. On 1 July 1963, the wing was re-designated the 17th Bombardment <b>Wing</b> (<b>Heavy)</b> and continued its mission under this unit until 7 July 1975, when the last of its 11 B-52s was transferred to Beale Air Force Base, California. From 1957-1962, WADC's Hurricane Supersonic Research Site in Utah was a detached installation of Wright-Patt.|$|E
