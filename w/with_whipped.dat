2500|$|The {{invention}} of crème Chantilly is often credited incorrectly, and without evidence, to François Vatel, maître d'hôtel at the Château de Chantilly in the mid-17th century.

2500|$|Brussels waffles are {{prepared}} with an egg-white-leavened or yeast-leavened batter, traditionally an ale yeast; occasionally {{both types of}} leavening are used together. They are lighter, crisper and have larger pockets compared to other European waffle varieties, and are easy to differentiate from Liège Waffles by their rectangular sides. In Belgium, most waffles are served warm by street vendors and dusted with confectioner's sugar, though in tourist areas they might be topped <b>with</b> <b>whipped</b> cream, soft fruit or chocolate spread. Variants of the Brussels waffles – <b>with</b> <b>whipped</b> and folded egg whites cooked in large rectangular forms – date from the 18th century. However, the oldest recognized reference to [...] "Gaufres de Bruxelles" [...] (Brussels Waffles) by name is attributed from 1842/43 to Florian Dacher, a Swiss baker in Ghent, Belgium, who had previously worked under pastry chefs in central Brussels. Philippe Cauderlier would later publish Dacher's recipe in the 1874 edition of his recipe book [...] "La Pâtisserie et la Confiture". Maximilien Consael, another Ghent chef, had claimed to have invented the waffles in 1839, though there's no written record of him either naming or selling the waffles until his participation in the 1856 Brussels Fair. It {{should be noted that}} neither man created the recipe; they simply popularized and formalized an existing recipe as the Brussels waffle.|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, 2002, the Ohio Supreme Court {{rejected}} a claim by Coleman's attorneys that the state's plan {{to accommodate the}} large number of victims and survivors who wanted to view the execution would turn it into a [...] "spectator sport". So many victims and survivors of Coleman's crimes were allowed to witness the execution that prison officials had to set up a closed-circuit viewing venue outside of the building. For his last meal, Coleman ordered a well-done filet mignon smothered with mushrooms, fried chicken breasts, a salad with French dressing, sweet potato pie topped <b>with</b> <b>whipped</b> cream, French fries, collard greens, onion rings, cornbread, broccoli with melted cheese, biscuits and gravy, and Cherry Coke. On April 26, 2002, reciting Psalm 23, Alton Coleman was executed by lethal injection in the death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio. Reginald Wilkinson, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, said Coleman had not directly expressed remorse for the killings, but that he had [...] "admitted what he's done in his own convoluted way." ...|$|E
