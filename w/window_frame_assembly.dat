40|$|<b>Window</b> <b>frame</b> {{material}} has {{significant impact on}} the thermal performance of the window. Moreover, with sustainable design becoming a necessity, <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> materials need to have higher levels of environmental performance to be considered sustainable. As a result, a holistic performance metric is needed to assess <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> material. Three similar frames were considered, manufactured from aluminum, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and wood. First their thermal performance was evaluated and compared using a heat transfer model. Then, carbon footprints of the three materials were considered for 1 m 2 of window area with a similar thermal performance. It was found that the thermal, as well as the environmental, performance of the wooden <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> was superior to those of aluminum and PVC. On the other hand aluminum frames had high environmental impacts and comparatively lower thermal performance. This study provides a holistic viewpoint on <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> by considering both environmental and thermal performance...|$|R

40|$|Study of <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> {{fabrication}} by {{injection moulding}} process {{was carried out}} {{with the aid of}} MoldflowÂ® software. Rice husk filled high-density polyethylene was used as the raw material. Solid and hollow designs (A 001 and A 002) were created to compare {{the pros and cons of}} each design. The investigations were carried out on flowing, packing, cooling and costing of injection moulded <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> At the end of the analysis, the most feasible design was selected to be further undergone stress analysis according to BS EN 14608 : 2004 and BS EN 14609 : 2004. Eventually, the mechanical properties were classified according to BS EN 13115 : 2001. The actual processing conditions of rice husk composite were approximated to softwood at Cross-WLF viscosity model due to unavailability of rice husk plastic composite (RHPC) rheology property. RHPC melt is generally shear thinning, meanings that the viscosity decreases with increasing of shear rates. From the analysis, <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> with hollow design is preferable, since hollow design has advantage of filling, packing, and cooling properties. The hollow design also costs less than solid design of <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> However, high injection pressure and clamping tonnage are unfavourable for hollow design. A 002 hollow design was selected as the most feasible <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> to be fabricated. Stress analysis was done to classify the <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> The analyses were carried out to determine racking and static torsion resistance. A 002 <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> mechanical strength is classified as Class 2 according to BS EN 13115 : 2001...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} findings of a market and research review related to state-of-the-art highly insulating <b>window</b> <b>frames.</b> The market review focuses on <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> that satisfy the Passivhaus requirements (window U-value less or equal to 0. 8 W/m{sup 2 }K), while other examples are also given in order to show the variety of materials and solutions that may be used for constructing <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> with a low thermal transmittance (U-value). The market search shows that several combinations of materials are used in order to obtain <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> with a low U-value. The most common insulating material seems to be Polyurethane (PUR), which is used together with most of the common structural materials such as wood, aluminum, and PVC. The frame research review also shows examples of <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> developed in order to increase the energy efficiency of the frames and the glazings which the frames are to be used together with. The authors find that two main tracks are used in searching for better solutions. The first one is to minimize the heat losses through the frame itself. The result is that conductive materials are replaced by highly thermal insulating materials and air cavities. The other option is to reduce the <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> area to a minimum, which is done by focusing on the net energy gain by the entire <b>window</b> (<b>frame,</b> spacer and glazing). Literature shows that a window with a higher U-value may give a net energy gain to a building that is higher than a window with a smaller U-value. The net energy gain is calculated by subtracting the transmission losses through the window from the solar energy passing through the windows. The net energy gain depends on frame versus glazing area, solar factor, solar irradiance, calculation period and U-value. The frame research review also discusses heat transfer modeling issues related to <b>window</b> <b>frames.</b> Thermal performance increasing measures, surface modeling, and frame cavity modeling are among the topics discussed. The review shows that the current knowledge gives the basis for improving the calculation procedures in the calculation standards. At the same time it is room for improvement within some areas, e. g. to fully understand the natural convection effects inside irregular vertical frame cavities (jambs) and ventilated frame cavities...|$|R
