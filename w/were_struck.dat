5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|Assay Commission medals <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> from {{a variety}} of metals, {{including}} copper, silver, bronze, and pewter. The first Assay Commission medals <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in 1860 at the direction of Mint Director James Ross Snowden. The initial purpose in having medals struck was not principally to provide keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's medal-striking capabilities. The nascent custom lapsed when Snowden left office in 1861.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters <b>were</b> <b>struck,</b> {{but this was}} most likely in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By {{the end of the}} day, all three denominations had been coined.|$|E
50|$|The {{commemorative}} coins {{issued by}} the Bank of Israel <b>are</b> <b>struck</b> in gold and silver. The 1 New Shekel and 2 New Shekel Coins <b>are</b> <b>struck</b> in silver, while the 5, 10 and 20 New Shekels (and small size 1 New Shekel) <b>are</b> <b>struck</b> in gold.|$|R
50|$|In 1318 AH (1900), {{a copper}} larin (or laari) <b>was</b> <b>struck.</b> In 1319 AH (1901), a copper Larin <b>was</b> also <b>struck.</b> In 1320 AH (1902), a copper Larin & a 4 laari <b>was</b> <b>struck.</b>|$|R

5|$|No {{further action}} was taken until the summer of 1834, when {{officials}} suggested that proof coin sets be prepared as gifts for Asian dignitaries. After examining Mint records, personnel incorrectly concluded that the last Draped Bust dollars minted were dated 1804, so they chose that date for the coins. It is unknown why the current date was not used, but numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests the coins were predated to prevent coin collectors from becoming angered when they {{would be unable to}} obtain the newly dated coins, which <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in very small numbers. It is unknown precisely how many 1804 dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck,</b> though eight are known to be extant.|$|E
5|$|Some Peace dollars using a {{base metal}} {{composition}} <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> as experimental pieces in 1970 {{in anticipation of}} the approval of the Eisenhower dollar; they are all presumed destroyed. This new dollar coin was approved by an act signed by President Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970, with the obverse to depict President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died in March, 1969. Circulating Eisenhower dollars contained no precious metal, though some for collectors <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in 40%silver.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 162,099 Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> at the Philadelphia Mint in April and May, 1925, with 99 pieces {{set aside for}} {{inspection}} and testing by the 1926 Assay Commission. The coins were made from blanks, or planchets, that had been intended for mintage into 1924 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars, but had not been used.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people believe}} that, for various reasons, large cities cannot <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> by tornadoes. More than 100tornadoes have been {{reported}} to strike downtown areas of large cities. Many cities have <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> twice or more, and a fewincluding Lubbock, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; Topeka, Kansas; and London, Englandhave <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> by violent tornadoes (F4 or stronger).|$|R

5000|$|The chengila is a {{percussion}} {{instrument that}} maintains a steady beat and provides musical background. The thick bell metal disc, which hangs by a strap looped around one wrist, <b>is</b> <b>struck</b> {{by a short}} wand held in the other hand. A ringing sound is produced when the chengila <b>is</b> <b>struck</b> when hanging freely; a flat tone is produced when it <b>is</b> <b>struck</b> while held against the forearm.|$|R
5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} is proof that none <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|E
5|$|All Assay Commission medals are {{extremely}} rare. Except for the 1977 medal, none {{is believed to}} have been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in most years fewer than 50 <b>were</b> <b>struck.</b> Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E
5|$|As the Eisenhower dollar awaited its demise, {{approximately}} 50 {{million per}} year <b>were</b> <b>struck,</b> using the eagle design for the reverse. In both years, the majority coined were at Denver. No silver collector's edition was issued; the blue and brown Ikes ended with 1974.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} issues of these pieces. The first issue <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> in 1966 {{and the second}} issue <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> in 1974. The obverse of these medal-coins depict the {{portrait}} of President-Archbishop Makarios III.|$|R
50|$|On August 19, 1997 Todd Greene {{accomplished}} a rare feat by {{being one of}} the only position players in history to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> out by a position player. He <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> out by Wade Boggs.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 {{a silver}} coin <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> for {{distribution}} to monks. Although this coin {{was the last}} tangka issue, it was valued at 5 srang and was the last silver coin to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> in Tibet.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1834, threepence (3d) pieces <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> for {{circulation}}, {{bearing the}} same design as the Maundy 3d. The circulation pieces were initially struck {{for use in}} the West Indies, but beginning in 1845, were coined for use in Britain as well. Many of the 3d pieces presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were spent, and these are rarer than the other values today. Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy pieces. The design of the circulation 3d remained {{the same as that of}} the Maundy 3d until 1928, when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins. Twopence coins identical to Maundy pieces, intended for colonial use, <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in 1838, 1843, and 1848.|$|E
5|$|British {{submarines}} {{were becoming}} increasingly {{active in the}} Baltic by late 1915; several cruisers had been sunk and the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships {{could no longer be}} risked there. Therefore, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service and disarmed by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. The entire class, with the exception of Zähringen, <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> from the navy list after the end of World War I. Mecklenburg was struck on 27 January 1920, Wettin followed on 11 March 1920, and Wittelsbach and Schwaben <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> on 8 March 1921. The four ships were broken up between 1921–22. Zähringen was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1926–27. Royal Air Force bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E
50|$|On 15 April 1976, she <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> {{from the}} US Naval Vessel Register. She <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> from the China Naval Register on August 1988 and {{returned}} to US custody. She was ultimately sunk as a target.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, {{the first}} year of Barbados having its own coinage, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, and $1. From 1973 through 1991, the 1¢ <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> in bronze. From 1992, copper-plated zinc has been used. The 5¢ coin <b>is</b> <b>struck</b> in brass, whilst the highest 3 denominations <b>are</b> <b>struck</b> in cupronickel. The $1 coin is a 7-sided equilaterally-curved piece. A flying fish is adorned on one side, with the Barbadian coat of arms on the reverse. The Barbadian dollar coins are now minted in a plated-steel planchet first issued in 2007. Many of the coins in circulation have <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> at the Royal Canadian Mint.|$|R
50|$|The coins <b>were</b> hand <b>struck,</b> {{and exhibit}} {{a number of}} errors such as mis-striking and double-striking. There are also {{examples}} where the coin has <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> using mismatched obverse and reverse dies, or where two blanks have <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> together, resulting in one coin with a blank reverse and a matching coin with a blank obverse.|$|R
5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, two Royal Knights and six Stranger Knights, all monarchs or princes {{of enemy}} nations and {{including}} Wilhelm II, German Emperor and Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> off {{the roll of}} the Order or had their appointments annulled in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Half dimes {{continued}} to be struck, at both the Philadelphia and the San Francisco Mint, until the series was ended by the Coinage Act of 1873. Despite the abolition, the silver pieces {{continued to}} circulate in the West, where silver or gold coins were preferred, throughout {{the remainder of the}} 19th century. Improved economic conditions, combined with low silver prices, brought large quantities of hoarded silver coinage, including half dimes, into circulation beginning in April 1876. In late 1876, production of the Shield nickel was halted. No Shield nickels <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in 1877 or 1878, excepting proof specimens for collectors. As the Treasury had a large stock of nickels in storage, only small numbers <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> over the next few years; full-scale production did not resume until December 1881.|$|E
50|$|Ki and tsuke {{covers the}} {{distinctive}} sounds made by striking two square oak boards. When the two boards <b>are</b> <b>struck</b> together, they produce the ki sound. When they <b>are</b> <b>struck</b> against a hardwood board, they produce the tsuke sound.|$|R
50|$|The Pysa was a Zanzibari coin that <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> in AH1299 (1882) and AH1304 (1887). The obverses {{of these}} coins have {{a pair of}} scales. The name 'Pysa' {{is derived from the}} {{currency}} units 'Pice' and 'Paisa'. The AH1299 1 Pysa often turns up in old coin collections, but the AH1304 coin very seldom turns up. The AH1299 coin <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> at the Royal Belgian Mint, Brussels, Belgium while the AH1304 coin <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> at Heaton's Mint, Birmingham, England.|$|R

5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design to add the {{initials}} of the designer (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008 {{large areas}} of Zimbabwe <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> by the ongoing cholera epidemic. By December 2008 more than 10,000 people had been {{infected}} {{in all but one}} of Zimbabwe's provinces and the outbreak had spread to Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia. On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid.|$|E
5|$|In January 1938, the Mint {{announced}} an open competition {{for a new}} nickel design, to feature early president Thomas Jefferson on the obverse, and Jefferson's home, Monticello on the reverse. The last Buffalo nickels <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in April 1938 at the Denver Mint, the only mint to strike them that year.|$|E
