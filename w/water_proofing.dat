5000|$|Realizing that plastic, like asphalt, was a {{petroleum}} product, Bergman {{theorized that}} plastic could be recycled {{and used to}} build highways. She brought the idea to her former partner Gary Fishback, who patented it under the Plasphalt™. [...] Plasphalt consists of recycled plastic that is made into a heat absorbing material and is added to asphalt to displace petroleum and hydrocarbon pollutants. While at the time 10% more expensive to use than traditional asphalt, Plasphalt lasts 25% longer. In 2002, Plasphalt was used to reinforce a 2-mile stretch of New Mexico's I-25. Fishback and Erik Bowers (Bergman's son) of TEWA Technology developed the project and materials, diverting 27% of all waste from landfill to the highway. At the time TEWA's best local suppliers were Philips Semiconductors, Intel, Coca-Cola, and Sandia National Laboratories. [...] Unfortunately, {{because of lack of}} support from local government, the company went bankrupt. However, Plasphalt is now used to build roads in China and India. The benefits of using plastic in asphalt according to Valenti,Michael author of Plastic Plus Asphalt equals [...] "Plasphalt",is that the impermeability of the plastic improved the <b>water</b> <b>proofing</b> of the plasphalt, making it more resistant to rain, snow, or ice. A benefit of the plasphalt process is that it works well mixed plastics, such as high density polyetylene and polytetrafluorethylene. It also does not require the laborious sorting of different types of plastics, as do other recycling techniques. Laying a single mile of road would require 100 to 200 tons of plasphalt according to Dennis Egan, a mechanical engineer with Plasphalt Project Ltd.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPoor and {{improper}} building maintenance {{will definitely}} cause more damages and costly repair works if left unattended. In Malaysia, buildings are built {{in accordance with}} British Standard and under strict supervision. Unfortunately the maintenance aspects of the building are still weak. Making it worse, sometimes building maintenance is perceived as merely about the mechanical and electrical system in the buildings without much consideration given to civil and structural elements. This non-research paper is to discuss the common maintenance problems and building defects on civil and structural elements at the Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) buildings across Malaysia due to various factors. Some common problems involving <b>water</b> <b>proofing</b> system, cracks, soil settlement are discussed in this paper. For instance, with tropical climate and average rainfall of 250 centimetres in a year, a good <b>water</b> <b>proofing</b> system is crucial for buildings with flat roof in Malaysia. However the performance of <b>water</b> <b>proofing</b> systems depend on many factors i. e. quality of the materials, the skill of workers, application methods, substrates condition, weather, maintenance, etc. Recent roof leakage incidents at numerous prestigious buildings such as parliament house, high court and other government buildings has sparked more awareness among the engineering fraternity {{on the importance of}} good and systematic building maintenance. With 34 office buildings throughout Malaysia, Property Division of SOCSO has been dealing with such problems regularly and would like to share them with other participants of this conference...|$|E

30|$|A fabric’s {{transport}} {{properties are}} {{closely associated with}} its comfort performance and can be reflected {{by a combination of}} air permeability, thermal resistance and moisture vapour evaporation, which are also governed by structural factors (chemical and physical) (Slater [1977]; Sun et al. [2000], Yoo et al. [2000]; Yoo and Barker [2005]). Heat, air and moisture transport through FFPPC is a complex process, which is coupled with evaporation, condensation and sorption and desorption of moisture (Holmer [2006]). Air permeability allows the air to pass through the fabric, which assist heat loss from the FFPPC. Adequate ventilation can reduce the insulation properties of clothing as well by 5 to 50 % (Saville [1999]), which may reduce the protective performance of FFPPC. The other problem associated with air permeable fabric is that it may allow the passage of water into the structure, which necessities <b>water</b> <b>proofing.</b> The materials designed to facilitate metabolic heat loss do not necessarily correspond to those required for thermal insulation and <b>water</b> <b>proofing.</b> Hence, these requirements can lead to a comfort/protection paradox.|$|E
