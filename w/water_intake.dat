The development involves mainly a brainstorming session to finalize the conceptual design, and computer modeling. Commercial computational fluid dynamic program was utilized to create computer model to analyse and evaluate the river flow characteristics due to trash diverter installation {{in order to determine}} the trash diverter location for effective diversion of trashes and minimum flow resistance into the <b>water</b> <b>intakes.</b> Finite element analysis program was used to do stress analysis on the trash diverter structure. The power station requirement, the design of existing <b>water</b> <b>intakes</b> from other local hydropower and water treatment plants were also considered in finding the effective solution.
