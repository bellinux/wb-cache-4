5|$|Most of Jennings {{second term}} was spent {{grappling}} with the state's continuing financial difficulties. When tax revenues and land sales remained low, the state's revenue <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to repay the bonds it used to finance internal improvements. The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly depreciate {{the value of its}} bonds, harming the state's credit and making it difficult to secure new loans.|$|E

The large proportion of men in prisoner of war camps changed the gender balance in jobs. Many women took over running family farms and businesses, and others were forced to look for employment.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is {{considered}} one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net. The victory <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to secure a place in the second round, and Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to determine ULs.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene.|$|E

5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, {{although it did}} not begin operations until the following year. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to constitute insider trading.|$|E

The German Kriegsmarine decided to repair the battleship, and works were completed by mid-July. The British conducted further carrier raids against Tirpitz between April and August 1944 {{in the hope of}} prolonging the period she was out of service, but none was successful. Tirpitz was eventually disabled and then sunk by Royal Air Force heavy bombers in late 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was {{a crackdown on}} reform. The government instructed the police and courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o {{with a long}} throw-in {{down the}} right wing. The Cameroonian then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved {{the top of the}} crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, {{culminating}} with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, taking out the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a Gullfisk {{lost control}} {{on the line and}} derailed near Sjømansskolen, causing the tram to be scrapped. From 1977, Oslo Sporveier also put SM53 trams into service. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient,</b> and Oslo Sporveier {{considered}} introducing the old Ekeberg Line trams. But this would be costly, as the vehicles would have to be upgraded. Instead, used MBG trams from the Gothenburg Tramway were put into service. The section from Sæter to Ljabru had since the opening had a signaling system that had worked fine with 15- and 20-minute headways, but did not work properly with 10-minute routes. A new system was installed, and proved to work just as poorly as the old system. During 1979, the section was rebuilt to double track, although the short bridge over Nordstrandsveien was kept single tracked.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the British Army had seen two major {{operations}} in close succession - the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny - and it had become apparent that the existing organisation of the forces <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> for large-scale modern warfare. The first wave of reforms was from 1858 to 1860. This period saw the creation of the Staff College, which helped to turn officers in {{the upper reaches of the}} Army into professional soldiers; the transformation of the old East India Company army into the Indian Army to better control the forces in India; and the creation of the Volunteer Force to help with home defence whilst the Regular Army was overseas.|$|E
5|$|She and Charles had six {{children}} together. Before {{her first child}} Charles's birth, Lucinda had a premonition that her son would not live very long. She told her mother that the dress she sewed for him was like a funeral shroud, and after baby Charles's death at age two, she buried him in it. Lucinda's second child, a daughter named Rosette, also died in infancy. Dalton often references these lost child infants in her poetry. Her third child, Clifford, was born on February 18, 1875. Charles was a joint owner of a store in Beaver and also hauled freight to surrounding areas. However, his income <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to support his four wives and many children.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{started an}} {{evaluation}} of the Ringerike Line, carried out by the National Rail Administration, in 2006. The first edition was completed in 2009, but was found to be insufficient, resulting in the process being restarted. A new report was published in June 2011. In September 2012, the ministry concluded that also the second report was insufficient {{and that it would be}} discarded. There were two main concerns with the report. Firstly, it was based on a single-track line which would not be built to the standards of high-speed rail. The ministry stated that all new railway plans in Norway were to have double track and be optimized for high-speed rail. Secondly, the report had a simplified economic analysis which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to be used for political evaluation. The result of the discard was that the planning of E16 was no longer tied to the planning of the railway.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish threat continued; raiding parties {{destroyed}} the Killigrews' family home at Arwenack in 1593, and four Spanish ships attacked the towns {{along the coast}} in 1595. In 1597 a Spanish fleet with 20,000 men set out to assault Pendennis and invade England, only being prevented from landing by bad weather. The failed attack caused considerable concern inside government and the Privy Council were informed that the castle <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to prevent a Spanish landing along the coast. A subsequent review carried out by Sir Nicholas Parker, Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Ferdinando Gorges recommended that the castle's defences should be significantly extended. The military engineer Paul Ive constructed an Italian-styled ring of earthworks, embrasures, bastions and a stone-revetted ditch around the original Henrician castle between 1597 and 1600, using a team of 400 local workers, costing around £80 a week in wages.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For manganese there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> {{information to}} set EARs and RDAs, so needs {{are described as}} estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) Manganese deficiency is rare.|$|E
