5|$|Margaery Tyrell {{is brought}} to meet the High Sparrow, who warns her {{to stay away from}} her life of riches and sin, and recounts his past of how, as a proud cobbler, he learned his wealth-guided pursuits were lies and that the shoeless poor were closer to the truth than anyone. He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is {{breaking}} under the Sparrows' torture, and is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to make it stop. Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, {{within the context of the}} Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E
5|$|As Rana Bahadur Shah's {{bodyguard}} and advisor, Bhimsen Thapa also {{accompanied him}} to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu {{to serve as}} the regent. Since Rana Bahadur was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissidenting factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the terai. However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power. The Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters {{in the name of the}} ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{way that}} Algeria (which the French {{considered}} {{an integral part of}} France) had become engulfed in a spiral of increasing savage violence that French leaders longed to put an end to, the Mollet administration had felt tempted by Molotov's offer, but in the end, Mollet, a firm Atlanticist, had chosen to remain faithful to NATO. In Mollet's view, his fidelity to NATO had earned him the right to expect firm American support against Egypt, and when that support proved not forthcoming, he became even more determined that if the Americans were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> about Nasser, then France would act.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the male}} protagonists of NOW. A good person at first but is becomes twisted and evil by a {{traumatic}} incident in the first volume. Originally sent with his brothers to destroy Sashinmu's secrets upon his swordmaster's last wishes. He discovered his older brother had secretly been working for an opposing force, and was nearly killed by him. It was this brother's sword that left the scar on his cheek. Together, the two plunge into a chasm, and he barely survived unlike his brother. He acquires the Sashinmu killing technique from reading the Sashinmu book {{with the purpose of}} changing the world so as to acknowledge his strength and, indirectly, his reason for existing. Yu Sae-Ha's style of Sashinmu is unique, for it utilizes negative (ice / Yin) ki instead of positive (fire / Yang) ki, as a result of him having absorbed Yhun Ah-Ran's ki. Originally starting out as a shy and timid character, Yu Sae-Ha grows obsessed with power as the story goes on, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to become stronger. He harbors feelings for Yhun Ah-Ran.|$|E

500|$|As Grant moved south against Lee in the Overland Campaign, Union Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler {{launched}} the surprise Bermuda Hundred Campaign with landings up the James River. Beauregard successfully lobbied with Jefferson Davis's military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of Richmond {{to the aid}} of Lee. His timely action, coupled with the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army, nullifying its threat to Petersburg and Lee's supply line. Now that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops from Beauregard's front to Lee's. Beauregard did send a division (Maj. Gen. Robert Hoke's) to Lee for the Battle of Cold Harbor, but Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard command of {{the right wing of the}} Army of Northern Virginia for his cooperation. Beauregard replied in a passive–aggressive manner, [...] "I am <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for our success, but cannot leave my Department without orders of War Department." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{writer of}} Rolling Stone {{compared}} the black-and-white {{look of the}} video with Madonna's [...] "Vogue", 1920s German Expressionist cinema and Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal. He further noted influences from Liza Minnelli, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' [...] "Don't Come Around Here No More", and Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. A writer of The Independent wrote, [...] "Showing Gaga {{in a number of}} guises (as a Beatnik performance artist, her face smeared with clown make-up, sporting David Bowie-esque androgyny while wearing a bra made of black, leather gloves and as various winged creatures), the high energy accompaniment to her new track is a hotch-potch of imagery that seems to highlight the pop princess' ever changing appearance." [...] Chris Rovzar of Vanity Fair described the video as a moving photo shoot for Interview magazine [...] "except with more sanity". Rovzar concluded that it also featured [...] "the standard Gaga nonsense" [...] and praised Gaga's smile during several scenes of the video as a highlight. James Montgomery of MTV News saw the video as Gaga [...] "pulling the curtain back on her creative process, showing the viewer how she's <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to please the public." [...] Melinda Newman of Hitfix felt Gaga [...] "continues her one-woman performance art with the very theatrical video" [...] and interpreted it as showing that [...] "there is nothing Lady Gaga won’t do to get your attention".|$|E
500|$|Jim calls Wallace {{to pitch}} for the CEO {{to invest in}} Athlead. Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap.
