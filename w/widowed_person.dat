40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{examine the}} effect of time on suicide after {{bereavement}} among <b>widowed</b> <b>persons.</b> METHOD: The data were extracted from Swiss mortality statistics for the period 1987 - 2005. The time between bereavement and subsequent death, specifically by suicide, was determined by linkage of individual records of married persons. The suicide rates and the standardized mortality ratios in the first week/month/year of widowhood were calculated based on person-year calculations. RESULTS: The annualized suicide rates in <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> were highest in the first week after bereavement: 941 males and 207 females per 100, 000. The corresponding standardized mortality ratios were approximately 34 and 19 respectively. In the first month(s) after bereavement, the rates and the ratios decreased, first rapidly, then gradually. Except in older widows, they did not reach the baseline levels during the first year after bereavement. CONCLUSIONS: The suicide risk of <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> is increased in the days, weeks and months after bereavement. <b>Widowed</b> <b>persons</b> are a clear-cut risk group under the aegis of undertakers, priests and general practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Beliefs of a {{successful}} partnership influence goals, motivations, and behaviour in romantic relationships. Life transitions could have an influence on the personal templates of an ideal partnership. Every critical life event generates a discrepancy between perceptions and individual standards, which drives emotions and cognitions and motivates behaviour designed to reduce or resolve the discrepancy. We examined {{the differences between the}} beliefs of {{a successful}} relationship that divorced spouses, <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> and long-term married couples (N = 800, age 62 – 91 years) subscribe to, regarding what constitutes a successful marriage, and how their assumptions relate to various subjective dimensions of well-being. Results revealed that the prioritization given to the key elements {{of a successful}} relationship (i. e., mutual respect in long-term married couples, successful communication in divorced spouses and love in <b>widowed</b> <b>persons)</b> varied among the groups. Comparing low and high scores for individual well-being resulted in differences between beliefs of a successful partnership held by divorced and <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> but not married couples. These findings provide important considerations for counselling persons after the loss of a partner due to separation, divorce or death. An idealized view of the deceased spouse as a soulmate and emphasis on the shared love could be adaptive for <b>widowed</b> <b>persons,</b> whereas the emphasis on successful communication techniques could be an important step in improving cognitive and emotional well-being for divorced persons...|$|R

40|$|We {{document}} in this paper, the economic consequences upon widowhood using both cross- section and panel data from European Community Household Panel. Main conclusions are as what follows. First, {{there is a}} large difference across country. The <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> in Greece and Portugal have lowest income, less than a half of that of Austrian <b>widowed</b> <b>persons.</b> Cross-country difference decreases somewhat if we consider household income net of housing costs due to higher home- ownership in low income countries. Second, income reduction upon widowhood is in general larger among widows than widowers. The gender difference is largest in Denmark, Spain, Austria and Finland, where widowers enjoy more than 30 % higher income than widows. Third, the main culprit of gender difference in income situation of <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> is the pension regulation. As many widowed women depend on survivorship pension as their main income source and as the survivorship pension is much lower than old-age pension in most countries, widows suffer much larger income reduction than widowers with widowhood. As current elderly women and those in many coming years lived their working ages in a world where wives and mothers worked at home, raised children and did not work in the market, they will depend mostly on survivorship pension as their main income source. Consequently, their economic situation would not improve in the medium term unless pension regulations change to improve their economic situation...|$|R

Data are from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries–Medicare–linked database (1991 – 1999). The sample consisted of 14, 630 men and women 65 years old and older. The outcomes were melanoma stage at diagnosis and melanoma specific survival. The main independent variable, marital status, was used in four categories: married, single, separated or divorced, and widowed.

Setting: random sample of home care clients in Reykjavik area. Subjects: 257 individuals were assessed with the Minimum Data Set for Home Care (InterRAI- HC) instrument. Results: 20. 3 % of home care clients expressed loneliness, 18. 3 % of men and 20. 9 % of women with <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> being {{more likely to be}} lonely than married persons, p= 0. 013, as were they who assessed their health as being poor, p= 0. 042. Women with cognitive impairment {{were more likely to be}} lonely, p= 0. 022 and they were more likely to have depressive symptoms, p= 0. 025. Women who took more than six medications were more likely to be lonely (79. 2 % vs. 20. 8 %, p= 0. 018). Lonely women took more neuroleptics (p= 0. 007) but lonely males more hypnotics (p= 0. 046).

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that bereavement associated {{with the loss of}} a loved one may result in depression, a decline in social relationships, and poorer health amongst the bereaved. Studies on bereavement suggest that bereaved persons try to have continuity of roles in their lives and eventually recover from the loss of a loved one. The current study examines whether <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> engage in health-related coping strategies (H-RCS) (ie. smoking, drinking, and exercise) as an initial result of spousal loss. Using the Stress and Coping Model posited by Lazarus and Folkman (1984), it is hypothesized that <b>widowed</b> <b>persons</b> with greater levels of social support, religiosity, income, self-efficacy, and self-rated health will be less likely to engage in health-related coping behaviors than their counterparts. ^ The current study utilizes secondary data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples study (CLOC), a prospective study of bereavement, and Ordinary Least Squares, Negative Binomial Regression, and Logistic Regression to analyze the proposed relationship between widowhood and health-related coping strategies across three available waves of data collected 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months after spousal loss. ^ Findings reveal that bereavement is indeed related to engagement in H-RCS, although this effect is moderated primarily through self-efficacy. More specifically, bereavement influenced physical inactivity and health behavior at Wave 1 and generated higher daily cigarette consumption by Wave 3. The only exception was in the Wave 3 regression equation where lower levels of bereavement predicted physical inactivity. This finding suggests that low bereavement may actually be deleterious to health {{depending on the type of}} health-related coping strategy examined. ^ No significance was found between bereavement and any health-related coping strategy by Wave 2 and across all significant bereavement models there was no significant alcohol effect. The most pronounced effect for bereavement outcomes were for physical inactivity models at Waves 1 and 2. The results of this study do not provide support that bereaved adults engage in alcohol consumption as a result of spousal loss. However, findings do reveal that the widowed may be particularly susceptible to engaging in H-RCS 6 months and 18 months after spousal loss. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study {{explored}} {{whether the}} economic benefits of marriage mediate the association between marriage and health and if that relationship is conditional {{on the level of}} shared economic resources. Methods. Pooled, cross-sectional data from NHANES 2001 – 2006 were analyzed using multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial regression for the number of days of inactivity due to poor physical or mental health.
