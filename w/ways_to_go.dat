25|$|Following {{their return}} from exile in Geneva {{during the reign}} of Queen Mary I and King Philip, English Protestants known as Puritans (who {{remained}} within the Church of England) and separatists (who separated from it) began to attempt to introduce some of the more radical reforms they had experienced in Geneva into the worship of the Church of England, and in some <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> beyond them. They sought to rid worship of any element not specifically prescribed in the Bible, though they disagreed on the practical implications of this. They also favored liturgical decisions to be made at the lowest level possible, rather than by a regional or national authority.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice for}} Satan, {{provided}} by Parker, {{was inspired by}} the voice of the Pinhead character at the ending of the 1988 horror film, , when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life, when he was a good person. The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, [...] "There's so many <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with him and we couldn't figure out the right one for a long time". The large and muscular look of the character stemmed {{from the fact that the}} script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.|$|E

2500|$|Postmodern {{designers}} were in {{the beginning}} stages of what we now refer to as [...] "graphic design". They created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. They also seemed to entirely {{pay no attention to}} traditional conventions such as legibility. Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that [...] "retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates". Yet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched for more and more <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> against the system. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Tibor Kalman, and Jamie Reid.|$|E
2500|$|... "Gollum's Song" [...] (The Two Towers) {{performed}} by Emilíana Torrini is musically related to Gollum's Pity Theme. The lyrics are by Fran Walsh. Released as a Single {{and as a}} music video featuring footage from the film. The song {{was to have been}} {{performed by}} Björk, whose name actually appeared in the closing credits of the film as shown in theaters; Björk had to decline because of her pregnancy, however, and Torrini was credited in the DVD. This track is also titled [...] "Long <b>Ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> Yet," [...] in The Complete Recordings. This version of the track includes additional instrumental music at the end, making it a medley of themes to cap off the album. Artist Geoff Keezer has released a jazz piano version of the song.

2500|$|Krauthammer {{has said}} of his writing {{in support of the}} Reagan Doctrine, [...] "I {{basically}} came to the conclusion ... the Soviets had overextended their empire, and they were getting what the West had gotten with its overextended empire decades before a reaction, they got a rebellion, they got resistance. And the Soviets were now beginning to feel it, and the genius of Reagan, although I don’t think they had a plan in doing this is he instinctively realized that one of the <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after the Soviets was indirect, and that is you go after their proxies, you go after their allies, you go after their clients, or even in Afghanistan you go after them directly. So that’s what I called the Reagan Doctrine, it was sort of the opposite of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which was whatever we control we keep. And Reagan was saying, no you don’t." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucky and Luke start a {{slow process}} of {{reconciling}} when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident. Lucky's relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas's father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been {{trying to change the}} way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer." [...] The former enemies become friends, a sign of Lucky's growth of character. Actress Genie Francis (Laura) explained to Soap Opera Digest in April 1999: [...] "It's huge, absolutely huge. (It's) something that really seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [...] with his big heart and his maturity." [...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each. Guza explained: [...] "They still have a <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> {{but the important thing is}} they're making the inroads now. (...) I wouldn't say it's the final resolution between them, but they're well on their way toward it." ...|$|E

60|$|We inquired of {{him what}} we should next do towards getting to the seaside. He told us we were about one hundred and twenty English leagues from the coast, where almost all the European {{settlements}} and factories were, and which is called the Gold Coast; but that {{there were so many}} different nations of negroes in the way, that it was ten to one if we were not either fought with continually, or starved for want of provisions; but that there were two other <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> which, if he had had any company to go with him, he had often contrived to make his escape by. The one was to travel full west, which, though it was farther to go, yet was not so full of people, and the people we should find would be so much the civiller to us, or be so much the easier to fight with; or that the other way was, if possible, to get to the Rio Grande, and go down the stream in canoes. We told him, that was the way we had resolved on before we met with him; but then he told us there was a prodigious desert to go over, and as prodigious woods to go through, before we came to it, and that both together were at least twenty days' march for us, travel as hard as we could.|$|E

He shrunk, as he said, from knowing that people he met were aware that his days were numbered, and even with me after our first conversation on the subject, he made no allusion whatever to it. He was as cheery and bright as ever, and when I last met him a week ago, even I who knew the circumstances, could see no difference whatever in his manner. I thought he was wrong, at first, but I {{came to the conclusion}} afterwards that his decision was not an unwise one. He spared you three months of unavailing pain; he had no fear of death, and was able to go about as before to meet his friends without his health being a subject of discussion, and in all <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on as usual until the call came. His death was evidently painless; he sat down in his easy arm-chair after lunch for his usual half-hour's nap, and evidently expired in his sleep. The servant found him, as he believed, still asleep when he came in to tell him that the carriage was at the door, and it was only on touching him he discovered what had happened. They sent the carriage off at once to fetch Dr. Edwards. He looked in at my office and took me over with him, and I got back in time to write to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Most {{of us are}} idolators, and ascribe divine {{powers to}} the abstractions [...] "Force," [...] "Gravity," [...] "Vitality," [...] which our own brains have created. I do not know {{anything}} about [...] "inert" [...] things in nature. If we reduce the world to matter and motion, the matter is not [...] "inert," [...] inasmuch as {{the same amount of}} motion affects different kinds of matter in different <b>ways.</b> <b>To</b> <b>go</b> back to my own illustration. The fabric of the watch is not inert, every particle of it is in violent and rapid motion, and the winding-up simply perturbs the whole infinitely complicated system in a particular fashion. Equilibrium means death, because life is a succession of changes, while a changing equilibrium is a contradiction m terms. I am not at all clear that a living being is comparable to a machine running down. On this side of the question the whirlpool affords a better parallel than the watch. If you dam the stream above or below; the whirlpool dies; just as the living being does if you cut off its food, or choke it with its own waste products. And if you alter the sides or bottom of the stream you may kill the whirlpool, just as you kill the animal by interfering with its structure. Heat and oxidation as a source of heat appear to supply energy to the living machine, the molecular structure of the germ furnishing the [...] "sides and bottom of the stream," [...] that is, determining the results which the energy supplied shall produce.|$|E

60|$|Looked at {{from above}} this ridge {{was indeed a}} {{beautiful}} and rugged backbone of rock, sloping from the rim, extending far out and down--a very narrow knife-edge extended promontory, green with cedar and pine, yellow and gray with its crags and rocks. A craggy point comparable {{to some of those}} in the Grand Canyon! We had to study a way to get across the first deep fissures, and eventually descended far under the crest and climbed back. It was desperately hard work, for we had so little time. R.C. was to be at the middle of that ridge and I at the end in an hour. Like Trojans we worked. Some slippery pine-needle slopes we had to run across, for light quick steps were the only means of safe travel. And that was not safe! When we surmounted to the crest we found a jumble of weathered rocks ready to slide down on either side. Slabs, pyramids, columns, shale, rocks of all shapes except round, lay toppling along the heaved ridge. It seemed the whole ridge was ready to thunder down into the abyss. Half a mile down and out from the rim we felt lost, marooned. But there was something splendidly thrilling in our conquest of that narrow upflung edge of mountain. Twice R.C. thought we would have to abandon further progress, but I found <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. How lonely and wild out there! No foot save an Indian's had ever trod those gray rocks or brown mats of pine needles.|$|E
