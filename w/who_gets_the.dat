5|$|In the present, Black {{realizes that}} the current murderer must be Hance's former cellmate Jacob Tyler (Scott Heindl). Black visits Hance in prison, and upon {{speaking}} to Hance, realizes that Tyler believes himself Hance's reincarnation, aspiring to follow his methods exactly. Meanwhile, Tyler calls the police and leaves an anonymous tip, telling them that the liquor store murderer is hiding in an abandoned building. Black accompanies a SWAT team encircling the building, but the officers come under sniper fire from a construction site across the street. Black and Bletcher separate as they search for Tyler, <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> drop on Black. Black disarms Tyler, attempting to talk him into surrendering. Tyler empties a handgun at Black, but misses; when Bletcher confronts him, Tyler points the gun and Bletcher instinctively shoots and kills him.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as he watches the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E

500|$|Note that in FIBA play, if {{the shooter}} commits the violation, {{it is an}} {{automatic}} turnover. If the shot is successful and the shooter does not commit a violation, but other players do commit a violation, all violations are discarded.

500|$|He {{made his}} {{credited}} film {{debut in the}} low-budget independent comedy-drama Living in Oblivion (1995) where he performed alongside Steve Buscemi. The film {{tells the story of}} a director, crew, and cast filming a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. Dinklage's role was that of a frustrated actor with dwarfism who complains about his clichéd roles. The film has been well received by critics. The following year he appeared as a building manager in the crime drama Bullet starring rapper Tupac Shakur. Even after his well-received performance in Living in Oblivion, Dinklage still could not find someone willing to be his agent. After a recommendation from Buscemi to the director Alexandre Rockwell, Dinklage was cast in the comedy 13 Moons (2002). When later interviewed for a theater website, he was asked what his ideal role was, and he replied [...] "the romantic lead" [...] <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> girl.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits.

I am not the sort <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E

500|$|Australia batted {{first and}} Loxton {{came in to}} bat {{in front of a}} {{supportive}} home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He made 80, putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey, who made his first Test century in his second international match, as Australia amassed 8/575. The debutant all-rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey [...] "was going along merrily and he soon settled me down". Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings. Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent, Brown threw the ball to his debutants. Johnson was given the ball first change, but failed to make an impact, so Loxton was handed his chance. He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2/61 in the first innings, removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad. In the words of Brown, the Victorian all-rounder [...] "looked twice the bowler Johnson did". The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings. The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948. He reflected that [...] "It's not the fellow <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> opportunity it's the fellow who puts his hands around it and grabs it. I just {{happened to be in the}} right place at the right time." [...] After his position in the touring party was confirmed, he continued his late-season resurgence, scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England.|$|E
500|$|Weems {{picks up}} a lottery ticket and wins $100,000 but learns {{that it would take}} 12 months to get the money, so he throws the ticket away. A man picks the ticket out of the trash and is then hit by a truck after Weems warned him (to no avail) that [...] "something bad will happen." [...] Later, Mulder comes to {{question}} Weems again and another one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems but his bullet ricochets off Weems' pocket knife, barely grazes Mulder's arm, and hits and kills the enforcer. Weems confesses that he's been {{trying to find a way}} to get $100,000 to pay for an expensive medical treatment for the serious illness of a boy in his apartment building named Richie (Shia LaBeouf). Weems attempts at getting the money, however, have brought him above the radar. Later, after Weems is hit by a car, it appears that Henry's lucky streak has reached its end. Cutrona kidnaps Richie's mom, Maggie, to stop Henry from testifying against him. Weems turns himself in to Cutrona so he would let Maggie go; instead, they plan to kill him. As they are about to execute Weems in the basement (where Maggie is also being held), Cutrona and his mobster partner, Dominic, are killed in a bizarre turn of events, whereas Weems and Maggie are unharmed as Mulder arrives with backup. In the end, it turns out by surprise that Cutrona is an organ donor and a perfect match for Richie, <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> treatment and lives. Weems then activates a toy Goldberg machine that he made for Richie earlier.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEfficiency {{could be}} not only the ratio of {{weighted}} sum of outputs to that of inputs but also that of weighted sum of inputs to that of outputs. When the previous efficiency measures the best relative efficiency {{within the range of}} no more than one, the decision-making units (DMUs) <b>who</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> optimum value of one perform best among all the DMUs. If the previous efficiency is measured within the range of no less than one, <b>the</b> DMUs <b>who</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> optimum value of one perform worst among all the DMUs. When the later efficiency is measured within the range of no more than one, <b>the</b> DMUs <b>who</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> optimum value of one perform worst among all the DMUs. If the later efficiency is measured within the range of no less than one, <b>the</b> DMUs <b>who</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> optimum value of one perform best among all the DMUs. This paper mainly studies an interval DEA model with later efficiency, in which efficiency is measured within the range of an interval, whose upper bound is set to one and the lower bound is determined by introducing a virtual ideal DMU, whose performance is definitely superior to any DMUs. The efficiencies, obtained from interval DEA model, turn out to be all intervals and are referred to as interval efficiencies, which combine the best and the worst relative efficiency in a reasonable manner to give an overall assessment of performances for all DMUs. Assessor's preference information on input and output weights is also incorporated into interval DEA model reasonably and conveniently. Through an example, some differences are found from the ranking results obtained from interval DEA model and bounded DEA model using the Hurwicz criterion approach to rank the interval efficiencies...|$|R
