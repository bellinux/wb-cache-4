50|$|Following the {{installation}} of the P3/P4 Truss to the ISS by the Canadarm2, Tanner and Stefanyshyn-Piper began their spacewalk to activate the truss at 09:17 UTC. During the EVA they installed power and data cables between the P1 & P3/P4 trusses, released the P3/P4 truss' launch restraints {{and a number of other}} tasks to configure the truss for upcoming activities. The spacewalk was so successful that the astronauts carried out a number of tasks scheduled for later EVAs, with the eventual completion of the EVA at 15:43 UTC. A bolt, spring and <b>washer</b> <b>assembly</b> from a launch lock was lost during these extra activities and floated off into space.|$|E
5000|$|Scagel used a half stag {{and half}} leather stacked <b>washer</b> <b>assembly</b> in his knife handles that became his {{trademark}} style. One such Scagel knife provided the influence for Bo Randall {{to start making}} his own knives. In 1937, Randall witnessed someone using a Scagel knife to scrape paint off of a boat near Walloon Lake, without damaging {{the edge of the}} blade. Randall bought the knife and {{in the years that followed}} Scagel became a mentor to Randall, influencing many of his designs. [...] In addition to leather and stag handles, Scagel had several friends who worked at the Brunswick Pool Table and Bowling Ball Company who kept him supplied with scrap pieces of ivory, rosewood, bakelite, vulcanized fiber, and maple spacers which he used in his knife handles over the years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to apply the correct engineering principles to establish the relationship between tightening torque and bolt preload and to verify the loosening characteristics of bolted joint under transverse vibration condition by experimental setup under the application of wrenching torque. A simplified bolted joint including a holed plate with assembly of single bolt and Multiple Jack Bolt Nut was considered to carry out the experiments. The same experiment was carried out with the standard nut with spring <b>washer</b> <b>assembly</b> for comparison. Experiment was carried out on a test setup called as Junker’s Transverse Vibration Machine. The relation between the clamping force and number of cycles have been displayed in graphs...|$|E
40|$|During 100 h {{servicing}} of an aeroengine, chips were {{noticed in}} the oil system. Strip examination of the engine revealed severe damages to the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of the engine accessory gearbox with cage broken and lying inside the casing along with the balls. In addition, on the cover side, the bush on O 3 axis was found without nuts and tab washers. The damaged bearing along with the dislodged nuts and tab washers were sent to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that there was spalling, smearing and flow of material in all elements of the cover side bearing. There was sliding in the bearing due to breakage of the cage resulting in loss of shape of the balls and flow of material out of inner raceway. Fractographic study confirmed that the cage of the bearing had failed by fatigue. This, along with the signatures of failure in the bearing as a whole indicated that the failure was progressive in nature, and it was caused due to rotational creep from either inner ring being loose or outer ring being loose or excessive axial load. Since there is remote possibility of excessive axial load on the bearing on O 3 axis of the EAGB, looseness in the inner ring and/or outer ring or any problem(s) elsewhere which could give rise to similar situation {{appears to be the}} reason for the bearing failure. Laboratory examination did not reveal any damages to the dislodged nuts except for rubbing marks along all six edges of the nut faces. The Cu-plating on all the faces was found undisturbed. The threads were found to be in tact without any distress. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bush nuts have come out of the bolts by progressive unwinding. This is further substantiated by the presence of rubbing marks on all the six edges of the nuts, which is possible only when the nuts rotate around the axis, that is, the bolts, and they make contact periodically with the tab washer surface. The two tab washers provided for examination showed fretting damage on the contacting surfaces with the nuts as well as the bush. This is indicative of relative movement of the tab <b>washers</b> in <b>assembly</b> in service. Examination also revealed that the bending of the tab washers for effecting the locking of the nuts was oblique and also, the contact between the tab washer and the nut faces was inadequate. This was evident from the contact marks available on the tab washer surfaces. Evidences suggest that the nut surface was in partial contact with the tab washer and hence, the locking was not effective enough to offer adequate resistance for preventing unwinding of the nuts even under normal operating conditions. Once there was unwinding of the nuts, the bush on the cover side was as good as unsupported. This is similar to a situation wherein the outer ring of the bearing is loose. Hence, the looseness in the bush would result in progressive failure in the bearing as seen in the present case. The disturbances caused because of progressive failure in the cover side bearing had resulted in initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of the bearing on the casing side as well. Hence, the damages to this bearing are secondary in nature. Laboratory studies did not reveal any metallurgical deficiencies in the bearing elements or in the tab washers which could give rise to the present failure. Also, negligible discolouration even after complete destruction of the bearing indicates that there were no lubrication related issues which could be the cause of failure. Based on the above, it is concluded that the failure in the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of EAGB was progressive in nature. The failure was resulted due to unwinding and dislodgement of the nuts meant for securing the bush in position. Investigation showed that the unwinding of the nuts was possible because of deficiency in locking mechanism. Therefore, the primary cause for the bearing failure is attributed to either improper <b>assembly</b> of tab <b>washers</b> or inappropriate choice of the tab washer type for the present application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a series of tests performed using in. diameter A 325 and A 490 bolts. The resulting relationship between torque – tension for the bolt – nut – <b>washer</b> <b>assembly</b> is used to explain its behavior as the length and location of treatment surface are varied. Tests were performed upon one hundred sixty four bolts; eighty A 325 of three inches in length, fifty-two A 325 of six inches in length, twenty A 490 of three inches in length, and twelve A 490 of six inches in length. One hundred sixty four nuts and washers were tested, one hundred nuts type 2 H, and fifty six nuts type C and eight nuts type D to determine the effect of the variables (nut type, bolt length, bolt type and Control Fluid) on the torque-tension relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assembly. Hundreds of experiments using replicate samples for statistical reli-ability were conducted to establish the effect of the variables on the tension-torque relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assemblage. The principal relationship in turn-of-nut installation is that between elongation and bolt pretension, the tension-torque relationship is the factor that reflects the bolt pretension in an installation to be expected in a properly tightened connection. Control Fluid was found to decrease the coefficient of friction on coated parts and to control the tension obtained with a given torque upon assembly...|$|E
