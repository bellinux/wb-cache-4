In a ruling, given in an Opinion, the commission has to cover al questions involved, and every name dealt with should be placed either on the Official List or on the Index.

60|$|Assuredly, we must {{conclude}} so, {{if we are}} {{to credit}} the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length-- Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his <b>work</b> (<b>page</b> 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.|$|E

30|$|Happiness and {{wellbeing}} at {{work has}} been defined {{in a number of}} ways. Definitions include: the presence of positive experiences and absence of negative experiences (Cotton and Hart 2003); workplace affect and job satisfaction (Page and Vella-Brodrick 2009) and more broadly as a positive state of mind arising from one’s experiences at <b>work</b> (<b>Page</b> 2005). Fisher (2010) proposes that happiness at work should be treated as a multidimensional concept, and argues that measures of work happiness such as job satisfaction (Locke 1976), positive affect (Fisher 1997) and thriving and vigor (Spreitzer and Sonenshein 2004) are too narrow. She proposes a higher-order approach to conceptualizing ‘work happiness’ and suggests it is the combination of three aspects: (a) engagement with the work itself; (b) satisfaction with the job and, (c) feelings of affective commitment to the organization as a whole. This multi-dimensional model of work happiness parallels recent developments in wellbeing theory to multi-dimensional frameworks (e.g. Huppert and So 2013; Seligman 2011).|$|E

The seminar was proposed {{as a means}} of attracting more members from the south inner city community and other agencies to join Community Response in an attempt to try to build an effective response to drug abuse in the community. Prior to the seminar a questionnaire was circulated to tenants and community organisations seeking information on {{the nature and extent of}} the local drug problem. The seminar was introduced by Hugh Cahill and chaired by Mary Ellen McCann. Recommendations include a need to address the socio-economic causes of the drug problem, examination of the school curriculum, the appointment of a drugs co-ordinator for Dublin, concentration of state resources in areas most affected by drugs and early prevention by education in primary schools.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Composability is the {{capability}} to select and assemble simulation components in various combinations into simulation systems to satisfy specific user requirements. The defining characteristic of composability {{is the ability to}} combine and recombine components. Composability exists in two forms, syntactic and semantic (also known as engineering and modeling). Syntactic composability is the implementation of components {{so that they can be}} connected. Semantic composability is the question of whether the models implemented in the composed components can be meaningfully composed, i. e., is their combined computation valid? A theory of semantic composability has been developed that examines the semantic composability of models using formal definitions and reasoning. The computational complexity of the problem of selecting a set of components that meet a set of objectives is examined. In earlier <b>work,</b> <b>Page</b> and Opper defined four variants of this component selection problem based on two forms of objectives decidability (bounded and unbounded) and two forms of composition (emergent and non-emergent). They gave a proof that the bounded non-emergent variant of the component selection problem is NP-complete. In this paper an additional form of composition (anti-emergent) is defined, leading to two additional variants of the problem. Then a general form of the component selection problem that subsumes all six variants is defined. The general component selection problem is proven to be NP-complete even if the objectives met by a component or composition are known. Several related but different problems, including determining the objectives met by a component and determining the validity of a proposed composition are defined, and conjectures for their complexity are given. 1...|$|E
