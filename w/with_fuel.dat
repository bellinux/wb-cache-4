5|$|This {{aircraft}} was given J57-P-43W engines {{with a larger}} capacity water injection system to provide greater thrust than previous models. This model had problems <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> leaks which were eventually solved by several service modifications: Blue Band, Hard Shell, and QuickClip.|$|E
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E

5|$|Beset {{by early}} {{construction}} problems, the first FSD aircraft {{was transferred to}} Groom Lake in May1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> leaks, delayed the first flight. Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft took off on 18June for its maiden flight, nine months after the July1980 first flight originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October1983; the 59th and last F-117 was delivered in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Between 13 January and 3 April 1943, an {{estimated}} 500,000 Red Army soldiers {{took part in}} what {{was known as the}} Voronezh–Kharkov Offensive. In all, {{an estimated}} 6,100,000 Soviet soldiers were committed to the area, with another 659,000 out of action with wounds. In comparison, the Germans could account for 2,200,000 personnel on the Eastern Front, with another 100,000 deployed in Norway. As a result, the Red Army deployed around twice as many personnel as the Wehrmacht in early February. However, {{as a result of their}} over-extension and the casualties they had taken during their offensive, at the beginning of Manstein's counterattack the Germans could achieve a tactical superiority in numbers, including the number of tanks present—for example, Manstein's 350 tanks outnumbered Soviet armor almost seven to one at the point of contact, and were far better supplied <b>with</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded <b>with</b> <b>fuel,</b> causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E

5|$|Petrov {{also became}} a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at its first convocation. In 1938, the corps was {{converted}} into the 15th Tank Corps. He participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, during which he led the corps in the Battle of Grodno. During the invasion, the corps was resupplied <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> by parachute. On 4 June 1940, {{he was promoted to}} major general. In July 1940 he became deputy commander of the 6th Mechanized Corps. In October he became inspector of armor for the Western Special Military District. In 1941, Petrov graduated from higher academic courses at the Military Academy of the General Staff. On 11 March 1941, he was appointed commander of the 17th Mechanized Corps, which was stationed near Slonim. The 17th Mechanized Corps was a cadre-strength formation equipped with only 36 tanks.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E
5|$|The Hawkins-class cruiser was {{designed}} to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas. This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders. The design was also given high freeboard {{to allow it to}} maintain its speed in heavy weather. Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> no matter the supply conditions. Four ships were ordered, named after famous Elizabethan seafarers, in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916, named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish. By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended, so construction proceeded slowly.|$|E

5|$|These sister {{stations}} were of similar design and were built, opened, and closed together. Stella South, with a generating capacity of 300megawatts (MW), {{was built on}} the site of the Blaydon Races, and Stella North, with a capacity of 240MW, on that of the former Lemington Hall. They powered local homes and the many heavy industries of Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and County Durham. The large buildings, chimneys and cooling towers were visible from afar. Their operation required coal trains on both sides of the river to supply them <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> and river traffic by flat iron barges to dump ash in the North Sea. After their closure in 1991, they were demolished in stages between 1992 and 1997.

5|$|Three B-29s {{based on}} Guam, which had spotless mission records and no {{mechanical}} difficulties, {{were selected for}} the mission. In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were faired over with smooth metal to minimize parasitic drag. Blister-type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad tank car. Filled <b>with</b> <b>fuel</b> and 12 men, each ship weighed —it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E
5|$|When the Romanians {{entered the}} war on 27 August 1916, the {{monitors}} were again at Rustschuk, and were immediately attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors but struck a lighter loaded <b>with</b> <b>fuel.</b> Tasked with shelling Giurgiu the following day, the Second Monitor Division, consisting of Bodrog and three other monitors, set fire to oil storage tanks, the railway station and magazines, and sank several Romanian lighters. While the attack was underway, the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. Bodrog and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised minelayer {{on their way back}} to Belene. This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene, during which both Turnu Măgurele and Zimnicea were shelled.|$|E
