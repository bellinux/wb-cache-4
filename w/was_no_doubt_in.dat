25|$|Professor Erik Lönnroth of the Swedish Academy, who {{described}} the assistance provided by Munck did assert {{that there is}} no factual basis for the assumption that Gustav III was homosexual. When his second son was born, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> anyone as to his legitimacy, and the boy was strong and healthy. King Gustav was especially fond of him and suffered obvious and severe mental and physical reactions to the baby's illness and death. The spring of 1783 has been considered {{a turning point in the}} king's personality. After his controversial mother's death in 1782, he found consolation in the birth of the Duke of Småland, but this was followed by severe grief when the child died the following year.|$|E

By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her {{confidence}} had grown; [...] "This time around, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> her mind that she had earned her place". Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has {{said that she had}} answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law, of whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton, believing that she concluded she could be [...] "both brilliant and black." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were {{a violent}} temper and rash, {{impulsive}} nature, which undoubtedly contributed {{to some of}} his decisions. Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. He had a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader. This <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general. He had great self-restraint in [...] "pleasures of the body", in contrast with his lack of self-control with alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Burton, who {{finished}} second, {{was happy with}} his performance, [...] " [...] Todd Berrier has come in and done a great job, the team’s done a great job. We had one hiccough early on pit road {{but the rest of}} them we picked out our spots every single time, and that’s what it takes; it takes a team effort." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> my mind they were going to come this week and make a statement. Obviously leading all the laps pretty much and winning the race sends a statement out there that he is the best, that they're not going to be denied this year." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bamboo Annals also {{mention that}} Yu {{appointed}} Yi as his successor, but mention nothing of Yi's reigning, stating only that Yu's son Qi took {{the throne of}} Xia after the 3 years of mourning for Yu. It relates that Boyi (Yi or Yih) died in Qi's 6th year and that Qi [...] "appointed a sacrifice for him". However, in a footnote, translator James Legge observes: [...] "This account does {{not agree with the}} account of the death of Yih, which is often attributed to the Annals, and which <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> some of the Bamboo Books; viz. that 'Yih was aiming at the throne, and K'e [...] put him to death'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike many umpires, Evans {{never made}} claims to infallibility. [...] "I missed {{a lot of}} {{decision}}s", he once said. [...] "At the time of making such a decision there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> my mind as to its correctness. However, {{a second or two}} later I felt that I erred and wished I could change my original ruling". Evans' humility and impartiality did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sports writers Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, [...] "roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands". On September 15, 1907, {{in the midst of a}} doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious. The New York Times described the incident as [...] "one of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed on a ball field".|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stones {{lead singer}} Mick Jagger, {{who had already}} been punched {{in the head by}} a concertgoer within seconds of {{emerging}} from his helicopter, was visibly intimidated by the unruly situation and urged everyone to, [...] "Just be cool down in the front there, don't push around." [...] During the third song, [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", a fight erupted {{in the front of the}} crowd at the foot of the stage, prompting the Stones to pause their set while the Angels restored order. After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of [...] "Under My Thumb". Some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with Meredith Hunter, age 18, when he attempted to get onstage with other fans. One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter's head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd. [...] After a minute's pause, Hunter returned to the stage [...] where, according to Gimme Shelter producer Porter Bibb, Hunter's girlfriend Patty Bredehoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her; but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and so high he could barely walk. Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, [...] "I saw what he was looking at, that he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> my mind that he intended to do terrible harm to Mick or somebody in the Rolling Stones, or somebody on that stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|ABC {{required}} Wallenda to wear {{a safety}} harness for the walk. After {{the decision was made}} in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: [...] "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." [...] Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating [...] "It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything." [...] The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. [...] During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt [...] "like a jackass" [...] wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. [...] "When I first found out about it, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. [...] "But as [...] got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." [...] He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. [...] "The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people," [...] he said. [...] "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." [...] In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.|$|E
