5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity <b>with</b> <b>examples</b> of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent <b>with</b> <b>examples</b> from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E

These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in {{medicinal plants}} is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where medicinal plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines.

5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms <b>with</b> <b>examples</b> of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E
5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As <b>with</b> <b>examples</b> located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand's {{geographic}} isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced {{evolution of the}} country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation, and this {{has resulted in a}} dynamic evolutionary ecology <b>with</b> <b>examples</b> of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species. About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family. The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40% of these are endemic. The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates. The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow {{on the inner side}} and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens <b>with</b> <b>examples</b> of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E
