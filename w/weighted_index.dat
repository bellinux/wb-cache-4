40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a bivariate {{generalization}} of a <b>weighted</b> <b>indexed</b> semi-Markov chains to study the high frequency price dynamics of traded stocks. We assume that financial returns are described by a <b>weighted</b> <b>indexed</b> semi-Markov chain model. We show, through Monte Carlo simulations, that the model is able to reproduce important stylized facts of financial time series like the persistence of volatility {{and at the same time}} it can reproduce the correlation between stocks. The model is applied to data from Italian stock market from 1 January 2007 until the end of December 2010.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{effectiveness}} of different property portfolio diversification strategies using five methods; (1) correlation matrices, (2) efficient frontiers, (3) Sharpe ratios, using three different sub methods, (4) coefficients in equations explaining total returns and (5) R-square values in equations explaining total returns. The evaluation methods are applied to both value weighted and equally <b>weighted</b> <b>indices</b> based on Swedish real estate return data. All methods show that, if any, diversifying over property types is a better strategy on the Swedish market than diversifying over regions. No test yields significant support for regional diversification. The support for the property type strategy is stronger when using equally <b>weighted</b> <b>indices.</b> QC 20170512 </p...|$|R

40|$|Working Paper GATE 2008 - 01 In the paper, we {{introduce}} {{and study}} generalized <b>weighted</b> influence <b>indices</b> {{of a coalition}} on a player, where players have an ordered set of possible actions. Each player has an inclination to choose one of the actions. Due to influence of a coalition of other players, a final decision of the player may be different from his original inclination. An influence in such situations {{is measured by the}} general <b>weighted</b> influence <b>index.</b> In a particular case, the decision of the player may be closer to the inclination of the influencing coalition than his inclination was. The <b>weighted</b> influence <b>index</b> which captures such a case is called the positive <b>weighted</b> influence <b>index.</b> We also consider the negative <b>weighted</b> influence <b>index,</b> where a final decision of the player goes farther away from the inclination of the influencing coalition. Some special cases of the <b>weighted</b> influence <b>indices,</b> called a possibility influence index and an equidistributed influence index, are also defined. We consider different influence functions and study their properties. A set of followers and a set of a conditional followers of a given coalition are defined, and their properties are analyzed. We define the concepts of success, decisiveness, luck, and failure for the multi-choice model of influence...|$|R
