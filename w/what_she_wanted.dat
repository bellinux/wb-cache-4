5|$|New York City actress Ash ("Liz") Sroka voices Tali {{throughout}} the Mass Effect trilogy, her first {{role in a}} video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one other female character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted.</b> Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role.|$|E

25|$|As her {{children}} became adults, Victoria began to seek suitors for them. In 1878, Charlotte married her paternal second cousin Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, which delighted the Berlin court. Three years later, Victoria began negotiations to marry William to Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, provoking outrage in conservative German circles. Chancellor Bismarck criticised the project because the princess {{belonged to the}} family who was dethroned by Prussia with the annexation of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in 1864. As for the Hohenzollerns, they considered Augusta Victoria unworthy to marry the heir apparent to the German Empire because her family lacked sufficient rank. After several months of negotiations, Victoria got <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted,</b> but soon became disappointed when she saw that her daughter-in-law {{did not have the}} liberal personality that she expected.|$|E

25|$|In 1966 one of {{the city}} commissioners {{resigned}} his seat, possibly with the encouragement of Miami Mayor Robert King High. High was running for the Democratic Party nomination for Governor of Florida at the time. He appointed Athalie Range to fill the unexpired term of the commissioner who had resigned. In 1967 and again in 1969 Athalie Range was reelected to the City commission. While on the commission, Range sought to have garbage collection improved in black neighborhoods, which sometimes went three weeks between garbage pickups, while white neighborhoods got twice a week pickups. After a vote on her proposed ordinance to equalize garbage service was twice postponed, Range had her neighbors bring bags of garbage to the commission meeting and dump them on the commissioners' desks. After that the ordinance was passed. She also pressed for tighter gun controls, but was able to get only part of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted.</b> After a fire caused by a kerosene heater killed eleven people in a house in a black neighborhood, Range led an effort to have such heaters banned in Miami.Dunn.

25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she had always known <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to say, but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E

500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts.

[...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to say, where she wanted to be, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E
