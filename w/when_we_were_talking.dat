500|$|Joel Brind, {{a faculty}} member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary {{advocate}} of an abortionbreast cancer ("ABC") link. Brind is strongly anti-abortion and began lobbying politicians with the claim that abortion caused breast cancer in the early 1990s. Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: [...] "I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about the conclusions, he [...] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, J. August Richards, one of {{the stars}} of the earlier Joss Whedon series Angel, was cast in the pilot in an {{unspecified}} role, later revealed to be Mike Peterson, the first live-action portrayal of Deathlok and a recurring character throughout the season. Nicholas Brendon, another Whedon collaborator, was also reportedly considered for Richards' role. In December, two recurring characters were set to be added to the series with the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] They were described as [...] "an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons, and a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward." [...] In January 2014, Bill Paxton was cast as Agent John Garrett, [...] "a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger", for at least four episodes of the season. Jed Whedon said that [...] "We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about the character ... Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it." [...] The next month, B.J. Britt was cast as Agent Triplett, an associate of Garrett. Other recurring guests in the season include Saffron Burrows as Victoria Hand, David Conrad as Ian Quinn, and Ruth Negga as Raina.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Information {{protection}} {{is one of}} the most important issues in every domain, especially <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about enterprises. Information safety can be translated into three key terms: integrity, availability and data protection. There is a great number of means used in order to achieve the three objectives simultaneously. The most popular is cryptography because it offers a lot of techniques which nowadays are impossible to fail. In this paper we want to prove their efficiency by comparing the different types of crypto algorithms and by presenting their weaknesses and strengths. In order to maximize the benefits of the crypto techniques, we propose a hybrid approach that combines three crypto algorithms. I...|$|R
40|$|Do {{we really}} need {{boundaries}} between doctoral supervisor and supervisees <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about mature learners? Drawing on reflection from my extensive experience, I believe {{it is critical to}} maintain this divide. There is an increase in doctoral students, proliferation of doctoral programmes globally and practices which vary from context to context. A shared concern, however, is the engagement between the supervisor and the supervisee which can often be mutually unsatisfactory. Why is this relationship often so problematic for both parties? What kind of relationship is most appropriate and beneficial? To what extent does this academic engagement need rethinking? These questions are explored with reference to roles, expectations and boundaries and the underlying principles of good practice.  ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R
