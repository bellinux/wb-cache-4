5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird <b>warbling</b> when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical <b>warbling,</b> often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final <b>warbling</b> part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E
5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by <b>warbling</b> as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical <b>warbling,</b> often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} song have been described: the day song {{is the most}} common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an antiphonal duet, {{generally}} {{over the course of}} the day and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. The whisper song is sung more commonly in wet or windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree <b>warbling</b> soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the breeding song at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and more complex than the day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may chatter or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes.|$|E

50|$|No golden-winged warblers or blue-winged warblers were {{observed}} in Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 55 between 2011 and 2013. However, 14 species of warblers were there observed in May 1997. These warblers included the magnolia <b>warbler,</b> the yellow-rumped <b>warbler,</b> the Blackburnian <b>warbler,</b> the black-throated blue <b>warbler,</b> the black-throated green <b>warbler,</b> the hooded <b>warbler,</b> the cerulean <b>warbler,</b> and several others.

25|$|There {{are warning}} lights at {{pedestrian}} crossing {{points to the}} beach with a <b>warbling</b> siren to warn of the approach of a train. A following train is required to signal its approach to a pedestrian crossing point by sounding its klaxon horn. One such crossing provides the only external access to Halfway station.|$|E
25|$|The male's song {{consists}} of short pleasant <b>warbling</b> strophes, interspersed with fluid whistles. The individual phrases may go like tu-tu-krr-pree-pree or trr-turit trr-turit.... To announce {{that it has}} become aware of someone straying into its territory – be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal – it gives long shrill raspy whistles like trrii(u) or (t')kwiiet. To announce to females, it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song. A softer whistle goes like trüü(t). These whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season. Various contact calls have been described as chlie(p), gihrrr, kwä or wuut. These are frequently heard during courtship, interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre-courtship. The song becomes softer and more <b>warbling</b> as the male shows the female around his territory, and at potential nest sites the male gives a lively chatter containing fluting tli-tli, prrr trills and kwiw...püh calls.|$|E
25|$|Not every Gregorian chant fits {{neatly into}} Guido's hexachords {{or into the}} system of eight modes. For example, there are chants — {{especially}} from German sources – whose neumes suggest a <b>warbling</b> of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system, or in other words, employing a form of chromatism. Early Gregorian chant, like Ambrosian and Old Roman chant, whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, {{did not use the}} modal system. The great need for a system of organizing chants lies in the need to link antiphons with standard tones, as in for example, the psalmody at the Office. Using Psalm Tone i with an antiphon in Mode 1 makes for a smooth transition between the end of the antiphon and the intonation of the tone, and the ending of the tone can then be chosen to provide a smooth transition back to the antiphon. As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century Cistercian reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismata trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed. Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants — notably Communions — defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion Circuibo was transcribed using a different mode in each.|$|E

500|$|The great spotted kiwi is nocturnal in behaviour. If the kiwis {{live in an}} area lacking predators, {{they will}} {{come out in the}} day. At night, they come out to feed. Like other species of kiwi, they have a good sense of smell, which is unusual in birds. Males are {{fiercely}} territorial. At most, four to five kiwis live in a square kilometre. One pair's territory can be [...] in size. It is not known how they defend such a large territory in proportion to their size. They will call, chase, or fight intruders out. Vocalisations of the great spotted kiwi include growls, hisses, and bill snapping. Great spotted kiwi males have a call that resembles a <b>warbling</b> whistle, while the female call is harsh raspy, and also <b>warbling.</b>|$|E
500|$|Another {{call that}} does not fit into the two {{categories}} is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic [...] "waaaaah" [...] sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it {{is thought to be}} emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make <b>warbling</b> whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.|$|E
500|$|This {{species is}} {{one of a group of}} very similar typical {{treecreeper}} species, all placed in the single genus Certhia. Eight species are currently recognised, in two evolutionary lineages: a [...] Holarctic radiation, and a southern Asian group. The Holarctic group has a more <b>warbling</b> song, always (except in C. familiaris from China) starting or ending with a shrill sreeh. Species in the southern group, in contrast, have a faster-paced trill without the sreeh sound. All the species have distinctive vocalizations and some subspecies have been elevated to species on the basis of their calls.|$|E

500|$|Most {{house sparrow}} vocalisations are {{variations}} on its short and incessant chirping call. Transcribed as chirrup, tschilp, or philip, this note is {{made as a}} contact call by flocking or resting birds, or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing. In the breeding season, the male gives this call repetitively, with emphasis and speed, but not much rhythm, forming what is described either as a song or an [...] "ecstatic call" [...] similar to a song. Young birds also give a true song, especially in captivity, a <b>warbling</b> {{similar to that of}} the European greenfinch.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{compared}} Leavins to {{works by}} other R artists. Rogers wrote {{that it was}} a perfect fit for listeners of Joss Stone and Jamie Cullum Daniel Garrett of The Compulsive Reader listed the record alongside Ella Fitzgerald's The Best of the Song Books (1993) and Diana Ross' Blue (2006), praising each woman as the [...] "three ladies of song". Honolulu Star-Bulletin's Gary C.W. Chun favorably compared Leavin to Gladys Knight's Before Me (2006). Rogers wrote that Cole's vocal performance demonstrated a [...] "tasteful restraint" [...] and was an improvement over contemporary artists. He felt that Cole's voice was better than the [...] "modulated <b>warbling</b> that seems to pass for contemporary R these days".|$|E
500|$|The call {{is mostly}} uttered in flight {{and is a}} harsh [...] "tsak tsak tsuk". The same sound, but softer, is made more conversationally when {{individuals}} gather in trees.
