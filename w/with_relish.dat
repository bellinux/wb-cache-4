25|$|Favorite food plants include {{native and}} {{introduced}} species from {{all sorts of}} dicot families, such as Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae or Solanaceae. Magnoliidae fruit, for example of Duguetia furfuracea (Annonaceae) or avocados (Persea americana, Lauraceae) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat cereal grains, or monocots in general. However, the leaves of particular grass species like Brachiaria brizantha can be eaten in large quantities, and Liliaceae (e.g. the sarsaparilla Smilax brasiliensis) have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like tubers or thistles is eaten <b>with</b> <b>relish.</b> Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the greater rhea swallows pebbles which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.|$|E
25|$|A {{brilliant}} Commons performance {{made his}} career. On 27 March 1952, having been called {{fifth in the}} debate rather than third as originally scheduled, he spoke after former Health Minister Aneurin Bevan. Beginning his speech with the words “I wish to deal closely and <b>with</b> <b>relish</b> with the vulgar, crude and intemperate speech to which the House of Commons has just listened”, he attacked Bevan with facts and figures and commented that a health debate without Bevan would be like “Hamlet without the first gravedigger”. Churchill, who had been getting up to leave, stayed to listen and was heard to ask the Chief Whip, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, who the promising young backbencher was. When summoned to 10 Downing Street on 7 May {{he claimed to have}} been half-expecting a reprimand for his refusal to serve a second term as a British representative at the Council of Europe, a job he found boring, but he was instead appointed Minister of Health, which was not a Cabinet position at that time.|$|E

25|$|Apart from {{a passing}} mention by another (minor) author, the Annales by the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus (written ca. 98 AD) {{is the sole}} surviving ancient source on the Tacfarinas War. Tacitus gives a relatively detailed account, but its exclusivity {{makes it difficult to}} assess its accuracy and the war's significance. Tacitus was fascinated by the psychology of the emperor Tiberius, whom he regarded as the quintessential flawed tyrant, and the way that the long-drawn out insurgency in Africa with its many crises exposed his weaknesses. For example, the emperor's explosion of fury when he received envoys from Tacfarinas demanding concessions in return for peace. This was not only due to Tiberius' exasperation with the insurgency. Adding insult to injury, Tacfarinas was apparently a commoner by birth, an affront to the status-conscious Romans. To Tiberius, a scion of the illustrious Claudii patrician clan and ruler of a vast empire, it seemed intolerable that such a person should be seeking to deal with him on an equal basis, like a foreign king. Tacitus relates <b>with</b> <b>relish</b> Tiberius' feelings of personal humiliation.|$|E

Pacino played Satan in the supernatural thriller The Devil's Advocate (1997) which co-starred Keanu Reeves. The film was a success at the box office, taking US$150 million worldwide.

Calling it a [...] "teenager's delight", a publication on the park remarked on the selling of [...] "the most outrageous candles in the world—hot dogs <b>with</b> <b>relish,</b> banana split..." [...] Pizza was offered for $1 or less per slice, but the Toronto Star deemed the machine-stretched dough [...] "perhaps too cookie-like," [...] in spite of ample cheese and spicy sauce. The grape sherbet included both grape juice and real Italian wine. By 1989, La Casa remained, but Camicie and Maschera {{had been replaced by}} The Painted Shirt.|$|E
500|$|By early 1975, Nixon's {{health was}} improving. He {{maintained}} {{an office in}} a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs. He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; {{the fact that his}} assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly. He was handicapped in this work {{by the end of his}} transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler. In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (...) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977. They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had [...] "let down the country" [...] and that [...] "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it <b>with</b> <b>relish.</b> And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing." [...] The interviews garnered 45–50million viewers—becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.|$|E

500|$|Cruttwell's {{administrative}} competence was recognised in 1930, {{when he was}} elected principal of Hertford College. In this office, he helped to establish the university's geography school and arranged that the first Oxford professorship in geography was based at Hertford. During his tenure as principal, he completed his most significant academic works, including his Great War history (1934) which earned him the Oxford degree of DLitt. In 1936 Cruttwell delivered the Lees-Knowles Lecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the title [...] "The Role of British Strategy in the Great War". In the same year he published a biography of the Duke of Wellington and in 1937 produced his final major academic work, [...] A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World. An attempt in 1935 to emulate his grandfather and become one of the university's members of parliament failed when, as a Conservative candidate in the general election of 1935, Cruttwell was defeated. An Independent, A. P. Herbert, beat him on the third ballot in a single transferable vote system. This was {{the first time since the}} 1860s, that a Conservative had failed to hold either of the two university seats, a humiliation noted <b>with</b> <b>relish</b> by [...] Waugh who harboured a deep hostility towards his former tutor. According to The Times, Cruttwell had underestimated the nature and determination of the opposition and had taken his election as a Conservative for granted. In first preferences, he came bottom of the poll with only 1,803 votes, while his Conservative running mate, Lord Hugh Cecil, gained 7,365, almost five times as many. Because he polled less than one-eighth of the first ballot votes, Cruttwell forfeited his deposit.|$|E
500|$|A {{film that}} {{features}} {{the voices of}} several well-known A-list actors, namely Irons as Scar, Matthew Broderick as Simba, James Earl Jones as Mufasa and Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, The Lion King has since gone on to be acclaimed as [...] "one {{of the most impressive}} arrays of voice talents ever utilized in an animated film." [...] Critics have repeatedly singled out Irons' performance, praising it extensively: Cindy White of IGN called Irons' performance [...] "deliciously smarmy," [...] while Andy Patrizio of IGN wrote that Irons voices Scar [...] "in perfect Shakespearean villain mode." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers hailed Irons for [...] "deliver a triumphantly witty vocal performance that ranks with Robin Williams' in Aladdin." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle commended Disney for [...] "nail the voice talents," [...] specifically Irons. The Philadelphia Daily News Bill Wedo described Irons' voice as [...] "silken," [...] while Graham Young of the Birmingham Mail hailed the actor's performance as [...] "magnificent." [...] Radio Times Tom Hutchinson wrote, [...] "Jeremy Irons [...] a vocal standout as the evil uncle Scar." [...] Annette Basile of Filmink echoed Hutchinson's statement, writing that Scar is [...] "voiced <b>with</b> <b>relish</b> by stand-out Jeremy Irons." [...] The Guardians Philip French opined, [...] "Jeremy Irons is excellent as the suavely villainous lion Scar." [...] David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor exalted Irons' acting, describing him as [...] "positively brilliant." [...] Also hailing the film's cast as [...] "incredible," [...] Desson Howe of The Washington Post highlighted Irons as a [...] "standout." [...] Praising the film for successfully combining [...] "grand-opera melodrama and low-comedy hi-jinks," [...] the Orlando Sentinels Jay Boyar concluded that [...] "One reason they work so well together is that even most of the serious sections contain an undercurrent of humor, provided... by the deliciously droll voice-performance of Jeremy Irons as Scar."

2500|$|A {{recurring}} story concerns Jackson's love of lemons, {{which he}} allegedly gnawed whole to alleviate symptoms of dyspepsia. General Richard Taylor, son of President Zachary Taylor, wrote {{a passage in}} his war memoirs about Jackson eating lemons: [...] "Where Jackson got his lemons 'no fellow could find out,' but he was rarely without one." [...] However, recent research by his biographer, James I. Robertson, Jr., has found that none of Jackson's contemporaries, including members of his staff, his friends, or his wife, recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons. Jackson thought of a lemon as a [...] "rare treat ... enjoyed greatly whenever it could {{be obtained from the}} enemy's camp".

[...] Rothkopf praises Joon-ho, stating, [...] " [...] Bong grabs onto the grungy conventions of postapocalyptic adventure <b>with</b> <b>relish.</b> He serves up claustrophobic action scenes (one largely shot in the dark) and ominous, messianic overtones as the band of rebels makes its way forward." ...|$|E

[...] Rooney described the play as unexceptional, cursory and simple, despite its intelligent writing, engrossing and often funny dialogue and commented that: [...] "Brimming with testosterone and grit, it’s an unabashed celebration of male camaraderie, swaggering ambition and competitiveness." [...] Kumar, writing in The Independent, was disappointed in the play’s depth and Hanks’s acting, but thought that Courtney B.
