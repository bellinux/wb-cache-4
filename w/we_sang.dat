I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might {{have thought it was}} just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?... But all those songs <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] <b>We</b> <b>sang</b> 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
2500|$|Of course {{everything}} {{depends on}} the repertoire which is quite large – more than two thousand works. Depending on the concert we choose a special repertoire. We have a rule that {{we try not to}} break. In any country we sing 2–3 songs in the native language {{of the people who live}} there. As a rule it helps to find a rapport with, and the appreciation of, the audience. And for us it is some kind of musical gift, to honour the host country and its people. For instance in Canada when <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> the National Anthem of Russia people stood up to show respect to our country, and when we finished <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> their country's anthem Oh, Canada!.|$|E

6000|$|Yet thus {{much choice}} in <b>singing</b> is; [...] <b>We</b> <b>sing</b> the good, the true, the just, [...] Passionate duty turned to bliss, [...] And honour {{growing out of}} trust. [...] Freedom <b>we</b> <b>sing,</b> and would not lose [...] Her lightest {{footprint}} in life's dust. [...] <b>We</b> <b>sing</b> of her because we choose, [...] <b>We</b> <b>sing</b> of love because we must.|$|R

2500|$|Sermons {{were long}} and harrowing. [...] In vivid language, the preacher painted Heaven and Hell, with {{considerably}} more emphasis on Hell than upon Heaven. [...] I mentally pictured the Devil as a monstrous red animal with horns and a long tail, who carried a four-pronged pitchfork. [...] For some reason, I believed {{he lived in the}} ground and could appear at will. [...] The church had no organ or piano, so <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> without instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Brandy also names her father, vocal coach Willie Norwood, as {{instrumental}} to her {{discovery and}} {{development as a}} musician. She exclaims that her dad “taught me everything that I know ”. About her dad, Brandy states: “I grew up singing in church with my dad, {{where he was the}} musical director and <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> gospel songs in acapella almost exclusively. He bought me my first 4-track tape recorder. At first, I didn’t like my own voice, but he encouraged me to embrace the unique qualities of my voice.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his earlier}} years, {{at least from}} the 1960s to the 1980s, Guthrie had taken a decidedly leftist {{approach}} to American politics. [...] In his often lengthy comments during concerts his expressed positions were consistently anti-war, anti-Nixon, pro-drugs and in favor of making nuclear power illegal. [...] However, he apparently regarded himself as more an individualist than the major youth culture spokesperson he had been regarded as by the media, as evidenced by the lyrics in his 1979 song [...] "Prologue": [...] "I can remember all of your smiles during the demonstrations, ... and together <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> our victory songs though we were worlds apart." [...] A 1969 rewrite of [...] "Alice's Restaurant" [...] pokes fun at then-former President Lyndon Johnson and his staff.|$|E

2500|$|She {{performed}} in local cafes and events {{as well as}} with a cover band, Chrome, with [...] "three of my best friends". At that time [...] "We thought that The Donnas and Karen O from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the ultimate women of the world". Her varied inspirations include Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens and Neil Young, which her father favoured as she was growing up, as well as Patti Smith, Regina Spektor, Clare Bowditch, Joanna Newsom, and later, Lou Reed and Velvet Underground. Mitchell also formed a duo with another Albury-based friend, Katherine Green, which was [...] "More along the lines of what I do on my own now, only a lot folkier. <b>We</b> <b>sang</b> [...] colonial folk tunes actually. Quite traditional and harmony based. We had brilliant fun playing in the chalkboard tents at the folk festivals in Australia". Mitchell was later based in Sydney, London and then Melbourne.|$|E
2500|$|This {{combination}} of size, weight, range and agility {{was a source}} of amazement to Callas's own contemporaries. One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in I vespri siciliani recalled, [...] "My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto, Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over, she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte's!" [...] In the same vein, mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: [...] "The first time <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> together was in Mexico in 1950, where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of Aida. I can still remember the effect of that note in the opera house—it was like a star!" [...] For Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi, [...] "the most fantastic thing was the possibility for her to sing the soprano coloratura with this [...] voice! This was something really special. [...] absolutely!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was five}} feet nine {{inches tall and}} was always very slender so that he {{appeared}} taller than he was actually…he had been a gymnast and the muscles of his arms and back stood out like ropes. [...] He was soft spoke and agreeable, yet, {{there was always a}} certain reserve. He was modest, honest, and true. He spoke well of others. As a boy he had gone to church twice on Sundays, once in the morning and once in the evening. He visited the sick and aged. [...] He loved games. He was an avid hunter and fisherman. [...] He was first a cavalryman before he became a flyer and he enjoyed riding and polo. In San Antonio, he had three polo ponies. I was never allowed to ride them, presumably because I would spoil them. He did, however, teach me to ride other horses, to swim, to golf, and to play baseball. [...] He enjoyed music and <b>we</b> <b>sang</b> on long automobile trips when he changed station from one Army post to another, my father and mother in the front seat and my sister, Barbara, and I in the back. [...] His posture was firmly erect and he possessed a cold courage that was remarkable. Beneath the calm exterior lay the competitiveness and combativeness fostered by the severe training at West Point.|$|E
