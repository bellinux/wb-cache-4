5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and {{saying that it is}} their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> close the portal centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia.

5|$|During {{his tour}} of New Japan in late August and early September, he started {{competing}} again as his Prince Devitt identity, utilizing an Irish superstar gimmick. He eventually turned heel and started teaming with the Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) in an apprenticetype role. While teaming with CTU, {{he began a}} losing streak, aggravating his teammates {{to such a degree}} that they did not want anything to do with him anymore. This led to him being given one final chance on 6 October, where he rose to the occasion and impressed his CTU teammates enough to continue his association with them. To solidify his status with the stable, Devitt teamed with CTU leader, Jushin Thunder Liger to take on Wataru Inoue and Ryusuke Taguchi. In a huge twist, Devitt <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> make the final cover on Inoue following a stiff brainbuster. From then on he was officially recognized as a member of the CTU.|$|E

5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Jones {{surveyed}} the lakeshore of townships east from York, Upper Canada, to the Trent River, from the lakeshore to {{a distance of}} one mile (1.6km) from Lake Ontario. Jones and his team had set out from Scarborough to the eastern boundary of the Nassau District, the approximate area of {{the mouth of the}} Trent River. From there, they began surveying townships along Lake Ontario travelling westwards. They surveyed in turn Murray Township, then Cramahe Township, Haldimand Township, Hamilton Township, Hope Township, Clarke Township, Darlington Township, Pickering Township, Glasgow Township, York Township and Etobicoke Township. Sideroads were then run north to the first concession road. Clarke township had previously been unnamed, Jones <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> name it. The survey of the west end of the Nassau district finalised the boundary of the Toronto Purchase, which had been agreed upon in principle, but could not be completed because the land areas involved were not well known. On June 13, 1792 Jones submitted a town plan for Newark, Upper Canada to the Land Board.|$|E
5|$|The day's battle {{began on}} 18 June 1815 at about 11a.m. with a French attack on Hougoumont from the south-west, led by Napoleon's brother Jerome. The French {{gained control of}} much of the chateau's park, but the Allies {{retained}} possession of the farmhouse and courtyard surrounds. Jerome continued his attempts to take the farmhouse throughout the day, making four or five assaults, most of which were repulsed by the defenders, who fired through loopholes, windows, and doorways. One assault at about 12.30p.m. breached the north gate, which had been left open to allow allied troop and supply movements. Sous-Lieutenant Legro, of the French 1st Light Infantry, broke through the wooden doors with an axe, allowing French soldiers to flood the courtyard. Graham's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonnell, led his men through the melee in the courtyard to the gates, in an attempt to shut them against the pressing French. This was done with the help of three officers (Captain Wyndham, Ensign Hervey, and Ensign Gooch), Corporal Graham, and a few other soldiers including Graham's brother Joseph. James Graham <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> slot the bar in place. Flagstones, carts, and debris were then piled against the gates to hold them secure. The Frenchmen trapped within the courtyard were all killed, apart from a young drummer-boy.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} grand Shakespeare edition was {{conceived}} at a dinner at Josiah Boydell’s home in November 1786.

Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby. Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell's, he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> seize and pursue it. He {{wanted to use the}} edition to facilitate the development of a British school of history painting.|$|E
