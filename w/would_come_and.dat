5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
25|$|Al-Maqrizi notes, that Khufu {{was named}} Saurid, Salhuk and/or Sarjak by the biblical Amalekites. Then he writes, that Khufu built the pyramids after repeating nightmares, {{in which the}} earth turned upside-down, the stars fell down and people were {{screaming}} in terror. Another nightmare showed the stars falling down from heaven and kidnapping humans, then putting these beneath two large mountains. King Khufu then received a warning from his prophets about a devastating deluge, that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> destroy Egypt. To protect his treasures and books of wisdom, Khufu built the three pyramids of Giza.|$|E
25|$|At {{certain times}} {{according}} to the Muisca calendar, the people organised bigger markets during their festivities where people from farther away <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> trade their products. One {{of the most important}} of those ferias were held close to the banks of the Magdalena River, {{to the west of the}} Muisca territories in Panche and Muzo terrains. Here, gold and tropical fruits as avocadoes, guayabas, ice cream beans, star apples and various members (guanabana, chirimoya and others) of the Annona family were obtained, traded for mantles, emeralds and salt. Other big festivity markets were organised in Coyaima, on the banks of the Saldaña River and close to Neiva, area of the Pijao.|$|E

25|$|Nomura's father {{influenced}} {{his interest}} in art and games early on, creating little drawings and unique Sugoroku board games for him. Nomura started drawing {{at the age of}} three years and developed his own Sugoroku games during his elementary school years. As a child, he spent much of his free time playing baseball, swimming, fishing and building fortresses. When he was in middle school, his father told him that an era of computers <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> bought him his own computer. Nomura played Legends of Star Arthur: Planet Mephius on it and started creating his own video games by learning programming. He first tried a Nintendo product with the tennis and ping-pong variant of the Color TV Game console and later borrowed a Family Computer in high school. Around that time, Dragon Warrior became Nomura's favorite because it surprised him and introduced him to video games with story elements. His art teacher in high school pointed him towards the works of Final Fantasy illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. Nomura also created his own manga during class and intended to do this as a profession although he ultimately abandoned the idea. Nomura went to vocational school to learn magazine and advertising artwork. Nomura then looked for an advertising job at a publishing company. However, he eventually applied at the video game company Square after he had seen a job advertisement with a drawing by Yoshitaka Amano.|$|E
500|$|In 1721, British sailors of the East India Company were {{reported}} to be playing cricket at Cambay, near Baroda, {{and this is the}} earliest reference to cricket being played in the Indian sub-continent. One of the players wrote: [...] "When my boat was lying for a fortnight in one of the channels, though the country was inhabited by the Culeys (sic), we every day diverted ourselves with playing Cricket and to other Exercises, which they <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> be spectators of".|$|E
500|$|Hayden, {{while not}} the only person to have thought of {{creating}} a park in the region, was its first and most enthusiastic advocate. He believed in [...] "setting aside the area as a pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people" [...] and warned that there were those who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> [...] "make merchandise of these beautiful specimens". Worrying the area could face the same fate as Niagara Falls, he concluded the site should [...] "be as free as the air or Water." [...] In his report to the Committee on Public Lands, he concluded that if the bill failed to become law, [...] "the vandals who are now waiting to enter into this wonder-land, will in a single season despoil, beyond recovery, these remarkable curiosities, which have required all the cunning skill of nature thousands of years to prepare".|$|E

500|$|Scandal erupted when {{founding}} principal Dickinson {{resigned in}} 1991, citing health reasons, while {{under investigation for}} alleged improper contact with students off school grounds; no charges were ever filed. He was succeeded by Dr. Rosalyn England, former principal of Central VPA High School in St. Louis. Controversy continued and between 1992 and 1995, two teachers confessed to having or attempting {{to have sex with}} students and two more were investigated for allegations of sexual misconduct. In 1992, open conflict with England led to the departure of original Artistic Director Jack Louiso, whom Dickinson had called [...] "the 'life-blood' of the school's artistic endeavors". The artistic program would remain in upheaval; four more artistic directors <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go under England. The controversies took a toll; applications suffered, teachers departed, financial support dwindled {{and the quality of the}} productions declined. By 1996, enrollment had fallen from nearly 1,200 to 956.|$|E

So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't {{want to get their}} own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it." [...] The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, Machete Kills (2013), followed.|$|E

Fiasco is of West African descent, {{one of nine}} {{children}} of Shirley, a gourmet chef, and Gregory, an engineer.

Fiasco was raised Muslim on the West Side of Chicago on Madison Terrace housing project. [...] At the age of three, Fiasco began taking martial arts classes. His parents divorced when he was five, and he went on to live with his mother, but his father still remained an important part of his life. He described his father's influence over the family by saying, [...] "After school, my father <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> get us and take us out into the world—one day, we're listening to N.W.A, the next day we're listening to Ravi Shankar, the next day, he's teaching us how to shoot an AK-47, the next day, we're at karate class, the next day, we're in Chinatown...".|$|E

500|$|On the road, two ZIPRA BTR-152s from Essexvale {{advanced}} towards Bulawayo, firing indiscriminately in all directions, {{and were}} spotted by Devine around 01:30. The Elands {{waited in the}} darkness until the ZIPRA vehicles were about [...] away, then fired. Both APCs were directly hit {{and most of the}} men inside killed; the survivors ran off into the night. Fleetwood then arrived {{at the head of a}} 1RAR platoon to support Devine and Husher. Around the same time, men of A Company, 1RAR captured a ZIPRA commander who was trying to enter Bulawayo through a back road in a Peugeot station wagon, and 3Platoon, A Company captured six ZIPRA officers driving into town on the Essexvale Road in a Toyota Land Cruiser. McKenna ordered Hill and D Company to help Dyck by taking up a position between the city and Entumbane. A group of ZIPRA unsuccessfully attacked D Company as it moved west to high ground at Lurkers' Ridge, just south-east of the Alamo.

500|$|The {{character}} Astronaut Mike Dexter was referenced in this episode, {{in which}} Liz tells the dental receptionist {{that she did}} not sign the liability waiver as her [...] "boyfriend" [...] Mike Dexter <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> take her home. Liz considers the character to be her imaginary perfect husband. The character was first introduced in [...] "Sun Tea", in which [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) pretended to be Mike Dexter, Liz's [...] "crazy black boyfriend", after she planned to get her roommate out of his apartment with Dot Com's help, but her plan backfired. In [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show", Liz's imagination of Mike Dexter was played by actor John Anderson, in a scene where Liz fantasizes about what her life would be like following the success of her talk show, and is then notified by Mike Dexter that he has to go back to outer space. Astronaut Mike Dexter would be mentioned further in the season, but near its end Liz decides her infatuation with him is pathetic and [...] "breaks up" [...] with him in a dream; along with her S4 finale meeting of a pilot played by Matt Damon and her brusque breakup with and dismissal of an annoying anti-love interest played by Michael Sheen; this sets the stage for Liz Lemon to be portrayed as much less of a loser from Season 5 through the series finale.|$|E
500|$|Yuichi is accosted a {{few days}} after {{arriving}} in the city by Kanons third heroine Makoto Sawatari, a young girl who has lost her memories, but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.Translated quote: [...] "If only spring <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> stay forever." [...] Yuichi coincidentally runs into Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in Kanon is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she [...] "punishes" [...] someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head.|$|E

500|$|Owing to the {{suppression}} by Serbia of Apis's confession {{and of the}} Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. [...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E

Seeing this, God said that the people had acted improperly, so God would deal with them improperly (in a way that they would not relish).|$|E
