5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>and</b> what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E

They also suffer from the general sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death. Yet the human realm {{is considered to be}} the most suitable realm for practicing the dharma, because humans are not completely distracted by pleasure (like the gods or demi-gods) or by pain and suffering (like the beings in the lower realms).|$|E
25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>and</b> where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E

25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product {{they are looking}} for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

He can read people quickly, understanding <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> can tell who has power, but is waiting for a moment when he can take it for himself because he enjoys having power.

2500|$|To an extent, Mahagonny is {{an opera}} that satirizes operas. Brecht said that [...] "t attacks {{the society that}} needs operas of such a sort" [...] and Weill said that it [...] "pays {{conscious}} tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form". Both thought operas had become too full of ritual and bereft of substance, and Mahagonny in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the deus ex machina tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free to do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around like giant slabs of meat and the [...] "love" [...] is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The [...] "Mandalay Song" [...] also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about the whole business. In Mahagonny, operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.|$|E
