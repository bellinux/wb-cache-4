Volatile organic compounds (VOC) in exhaled air are released during inflammation in response to oxidative stress {{as a result of}} activated leukocytes. VOC profiles in exhaled air could distinguish between asthma patients and healthy subjects. In this study, <b>we</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> new asthma endotypes by combining inflammatory mechanisms investigated by VOC profiles in exhaled air and clinical information of asthma patients. MethodsBreath samples were analyzed for VOC profiles by gas chromatography¿mass spectrometry from asthma patients (n¿=¿ 195) and healthy controls (n¿=¿ 40). A total of 945 determined compounds were subjected to discriminant analysis to find those that could discriminate healthy from asthmatic subjects. 2 -step cluster analysis based on clinical information and VOCs in exhaled air were used to form asthma endotypes. ResultsWe identified 16 VOCs, which could distinguish between healthy and asthma subjects with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 91. 1 %. Cluster analysis based on VOCs in exhaled air and the clinical parameters FEV 1, FEV 1 change after 3  weeks of hospitalization, allergic sensitization, Junipers symptoms score and asthma medications resulted in the formation of 7 different asthma endotype clusters. We identified asthma clusters with different VOC profiles but similar clinical characteristics and endotypes with similar VOC profiles, but distinct clinical characteristics.

First, baseline clinical status with age and Charlson index. Second, primary care practice style with mean delay between consultations, quantity of nursing care, and variability of diuretic dose. Third, clinical outcomes with death during follow-up, readmission for HF, and rate of unforeseen consultations. The baseline clinical status and the clinical outcomes were included to give an insight in the reasons for, and performance of, primary care practice style. Patients were classified using a hierarchical ascending classification based on principal components. A total of 2, 751 patients were {{included in this study}} and were followed for a median of 22 months. The mean age was 78 y (SD: 12); 484 (18 %) died, and 818 (30 %) were readmitted for HF.

An improved understanding of this breathing disorder is essential since nocturnal stridor carries a poor prognosis (an increased risk of sudden death). In this study, <b>we</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> types of stridor by sound analysis and to reveal their clinical significance. Patients who met the criteria for probable MSA and had undergone polysomnography (PSG) were recruited. Patients were then assessed clinically with sleep questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Nocturnal stridor and snoring were analyzed with the Multi-Dimensional Voice Program. Nocturnal stridor was recorded in 22 patients and snoring in 18 patients using the PSG. Waveforms of stridors were classified into rhythmic or semirhythmic after analysis of the oscillogram. Formants and harmonics were observed in both types of stridor, but not in snoring. Of the 22 patients diagnosed with stridor during the present study, fifteen have subsequently died, with the time to death after the PSG study being 1. 9 ± 1. 4 years (range 0. 8 to 5. 0 years). The rhythmic waveform group presented {{higher scores on the}} Hoehn and Yahr scale and the survival outcome of this group was lower compared to the semirhythmic waveform group (p = 0. 030, p = 0. 014). In the Kaplan Meier's survival curve, the outcome of patients with rhythmic waveform was significantly less favorable than the outcome of patients with semirhythmic waveform (log-rank test, p < 0. 001).

However, in the literature, few studies have evaluated the frequency of delirium in hospitalized patients, including those older than 65 years. According to our knowledge, this is the first study on adult patients in all age groups in an emergency department. <b>We</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> delirium according <b>to</b> its etiological causes and to compare the age groups for frequency and these causes. Material and Methods: Forty-three patients were included in the study; they had been diagnosed with delirium according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -IV in an emergency department from December 2002 to December 2003. The patients were divided into two groups (group I: age < 65 years, group II: age ≥ 65 years). Following a detailed history, each patient underwent a physical and neurological examination. Additionally, the Mini-Mental State Examination was administered. Radiological and hematological examinations were conducted on all patients who had indications for such testing. Results: Of the patients with delirium, 18 were female and 25 were male. Mean age was 61. 18 years (range 18 to 90 years). Of the 43 patients, 21 were in group I and 22 were in group II. The most common causes of delirium were metabolic disorders. There {{was no significant difference between}} group I and II for the frequency or etiological causes of delirium.

40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{performed}} a prospective arthroscopic study {{to explore the}} variability of the posterior labrum glenoid insertion. <b>We</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> the insertions and to explore whether these insertions can be identified by pre-operative arthro-CT scan. Patients and methodsFrom January to December 2011, 86  patients were prospectively included in the current study. During arthroscopy, anterior labrum was evaluated and posterior labrum was assessed in 3 different locations: superior, medial, and inferior. For each segment, the labrum was considered normally inserted (directly to the glenoid cartilage), medialized (inserted at the posterior part of the glenoid bone, without {{direct contact with the}} cartilage), torn (macroscopic degenerative changes, tears, fragments) or absent (agenesis). Imaging was analyzed segment by segment by an experienced osteoarticular radiologist, using the same classification. ResultsFour types of posterior labrum insertions were identified. Type 1, 60 % of the cases, corresponded to a posterior labrum totally inserted in the glenoid, with direct contact with the cartilage. Type 2, 20 % of the cases, represented medialized insertion of the superior segment. Type 3, 15 % of the cases, represented an associated medialization of the superior and medial segment of the posterior labrum. Type 4 is a medialized insertion of the all-posterior labrum. Fifty-six shoulders were used for arthro-CT and arthroscopy correlation: for the superior segment (n= 22 / 56), the sensitivity of arthro-CT to identify an abnormal insertion when the labrum is medialized was 68. 18 %, specificity 70. 59 %, positive predictive value (PPV) 60 %, and negative predictive value (NPV) 77. 42 %. For the medial segment (n= 16 / 56), the sensitivity of arthro-CT to identify an abnormal insertion when the labrum is medialized was 81. 25 %, specificity 57. 50 %, PPV 43. 33 % and NPV 88. 46 %. For the inferior segment (n= 5 / 56), the sensitivity was 100 %, specificity 47. 60 %, PPV 15. 63 % and NPV 100 %. ConclusionThe current study points out the high variability of shoulder posterior labrum glenoid insertion, and thus the risk of misdiagnosis with posterior labral tears, especially in posterior instability and also the risk of considering as labral lesions some non-pathological aspects.

Prospective multicenter cohort study. Using a multistate approach we estimated 3 transition probabilities: from alive and NAE-free to alive and NAE-experienced ("NAE development"); from alive and NAE-experienced to death ("Death after NAE"); and from alive and NAE-free to death ("Death without NAE"). We analyzed the effect of different covariates, including demographic, immunologic and virologic data, on death or NAE development, based on estimates of hazard ratios (HR). We focused on the transition "Death after NAE". 8, 789 PLWH were followed-up until death, cohort censoring or loss to follow-up. 792 first incident NAEs occurred in 9. 01 % PLWH (incidence rate 28. 76; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 26. 80 - 30. 84, per 1000 patient-years). 112 (14. 14 %) NAE-experienced PLWH and 240 (2. 73 %) NAE-free PLWH died. Adjusted HR for the transition "Death after NAE" was 12. 1 (95 %CI, 4. 90 - 29. 89). There was a graded increase in the adjusted HRs for mortality according to NAE severity category: HR (95 %CI), 4. 02 (2. 45 - 6. 57) for intermediate-severity; and 9. 85 (5. 45 - 17. 81) for serious NAEs compared to low-severity NAEs. Male sex (HR 2. 04; 95 % CI, 1. 11 - 3. 84), age> 50 years (1. 78, 1. 08 - 2. 94), hepatitis C-coinfection (2. 52, 1. 38 - 4. 61), lower CD 4 cell count at cohort entry (HR 2. 49; 95 %CI 1. 20 - 5. 14 for CD 4 cell count below 200 and HR 2. 16; 95 %CI 1. 01 - 4. 66 for CD 4 cell count between 200 - 350, both compared to CD 4 cell count higher than 500) and concomitant CD 4 < 200 cells/mL (2. 22, 1. 42 - 3. 44) were associated with death after NAE. CD 4 count and HIV- 1 RNA at engagement, previous AIDS and hepatitis C-coinfection predicted mortality in NAE-free persons.

However, some of the patients presenting with symptoms of chronic airway diseases have clinical features of both asthma and COPD. The group with “Asthma–COPD Overlap Syndrome” (ACOS) phenotype was characterized by definitely irreversible airway obstruction accompanied by symptoms and signs of reversibility. In this study, <b>we</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> obstructive airway diseases by clinical, radiological, and pulmonary function tests. Patients at Samsun Medical Park Hospital Chest Diseases outpatient clinic were evaluated between January 2013 and April 2016, {{and a total of}} 235 patients were included in this study. Mean age of the patients was 55. 3 ± 14. 5 (15 – 88)  years, and the male/female ratio was 45 / 190. The baseline pulmonary function test results of the patients were as follows: mean forced vital capacity (FVC) values 2, 825 ± 1, 108 (710 – 6, 870)  mL and 74. 3 ± 22. 4 (24 – 155) %, forced expiratory volume in 1  second (FEV 1) values 1, 789 ± 774 (480 – 4, 810)  mL and 58. 1 ± 20. 0 (20 – 130) %, FEV 1 /FVC values 62. 5 ± 6. 8 (39 – 70) %. Reversibility criteria following bronchodilator treatment were present in 107 (45. 5 %) patients. We specified five subgroups for patients according to their clinical, radiological, and pulmonary test findings, namely Group 1 (asthma), Group 2 (ACOS), Group 3 (chronic bronchitis), and Group 4 (emphysema). Additionally, a group of patients who had clinical and spirometric features of both asthma and chronic bronchitis in association with underlying emphysema (emphysema with chronic bronchitis and emphysema with asthma) was defined as the undifferentiated obstruction (UNDO) group. Number and percentage distribution of patients by groups were 58 (24. 7 %) in the asthma group, 70 (29. 8 %) in the ACOS group, 61 (26 %) in the chronic bronchitis group, 32 (13. 6 %) in the emphysema group, and 14 (6 %) in the UNDO group. In conclusion, in our study, the types of obstructive airway diseases could be classified based on clinical, radiological, and pulmonary function test findings into five groups, including asthma, ACOS, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and both asthma and chronic bronchitis in association with underlying emphysema (emphysema with chronic bronchitis and emphysema with asthma) or the so-called undifferentiated obstruction. We suggest that these patient groups can be determined more accurately by studies that evaluate the association between spirometric FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC values, and reversibility ratios.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{emergency}} {{physician in}} charge role has developed in many large EDs {{to assist with}} patient flow. <b>We</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> describe and <b>classify</b> the problem-solving actions that this role requires. METHODS: We interviewed senior emergency physicians and performed iterative, qualitative observations, using continuous reflective inquiry, in a single centre. We reviewed and classified these approaches by consensus. RESULTS: Nine different problem-solving approaches were identified. These are deflecting, front loading, placing, plucking, flooding, targeting, chasing, guiding and juggling. These are useful for training and developing {{our understanding of how}} to manage an ED. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency physicians in charge have a number of problem-solving approaches that can be readily defined. We have described and categorised these. These results are potentially useful for developing decision support software. This work was funded by Cambridge University Health Partners and Cambridge University Hospitals Foundation Trust. The research was also part funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care East of England (CLAHRC EoE) at Cambridge and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Blinding is a {{cornerstone}} of therapeutic evaluation because lack of blinding can bias treatment effect estimates. An inventory of the blinding methods would help trialists conduct high-quality clinical trials and readers appraise the quality of results of published trials. <b>We</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> systematically <b>classify</b> and describe methods {{to establish and maintain}} blinding of patients and health care providers and methods to obtain blinding of outcome assessors in randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatments. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook a systematic review of all reports of randomized controlled trials assessing pharmacologic treatments with blinding published in 2004 in high impact-factor journals from Medline and the Cochrane Methodology Register. We used a standardized data collection form to extract data. The blinding methods were <b>classified</b> according <b>to</b> whether they primarily (1) established blinding of patients or health care providers, (2) maintained the blinding of patients or health care providers, and (3) obtained blinding of assessors of the main outcomes. We identified 819 articles, with 472 (58 %) describing the method of blinding. Methods to establish blinding of patients and/or health care providers concerned mainly treatments provided in identical form, specific methods to mask some characteristics of the treatments (e. g., added flavor or opaque coverage), or use of double dummy procedures or simulation of an injection. Methods to avoid unblinding of patients and/or health care providers involved use of active placebo, centralized assessment of side effects, patients informed only in part about the potential side effects of each treatment, centralized adapted dosage, or provision of sham results of complementary investigations. The methods reported for blinding outcome assessors mainly relied on a centralized assessment of complementary investigations, clinical examination (i. e., use of video, audiotape, or photography), or adjudication of clinical events. CONCLUSIONS: This review classifies blinding methods and provides a detailed description of methods that could help trialists overcome some barriers to blinding in clinical trials and readers interpret the quality of pharmacologic trials...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{and sleep}} loss are {{typically}} associated with psychomotor and cognitive impairment resulting in poorer task performance. Most of these studies are conducted in controlled settings and involve the completion of experimental tasks. Only a few field studies involving exhausted residents have been conducted over the past decade, and they yielded to contradictory results (Ellman et al., 2004). One of the key factors that could {{be involved in the}} non-linear relationship between fatigue and performance in specific work context reside in the mobilization of Fatigue Proofing Strategies. FPS are adaptive and protective risk-reduction behaviors that improve the resilience of a system of work (Dawson et al., 2012). In this study, <b>we</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> identify and <b>classify</b> proofing strategies mobilized by EMS residents using an inductive content analysis approach. EMS residents reported a range of strategies for reducing subjective level of sleepiness (reduction strategies, n= 15) or managing its consequences (proofing strategies, n= 17). Content analysis yielded to three sub-categories of proofing strategies: Behavioral Compensation (n= 8), Error’s Opportunity Reduction (n= 5) and Error’s Consequences Mitigation (n= 4). Our results show that EMS residents use both types of strategies although none of the proofing strategies were part of their training program. Despite the current informal use, there is significant potential for implementation of more formal processes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Microblog, {{especially}} Twitter {{today has}} become an important tool to propagate public information among Internet users. The content of Twitter is an extraordinarily large number of small textual messages, posted by millions of users, at random or in response to perceived events or situations. However, messages of Twitter (tweets) cover so many categories including news, spam and others that it's difficult to provide public information directly. Since the traditional search cannot meet demands of tweets of some category, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> tweets automatically into defined categories to help users search. In our paper, we focus on approaches of collecting a corpus automatically for training classifiers. We proposed two approaches {{that are based on}} typical Twitter user accounts and based on Twitter lists using label propagation respectively. Using the corpora, we built classifiers, which are able to determine news, commercial and private tweets. Experiments evaluations show our proposed techniques are effective. In our search, we worked with Japanese, but the proposed approaches can be used with any other language. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(情報理工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} Scottish Independence Referendum (hereafter, IndyRef), Twitter offered a broad {{platform}} {{for people to}} express their opinions, with millions of IndyRef tweets posted over the campaign period. In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> people's voting intentions by {{the content of their}} tweets [...] -their short messages communicated on Twitter. By observing tweets related to the IndyRef, we find that people not only discussed the vote, but raised topics related to an independent Scotland including oil reserves, currency, nuclear weapons, and national debt. We show that the views communicated on these topics can inform us of the individuals' voting intentions ("Yes" [...] in favour of Independence vs. "No" [...] Opposed). In particular, we argue that an accurate classifier can be designed by leveraging the differences in the features' usage across different topics related to voting intentions. We demonstrate improvements upon a Naive Bayesian classifier using the topics enrichment method. Our new classifier identifies the closest topic for each unseen tweet, based on those topics identified in the training data. Our experiments show that our Topics-Based Naive Bayesian classifier improves accuracy by 7. 8 % over the classical Naive Bayesian baseline...|$|E
40|$|Jaundice is a {{very common}} symptom {{especially}} in the developing countries. It is associated with several hepatic diseases which are still major causes of death. There are many different approaches to jaundice treatment and {{the growing number of}} ethnomedicinal studies shows the plant pharmacology as very promising direction. Many medicinal plants are used for the treatment of jaundice, however a comprehensive review on this subject has not been published. The use of medicinal plants in drug discovery is highly emphasized (based on their traditional and safe uses in different folk medicine systems from ancient times). Many sophisticated analytical techniques are emerging in the pharmaceutical field to validate and discover new biologically active chemical entities derived from plants. Here, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>classify</b> and categorize medicinal plants relevant for the treatment of jaundice according to their origin, geographical location, and usage. Our search included various databases like Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar. Keywords and phrases used for these searches included: “jaundice,” “hyperbilirubinemia,” “serum glutamate,” “bilirubin,” “Ayurveda. ” The first part of the review focuses on the variety of medicinal plant used for the treatment of jaundice (a total of 207 medicinal plants). In the second part, possible mechanisms of action of biologically active secondary metabolites of plants from five families for jaundice treatment are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) {{of chicken}} and other avian {{species have been}} studied {{primarily}} with microsomes or characterized by cloning and protein expression. However, the overall existing isoforms in avian CYP 1 - 3 families or dominant isoforms in avian xenobiotic metabolism {{have not yet been}} elucidated. In this study, <b>we</b> <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> clarify and <b>classify</b> all of the existing isoforms of CYP 1 - 3 in avian species using available genome assemblies for chicken, zebra finch, and turkey. Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR assay to identify dominant CYP genes in chicken liver. Our results suggested that avian xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP genes have undergone unique evolution such as CYP 2 C and CYP 3 A genes, which have undergone avian-specific gene duplications. qRT-PCR experiments showed that CYP 2 C 45 was the most highly expressed isoform in chicken liver, while CYP 2 C 23 b was the most highly induced gene by phenobarbital. Considering together with the result of further enzymatic characterization, CYP 2 C 45 may have a dominant role in chicken xenobiotic metabolism due to the constitutive high expression levels, while CYP 2 C 23 a and CYP 2 C 23 b can be greatly induced by chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR) activators. These findings will provide not only novel insights into avian xenobiotic metabolism, but also a basis for the further characterization of each CYP gene...|$|R
40|$|Context: Architecture-centric {{software}} evolution (ACSE) enables {{changes in}} system’s structure and behaviour {{while maintaining a}} global view of the software to address evolution-centric trade-offs. The existing research and practices for ACSE primarily focus on design-time evolution and runtime adaptations to accommodate changing requirements in existing architectures. Objectives: <b>We</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> identify, taxonomically <b>classify</b> and systematically compare the existing research focused on enabling or enhancing change reuse to support ACSE. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 32 qualitatively selected studies, and taxonomically classified these studies based on solutions that enable i) empirical acquisition and ii) systematic application of architecture evolution-reuse knowledge to guide ACSE. Results: We identified six distinct research themes that support acquisition and application of architecture evolution-reuse knowledge. We investigated: a) how evolution-reuse knowledge is defined, classified and represented in the existing research to support ACSE, b) what are the existing methods, techniques, and solutions to support: b) empirical acquisition and c) systematic application of architecture evolution-reuse knowledge. Conclusions: Change patterns (34 % of selected studies) represent a predominant solution, followed by evolution styles (25 %) and adaptation strategies and policies (22 %) to enable application of reuse knowledge. Empirical methods for acquisition of reuse knowledge represent 19 % including pattern discovery, configuration analysis, evolution and maintenance prediction techniques (approximately 6 % each). A lack of focus on empirical acquisition of reuse knowledge suggests the need of solutions with architecture change mining as a complementary and integrated phase for architecture change execution...|$|R
40|$|Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play {{a central}} role in {{eukaryotic}} signal transduction. However, the GPCR component of this signalling system, at the early origins of metazoans is not fully understood. Here <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> identify and <b>classify</b> GPCRs in Amphimedon queenslandica (sponge), a member of an earliest diverging metazoan lineage (Porifera). Furthermore, phylogenetic comparisons of sponge GPCRs with eumetazoan and bilaterian GPCRs will be essential to our understanding of the GPCR system at the roots of metazoan evolution. Results: We present a curated list of 220 GPCRs in the sponge genome after excluding incomplete sequences and false positives from our initial dataset of 282 predicted GPCR sequences obtained using Pfam search. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the sponge genome contains members belonging to four of the five major GRAFS families including Glutamate (33), Rhodopsin (126), Adhesion (40) and Frizzled (3). Interestingly, the sponge Rhodopsin family sequences lack orthologous relationships with those found in eumetazoan and bilaterian lineages, since they clustered separately to form sponge specific groups in the phylogenetic analysis. This suggests that sponge Rhodopsins diverged considerably from that found in other basal metazoans. A few sponge Adhesions clustered basal to Adhesion subfamilies commonly found in most vertebrates, suggesting some Adhesion subfamilies may have diverged prior to the emergence of Bilateria. Furthermore, at least eight of the sponge Adhesion members have a hormone binding motif (HRM domain) in their N-termini, although hormones have yet to be identified in sponges. We also phylogenetically clarified that sponge has homologs of metabotropic glutamate (mGluRs) and GABA receptors. Conclusion: Our phylogenetic comparisons of sponge GPCRs with other metazoan genomes suggest that sponge contains a significantly diversified set of GPCRs. This is evident at the family/subfamily level comparisons for most GPCR families, in particular for the Rhodopsin family of GPCRs. In summary, this study provides a framework to perform future experimental and comparative studies to further verify and understand the roles of GPCRs that predates the divergence of bilaterian and eumetazoan lineages.
