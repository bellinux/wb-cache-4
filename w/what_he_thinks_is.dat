5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>is</b> the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, {{and finally a}} tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been {{through the use of}} an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E

Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>is</b> a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E

With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion.

Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E

At first, they are unaware that [...] "Betelgeuse" [...] is pronounced [...] "Beetlejuice", {{which is why they}} have such difficulty pronouncing his name and thereby summoning him. However, Betelgeuse quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor; and they reconsider hiring him, though too late to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts. Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, Otho conducts <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>is</b> a sÃ©ance and summons Adam and Barbara, but they begin to decay and die, as Otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead.

After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder.

500|$|The band {{arrived at}} Pachyderm Studio without their {{equipment}} and {{spent much of}} the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail. [...] However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly. [...] On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued work through midnight. [...] Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band. [...] The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like [...] "Very Ape" [...] and [...] "tourette's", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural reverb. [...] Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones. [...] Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals. [...] The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape. [...] Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes. [...] He said, [...] "Generally speaking, [...] knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>is</b> acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...] He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable." [...] Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours. [...] The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard [...] "was supposedly this sexist jerk", but called the process [...] "the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down". [...] The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain. [...] The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.|$|E
