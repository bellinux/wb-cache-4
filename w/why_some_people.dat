5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E

Paramount to this view is that other human beings are often the harbinger of infectious diseases, which has profound implications for the evolution of human sociality. In The Parasite-Stress Theory of Values and Sociality: Infectious Disease, History and Human Values Worldwide, the authors bring a wealth of evidence from across many scholarly fields, much of which has been produced in the last decade, to support this claim.

500|$|In the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas {{regarded}} conscience as {{the application}} of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a. 13). [...] Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical reason that began with synderesis, the structured development of our innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of Natural Law) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles. According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or conscientia was an imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of the natural law (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (Summa Theologiae, I–II, I). Aquinas also discussed conscience {{in relation to the}} virtue of prudence to explain <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> appear to be less [...] "morally enlightened" [...] than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately balancing their own needs with those of others.|$|E

Recent research also suggests that von Willebrand factor is involved in the formation of blood vessels themselves, which would explain <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> with von Willebrand disease develop vascular malformations (predominantly in the digestive tract) that can bleed excessively.|$|E

A focus on process is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as Wallas) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative product usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful memes. The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.|$|E

From Belgium the modern version of the sport and the Voyageurs which the Flemish fanciers developed spread to most parts of the world.

2500|$|The {{study of}} SWB {{is a central}} concern of {{positive}} psychology. Positive psychology was founded by Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000) who identified that psychology {{is not just the}} study of pathology, weakness, and damage; but it is also the study of strength and virtue. Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every culture studied the pursuit of happiness is {{regarded as one of the}} most valued goals in life. Understanding individual differences in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times. Additionally, positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline. Lyubomirsky (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% of the variance in happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB. [...] She argued that changing one's external circumstances tends to have only a temporary effect on SWB, whereas engaging in activities (mental and/or physical) that enhance SWB can lead to more lasting improvements in SWB.|$|E
