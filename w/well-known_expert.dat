2500|$|David S. Touretzky, a {{research}} professor at Carnegie Mellon and a <b>well-known</b> <b>expert</b> on and critic of Scientology dismissed these perceived parallels, saying [...] "I don't see any Scientology content {{at all in}} this movie". He told Rich Juzwiak of Gawker, [...] "The themes of the movie appear to be standard adventure fare: physical courage, coming of age, father/son relationships, battling danger to prove oneself and earn a father's respect. These are not Scientology themes. There {{is no mention of}} evil psychiatrists, mind control, engrams, etc." [...] Touretzky also addressed multiple points made by the Scientology hypothesis including the film's marketing materials prominently featuring a volcano: [...] "The original version of Dianetics did not have any pictures on the cover. After Hubbard dreamed up OT III around 1967, someone got the idea of putting a volcano on the cover of Dianetics to 'restimulate the engrams' of us nonbelievers and influence us to buy the book. But most Scientologists don't know anything about OT III or why there is a volcano on the cover of some versions of Dianetics." ...|$|E
