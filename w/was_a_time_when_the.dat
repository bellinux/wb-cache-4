25|$|While Anglicans {{consolidated}} their hold on {{the upper}} classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the Methodist revivals, often sponsored by visiting preachers from the United States. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851–53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest {{of men and women}} in Christian perfection. Caughey bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.|$|E
25|$|Chenab {{colony of}} Lyallpur {{was a new}} colonial {{settlement}} and so was Lyallpur itself. Sunder Singh made Lyallpur his land of action and henceforth was nicknamed as Lyallpuri. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Hindu Arya Samaj movement was ruling supreme in Punjab and the Sikh masses were coming to its fold in large numbers. To counter this phenomenon, Sunder Singh Lyallpuri started educating the Sikh masses about Sikhism and its history. In association with S. Harchand Singh Ryees and some other well-wishers, Lyallpuri founded the Khalsa Bhujangi Sabha (Khalsa Youngman Association), the members of which {{played a leading role}} in the Sikh affairs and for the country as a whole. It was this association which had started the Gurdwara Rikabganj Morcha which was later supported by broad Sikh community and won the victory for the Akalis.|$|E

25|$|As {{the best}} and {{original}} state, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness {{in the form of}} a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere. Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of God. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.|$|E
500|$|The Florida state arms also depicts {{mountains}} in the distance but the highest point in the state is [...] feet high. In addition to the distortion of local geography, the image also contains historically inaccurate information. The period depicted in the state arms (c. 1830) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> local Seminole Native Americans were hostile toward white settlers; the warm greeting (e.g., flower petals strewn on the ground) offered by the Seminole to the arriving steam ship would have been highly improbable. Furthermore, the Seminole woman depicted would not have worn any headdress, particularly one of northern and western Seminole tribes.|$|E

2500|$|The Trinitarian {{historian}} Socrates of Constantinople {{reports that}} Arius sparked {{the controversy that}} bears his name when St. Alexander of Alexandria, who had succeeded Achillas as the Bishop of Alexandria, gave a sermon stating the similarity of the Son to the Father. Arius interpreted Alexander's speech as being a revival of Sabellianism, condemned it, and then argued that [...] "if the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he [...] had his substance from nothing." [...] This quote describes the essence of Arius' doctrine.|$|E
2500|$|Like many third-century Christian scholars, Arius was {{influenced}} by the writings of Origen, widely regarded as the first great theologian of Christianity. However, while he drew support from Origen's theories on the Logos, the two did not agree on everything. [...] Arius clearly argued that the Logos had a beginning and that the Son, therefore, was not eternal, and that the Son is clearly subordinate to the Father, the Logos being the highest of the Created Order. This idea is summarized in the statement [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Son was not." [...] By way of contrast, Origen taught that the Son was subject to the Father, and some of Origen's writings seem to imply that the Son is subordinate and less than the Father in some ways. However, Origen believed the relation of the Son to the Father had no beginning, and that the Son was [...] "eternally generated".|$|E

2500|$|According to Irish mythology, Samhain (like Bealtaine) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> 'doorways' to the Otherworld opened, {{allowing}} supernatural {{beings and}} {{the souls of}} the dead to come into our world; but while Bealtaine was a summer festival for the living, Samhain [...] "was essentially a festival for the dead". The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn says that the sídhe (fairy mounds or portals to the Otherworld) [...] "were always open at Samhain". It tells us that the High King of Ireland hosted a great gathering at Tara each Samhain. Each year the fire-breather Aillen emerges from the Otherworld and burns down the palace of Tara after lulling everyone to sleep with his music. One Samhain, the young Fionn mac Cumhaill is able to stay awake and slays Aillen with a magical spear, for which he is made leader of the fianna. Acallam na Senórach ('Colloquy of the Elders') tells how three female werewolves emerge from the cave of Cruachan (an Otherworld portal) each Samhain and kill livestock. When Cas Corach plays his harp, they take on human form, and the fianna warrior Caílte then slays them with a spear.|$|E
2500|$|Apollonius {{was among}} the {{foremost}} Homeric scholars in the Alexandrian period. He wrote the period's first scholarly monograph on Homer, critical of the editions of the Iliad and Odyssey published by Zenodotus, his predecessor {{as head of the}} Library of Alexandria. Argonautica seems to have been written partly as an experimental means of communicating his own researches into Homer's poetry. It has even been called [...] "a kind of poetic dictionary of Homer", without at all detracting from its merits as poetry. He has been credited with scholarly prose works on Archilochus and on problems in Hesiod. He is also considered {{to be one of the}} period's most important authors on geography, though approaching the subject differently from Eratosthenes, his successor at the library and a radical critic of Homer's geography. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> accumulation of scientific knowledge was enabling advances in geographical studies, as represented by the activities of Timosthenes, a Ptolemaic admiral and a prolific author. Apollonius set out to integrate new understandings of the physical world with the mythical geography of tradition and his Argonautica was, in that sense, a didactic epic on geography, again without detracting from its merits as poetry.|$|E
2500|$|Though his {{theology}} was {{at first}} somewhat indefinite in phraseology, he undoubtedly gave a thorough adhesion to the Nicene Orthodoxy. Even if he did avoid the debatable term homoousios, he expressed its sense in many passages, which exclude equally Patripassianism, Sabellianism, and the formula [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Son was not" [...] attributed to Arius. In other points he takes the ordinary ground of the Eastern Fathers, as in the emphasis he lays on {{the freedom of the}} will, the autexousion (αὐτεξούσιον), and in his view of the nature of sin. To him sin is the consequence of freedom, not a natural condition. The body is not the cause, but the instrument of sin. The remedy for it is repentance, on which he insists. Like many of the Eastern Fathers, he focuses on high moral living as essential to true Christianity. His doctrine of the Resurrection is not quite so realistic as that of other Fathers; but his conception of the Church is decidedly empirical: the existing Church form is the true one, intended by Christ, the completion of the Church of the Old Testament. His interpretation of the Eucharist is disputed. If he sometimes seems to approach the symbolic view, at other times he comes very close to a strong realistic doctrine. The bread and wine are not mere elements, but the body and blood of Christ.|$|E
