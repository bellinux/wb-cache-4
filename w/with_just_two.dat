5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would be needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757.

5|$|More {{effective}} tactics {{had to be}} used {{if there}} were to be no greater resources for the Command. Two major changes adopted by Coastal Command were sweeps over convoy routes and sweeps against U-boat transit routes. According to German and Italian submarine logs, both were effective and denied them the chance of shadowing convoys on the surface. It also rapidly increased the chances of a kill. The transit tactic over the Bay of Biscay resulted in many air-to-air and air-to-submarine combats, reaching its peak in 1943. As it was, in 1940 the Command was credited <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> sinkings with Navy vessels, one sunk unaided, and two damaged. The damaged ships could have been sunk had proper weapons been available.|$|E
5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward and reverse evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible automaton with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, in which each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular automaton in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E

5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to reassess their operational aims. Warr argued that they should move away from conventional operations and instead focus on population control and disrupting communist supply lines and freedom of movement. Assessing that <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> infantry battalions 1 ATF {{did not have the}} strength to destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon and search operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations. Two days later 5 RAR conducted a successful cordon and search of the village of Binh Ba as part of Operation Caloundra, screening 1,500 villagers and interrogating 591. Nine confirmed members of the Viet Cong were captured, while five draft dodgers were also detained. By mid-afternoon the operation had concluded without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for {{the first}} time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, {{all of which were}} won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing {{regulation}} which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began {{the final day of the}} match requiring 79 runs to win <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Rushden, Westley was {{appointed}} caretaker manager of Conference North outfit Kettering Town {{for the rest}} of the 2006–07 season in April 2007. Due to the date he joined, Westley was unable to bring any new players in to bolster the squad, <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> games remaining until the end of the season. His first game in charge was a 0–0 draw away to Stalybridge Celtic, shortly followed by a 1–0 loss to Alfreton Town at Rockingham Road – this was enough to ensure Kettering finished the season in second place. He managed Kettering in the play-offs, as they were beaten on penalties by Farsley Celtic in the semi-final after a 1–1 aggregate scoreline over two legs, he left shortly after when his short-term contract expired in May 2007, managing the club for a total of four games.|$|E

5|$|The final {{took place}} on 6 May 1970 at the San Siro in Milan against Dutch side Feyenoord. Celtic were {{overwhelming}} favourites, but despite Tommy Gemmell opening the scoring after 30 minutes, they were comprehensively outplayed by the Dutch side. Feyenoord manager Ernst Happel ensured Jimmy Johnstone was double marked at all times, while the midfield trio of Franz Hasil, Willem van Hanegem and Wim Jansen dominated their Celtic counterparts. Rinus Israël quickly equalised from a free kick, but Celtic managed to hold on at 11 to force extra time. <b>With</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> minutes of extra-time remaining, a long free-kick from the Feyenoord half was sent towards the Celtic penalty area. Billy McNeil stumbled and misjudged the ball, and {{as he tried to}} recover he appeared to punch the ball away. Before the referee had a chance to award a penalty, Ove Kindvall reacted quickly and took the ball round his man before chipping it over goalkeeper Evan Williams to seal a 2–1 win for Feyenoord.|$|E

5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E

5|$|At {{first light}} {{the next morning}} Australian {{clearing}} patrols located 89 dead and 11 wounded Viet Cong {{in front of their}} positions. The bulk of the casualties had been inflicted by the Americans, but it was later determined that at least 17 Viet Cong had been killed by 1 RAR. Others had been disintegrated by artillery and tank fire and the battlefield was littered with shattered human remains, including severed limbs and chunks of flesh, while red pulp covered the rubber trees that were still standing. Later, 154 bodies were bulldozed into a B-52 bomb crater nearby, while it was estimated that a further 200 Viet Cong casualties had been removed from the battlefield. Fifteen Viet Cong had also been captured during the battle, as had a large quantity of equipment, including small arms and ammunition, crew-served weapons and grenades. The villagers of Ap Bo were again used by the Viet Cong to carry many of the dead and wounded from the battlefield with ox carts, and they also suffered a number of casualties from artillery and mortar fire landing in the area. In contrast, American casualties were limited, consisting of 11 killed and 72 wounded. Australian casualties were lighter still, <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> men wounded. One American tank had also been destroyed, while two tanks and four armoured personnel carriers were damaged. Overall, the commander of the combined US-Australian force believed that they had won an impressive victory, but his troops were exhausted and with ammunition running low, Glotzbach decided not to pursue the withdrawing force. Instead, the Americans and Australians focused on securing the battlefield and evacuating their own casualties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, saboteurs caused a fire on Triglav, further eroding crew morale already under {{pressure}} from desertion. Elsewhere in the Bay of Kotor, Milan Spasić and Sergej Mašera died blowing up the destroyer Zagreb to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Following this, Kern decided to sail out <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> boats, Durmitor and Kajmakčalan, which he deemed had the most trustworthy crews, leaving the Bay of Kotor on 17 April. Because both boats were in poor condition and overloaded with personnel, the maximum speed they could achieve was 29 knots. Before passing through the Strait of Otranto, the boats successfully evaded two groups of Italian ships. They arrived at Navarino Bay in southern Greece on 19 April and at Souda Bay in Crete on 22 April, where they were tasked with escorting a convoy to Alexandria, protecting it from possible attacks from Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers. Once in Alexandria, they joined with other JKRM vessels and aircraft that had managed to escape, forming the JKRM in exile. The two boats were first tasked with patrolling {{the outside of the}} harbour in anticipation of an attack by Axis coastal craft. In June they operated against Vichy French forces in Syria. In 1944 they were reported as being tasked with escorting convoys between Alexandria and Port Said. However, with time the serviceability of the boats became a problem {{because of the lack of}} spare parts needed for their German-built engines.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1810, all the British {{troops and}} ships were {{assembled}} and Bertie ordered the squadron to rendezvous off Grand Baie, which was reached early on 29 November despite adverse winds. The vanguard landed unopposed, their landing craft supported by ship's boats carrying cannon, supplemented by the firepower {{of the larger}} ships offshore. Although there was some disruption {{in the early stages}} of the attack caused by adverse weather conditions, by 21:00 the entire vanguard and naval brigades were ashore. The landing had been effected <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> casualties, both men who died of natural causes. Keating took command of the vanguard and advanced on Fort Malartic, the garrison retreating before his troops and blowing up the fort as they left. During the morning of 30 November, Keating pushed southwards to the River Tombeau which overlooked Port Napoleon, his front units skirmishing with French defenders across the river, during which Decaen himself was lightly wounded by a musket ball. The bridge over the river had been held by a force of militia, but they fell back before the British advance and failed to properly demolish the bridge, allowing Keating to rapidly cross and threaten Port Napoleon. At Grand Baie, the remainder of the invasion force were coming ashore, so that the entire army had landed by midday, although Abercromby himself elected to stay with Beaver on HMS Nisus and follow the advance from offshore.|$|E
