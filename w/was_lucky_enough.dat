John <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to escape {{but many of}} his {{followers}} lost their lives. John Mackenzie also fought at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 where he was captured by the English. However his clan paid a ransom of cows for his release.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} pioneer days of Western Canada's prairie towns, when a good farming spot being settled, many {{people wanted to}} make money by {{building}} their own grain elevators. This brought in droves of private grain companies. Towns boasted dozens of elevator companies which all stood in a row along the railway tracks. If a town <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to have two railways, {{it was to be}} known as the next Montreal. In many elevator rows there would be two or more elevators of the same company. Small towns bragged of their large elevator rows in promotional pamphlets to attract settlers. With so much competition in the 1920s, consolidation began almost immediately, and many small companies were merged or absorbed into larger companies.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of the battle at around 07:30, patrols of [...] Don Cossacks from Matvei Platov's pulk had {{discovered}} a ford across the Kolocha river, on the extreme Russian right (northern) flank. Seeing that {{the ground in front of}} them was clear of enemy forces, Platov saw an opportunity to go around the French left flank and into the enemy's rear. He at once sent one of his aides to ask for permission from Kutuzov for such an operation. Platov's aide <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to encounter Colonel von Toll, an enterprising member of Kutuzov's staff, who suggested that General Uvarov's Ist Cavalry Corps be added to the operation and at once volunteered to present the plan to the commander-in-chief.|$|E

500|$|Despite good notices for the opera, Stanford's {{star was}} waning. In {{the first decade}} of the century, his music became eclipsed by that of a younger composer, Edward Elgar. In the words of the music scholar Robert Anderson, Stanford [...] "had his innings with {{continental}} reputation in the latter decades of the nineteenth century, but then Elgar bowled him out." [...] When Elgar was struggling for recognition in the 1890s, Stanford had been supportive of his younger colleague, conducting his music, putting him forward for a Cambridge doctorate, and proposing him for membership of the exclusive London club, the Athenaeum. He was, however, put out when Elgar's success at home and abroad eclipsed his own, with Richard Strauss (whom Stanford detested) praising Elgar as the first progressive English composer. When Elgar was appointed professor of music at Birmingham University in 1904, Stanford wrote him a letter that the recipient found [...] "odious". Elgar retaliated in his inaugural lecture with remarks about composers of rhapsodies, widely seen as denigrating Stanford. Stanford later counter-attacked in his book A History of Music, writing of Elgar, [...] "Cut off from his contemporaries by his religion and his want of regular academic training, he <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to enter the field and find the preliminary ploughing done." ...|$|E
500|$|The one {{exception}} to this process were the Tahirids, who remained in place as autonomous governors of their Khurasani super-province, encompassing most of the eastern Caliphate. In addition, the Tahirids provided the governor of Baghdad, and helped to keep the city, a focus of opposition to the Caliph under al-Ma'mun, quiescent. The post was held throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign by Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab, who, according to the Orientalist C. E. Bosworth, was [...] "always one of al-Mu'tasim's closest advisers and confidants". Apart from the Turkish military and the Tahirids, al-Mu'tasim's administration depended on the central fiscal bureaucracy. As {{the main source of}} revenue were the rich lands of southern Iraq (the Sawad) and neighbouring areas, the administration was staffed mostly with men drawn from these regions. The new caliphal bureaucratic class that emerged under al-Mu'tasim were thus mostly Persian or Aramean in origin, with a large proportion of newly converted Muslims and even a few Nestorian Christians, who came from landowner or merchant families. On his accession, al-Mu'tasim appointed as his chief minister or vizier his old personal secretary, al-Fadl ibn Marwan. A man trained in the traditions of the Abbasid bureaucracy, he was distinguished for his caution and frugality, and tried to shore up the finances of the state. These traits eventually caused his downfall, when he refused to authorize the Caliph's gifts to his courtiers on grounds that the treasury could not afford it. He was dismissed in 836, but <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> not to suffer further punishment other than being sent into exile to the village of al-Sinn. His replacement, Muhammad ibn al-Zayyat, was of a completely different character: a rich merchant, he is described by Kennedy as [...] "a competent financial expert but a callous and brutal man who made many enemies", even among his fellow members of the administration. Nevertheless, and even though his political authority never exceeded the fiscal domain, he managed to maintain his office throughout the reign, and under al-Mu'tasim's successor al-Wathiq (...) as well.|$|E

2500|$|Abdulmejid {{received}} a European education and spoke fluent French, the first sultan to do so. [...] Like Abdülaziz who succeeded him, {{he was interested}} in literature and classical music. Like his father Mahmud II, he was an advocate of reforms and <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to have the support of progressive viziers such as Mustafa Reşit Pasha, Mehmet Emin Ali Paşa and Fuad Pasha. Throughout his reign he had to struggle against conservatives who opposed his reforms. Abdulmejid was also the first sultan to directly listen to the public's complaints on special reception days, which were usually held every Friday without any middlemen. Abdulmejid toured the empire's territories to see in person how the Tanzimat reforms were being applied. [...] He travelled to İzmit, Mudanya, Bursa, Gallipoli, Çanakkale, Lemnos, Lesbos and Chios in 1844 and toured the Balkan provinces in 1846.|$|E

2500|$|Written by Fred Van Lente, {{with art}} by Neil Edwards, the comic (which {{is set in}} Romanoff's native Russia) first {{appeared}} in copies of the Maxim Russia magazine, before being released as a traditional, three-issue comic series on May 2, May 16, and June 6, 2012, respectively. The {{decision was made to}} give Romanoff her own comic ahead of The Avengers because Marvel felt that she [...] "remains the most enigmatic of the Avengers" [...] despite appearing in previous films. Van Lente explained the relationship between Black Widow Strikes and the films by saying, [...] "This is on the same scale as the Marvel movies. We’re working closely with Marvel Studios to have it integrate seamlessly with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once this is over, they’re welcome to use any of my ideas here for a movie." [...] Van Lente took inspiration [...] "from Joss Whedon's script for Marvel's the Avengers, which I <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to read.

2500|$|On November 21, 1947, the {{communist}} 10th Brigade of the 4th Column suddenly struck {{the town of}} Nanzhao (南召), and the nationalist garrison consisted on a security regiment and two companies was overwhelmed. [...] After losing three companies, including more than 50 killed and over 270 captured alive by the attacking enemy, the surviving nationalists were forced to abandon the town and flee, and thus town of Nanzhao (南召) {{had fallen into the}} enemy hands for the second time, and this time for good. [...] On November 22, 1947, as the nationalist commander Wang Jingxiu (王敬修)’s surviving Self Defense of the Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) reached Eight Mile Intersection (Ba Li Cha, 八里岔), King Yu’s Village (Wang Yu Zhuang, 王禹庄), and Eastern Qi Village (Dong Qi Zhuang, 东齐庄) regions south of Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城), it was ambushed by {{the communist}} 31st Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the 4th Column.

[...] On the other front, the communist 38th Army established a new base in the regions of Merchant County (Shang Xian, 商县), Luonan (洛南) and Merchant Southern (Shang Nan, 商南), while the communist 12th Brigade established another new base in the regions of Mountain Sun (Shan Yang, 山阳), Yun Xi (郧西), Zhen’an (Zhen An, 镇安), Upper Pass (Shang Guan, 上关).|$|E
