5|$|Air <b>Wonder</b> Stories and Science <b>Wonder</b> Stories were merged in 1930 as <b>Wonder</b> Stories, and the {{quarterly}} was renamed <b>Wonder</b> Stories Quarterly. The magazines were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold <b>Wonder</b> Stories to Ned Pines at Beacon Publications, where, retitled Thrilling <b>Wonder</b> Stories, it continued for nearly 20years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, {{and the title}} was then merged with Startling Stories, another of Pines' science fiction magazines. Startling itself lasted only {{to the end of}} 1955 before finally succumbing to the decline of the pulp magazine industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{covers for}} almost every issue of Air <b>Wonder,</b> Science <b>Wonder,</b> <b>Wonder</b> Stories and <b>Wonder</b> Stories Quarterly were painted by Frank R. Paul, who had {{followed}} Gernsback from Amazing Stories. The only exception was a cover image composed of colored dots, which {{appeared on the}} November 1932 issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{first issue}} of the merged {{magazine}} appeared in June 1930, still on a monthly schedule, with Lasser as editor. The volume numbering continued that of Science <b>Wonder</b> Stories, therefore <b>Wonder</b> Stories is sometimes regarded as a retitling of Science <b>Wonder</b> Stories. Gernsback had also produced a companion magazine for Science <b>Wonder</b> Stories, titled Science <b>Wonder</b> Quarterly, the {{first issue of}} which was published in the fall of 1929. Three issues were produced under this title, but after the merger Gernsback changed the companion magazine's title to <b>Wonder</b> Stories Quarterly, and produced a further eleven issues under that title.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wonder</b> Stories was {{an early}} American science fiction {{magazine}} which was published under several titles from 1929 to 1955. It was founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1929 after he had lost control of his first science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, when his media company Experimenter Publishing went bankrupt. Within {{a few months of}} the bankruptcy, Gernsback launched three new magazines: Air <b>Wonder</b> Stories, Science <b>Wonder</b> Stories and Science <b>Wonder</b> Quarterly.|$|E
5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a <b>Wonder,</b> an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building a <b>Wonder</b> triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's <b>Wonder</b> is {{in the shape of}} a landmark unique to that historical culture—the Temple of Heaven for the Chinese, for example, or Notre Dame for the Franks.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of Thrilling <b>Wonder</b> Stories the old <b>Wonder</b> Stories title was revived for two issues, {{published}} in 1957 and 1963. These were both edited by Jim Hendryx Jr. They were numbered vol. 45, no. 1 and 2, continuing the volume numbering of Thrilling <b>Wonder.</b> Both were selections from past issues of Thrilling Wonder; the second one convinced Ned Pines, the publisher who had bought <b>Wonder</b> Stories from Gernsback in 1936 and who still owned {{the rights to the}} stories, to start a reprint magazine called Treasury of Great Science Fiction Stories in 1964; a companion, Treasury of Great Western Stories, was added the next year.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{other authors}} and organisations have {{composed}} {{lists of the}} <b>wonders</b> of the world. Travel writer Howard Hillman published two books on the subject, one with 10 man-made <b>wonders,</b> and one with 10 natural <b>wonders.</b> British biographer, science writer, and novelist Ronald W. Clark published a book of man-made and natural <b>wonders</b> titled <b>Wonders</b> of the World, which lists 52 <b>wonders,</b> one for each week of the year.|$|R

The series then became focused on Christina and Melanie and their horses <b>Wonder's</b> Star, Perfect Image, and Hi Jinx.|$|R

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1949 Street & Smith, {{one of the largest}} pulp publishers, had shut down every one of their pulps. This format was dying out, though it took several more years before the pulps {{completely}} disappeared from the newsstands. Both Thrilling <b>Wonder</b> and Startling went quarterly in 1954, {{and at the end of}} that year Mines left. The magazines did not survive him for long; only two more issues of Thrilling <b>Wonder</b> appeared, both edited by Alexander Samalman. After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling <b>Wonder</b> was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} the price and format, looking for a {{profitable}} combination. Both Air <b>Wonder</b> and Science <b>Wonder</b> were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of <b>Wonder</b> Stories. With the November 1930 issue <b>Wonder</b> Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications Thrilling <b>Wonder</b> remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E

5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations must build a <b>Wonder</b> to advance from age to age, instead of {{advancing}} from the Town Center. Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} <b>wonder.</b> Players can choose from a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this <b>wonder</b> provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the <b>wonder</b> is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Wonder</b> Boy in Monster Land, players control <b>Wonder</b> Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, <b>Wonder</b> Boy starts {{out in the}} City of <b>Wonder</b> Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move <b>Wonder</b> Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes <b>Wonder</b> Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes <b>Wonder</b> Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E
5|$|Maloney and Smythe's {{most famous}} horse <b>Wonder</b> Where, {{also led to}} {{the breakup of the}} partnership. <b>Wonder</b> Where, named by Maloney, was bred at Frank Selke's farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957. In 1959, <b>Wonder</b> Where had an {{outstanding}} season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The <b>Wonder</b> Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing <b>Wonder</b> Where and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that.|$|E
