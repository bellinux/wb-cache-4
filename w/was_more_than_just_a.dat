Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career. The company to her <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> business, but a family too. She also enjoyed {{the idea of having}} a group of girls around her and working for a company run by a woman. Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her masturbation scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E

Behind the frontline, Ling Tong conceived a strategy for dealing with and pacifying the Shanyue tribes – impressing them with a show of military might and offering them potential rewards – {{which led to the}} Wu government successfully recruiting over 10,000 Shanyue soldiers into their army and maintaining relative stability in the region. Ling Tong was also known for his integrity and loyalty; he, along with Lü Meng, were among Sun Quan's most valued generals.|$|E

In the stone IG I3 386-387 {{it can be seen}} how the finances of the Eleusinian temples worked. Doctor Maureen B. Cavanaugh who translated stone IG I3 386-387, argues that there were heavy implications of the funding realized from the First Fruits donations to the temple, in particular that it brought significant impact on Athenian power. This is noted in a loan cited in the stone record, of over 20,000 silver drachmas to the city. The Eleusinian temple complex <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> temple to Demeter; there were living quarters, storage, workshops, administration as well as public spaces.

500|$|Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier {{described}} The Black Island as [...] "a clever little thriller" [...] {{that bore}} similarities {{with the popular}} detective serials of the era. The Lofficiers thought that the 1966 version [...] "gained in slickness" [...] but became less atmospheric, awarding it two out of five. Biographer Benoît Peeters thought The Black Island to be [...] "a pure detective story", describing it as [...] "Remarkably well constructed" [...] and highlighting that it contrasted the modern world of counterfeiters, airplanes, and television, with the mysteries of superstition and the historic castle. He described it as [...] "an adventure full of twists and turns", with the characters Thompson and Thomson being [...] "on top form". He nevertheless considered the 1966 version to be [...] "shorter on charm" [...] than the earlier versions. Elsewhere he was more critical, stating that [...] "under the guise of modernization, a real massacre occurred", and adding that [...] "the new Black Island <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> failure; it also showed one {{of the limitations of}} the Hergéan system", in that it was obsessed with repeated redrawing.|$|E
500|$|Train {{service at}} Great Notch {{originated}} {{with the introduction}} of the Caldwell Railway, a service that went from the community of Caldwell, New Jersey to the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway. Twelve trains a day served Caldwell, Verona and Overbrook Hospital. The station at Great Notch was deemed Caldwell Junction, inferring the junction between the two railways. The Great Notch station depot was built in 1905 for the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway, a subsidiary of the Erie Railroad. The station was built as a green-red [...] "type five" [...] frame structure. While the main building was 12' × 28' × 18' in size, the station also included an old boxcar used as a tool house. The box car was only 12' × 45' and served the station for several decades. The station was just east of the [...] "GA" [...] signal tower, which was built in 1900 to serve the junction of the Greenwood Lake Railway and its Caldwell Branch, heading eastward for the communities of Cedar Grove, Verona, Caldwell and Essex Fells. The station also served a local yard for train storage for the branch line via a wye. At Essex Fells, connections could be made for train service to Morristown via the Morristown and Erie Railroad. [...] The Caldwell Railroad diverged from the current New Jersey Transit line about 1/4 mile west of the New Jersey Transit Great Notch station and followed its own route to Caldwell. The station at Great Notch <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> building for people at the railroad. The station had a large water tower next to GA Signal and a potbelly stove. The station was tended by a husband and wife combination, serving the locals their daily newspapers and their mail. Great Notch did not receive mail delivery until the mid-1950s.|$|E

500|$|To resolve {{questions}} about the blades, Pistorius was asked {{to take part in}} a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed. In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to Die Welt newspaper that Pistorius [...] "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear." [...] The study was published in 2008 in Sports Technology, but later researchers stated that the analysis [...] "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge. Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.|$|E
