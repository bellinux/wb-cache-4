5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a <b>Windows</b> <b>registry</b> entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|TuneUp Utilities 2003: The {{first version}} {{to have become}} {{available}} in English and French, {{as well as the}} original German language. It consists of 16 individual tools accessible through the Start Center, as well as the Windows start menu. It includes features to clean the hard disks, clean and defragment the <b>Windows</b> <b>Registry,</b> optimize Windows and Internet connection settings and change {{the look and feel of}} Windows. It also provides features targeted at users with an intermediate or advanced level of computer knowledge that enables them to edit the registry, manage running processes, uninstall programs, shred and undelete files, and display system information. In addition to the previously-supported Windows 95 and Windows 98, TuneUp Utilities 2003 also supports Windows 2000, Me and Windows XP.|$|E

50|$|MCI {{makes it}} very simple to write a program which can play {{a wide variety of}} media files and even to record sound by just passing {{commands}} as strings. It uses relations described in <b>Windows</b> <b>registries</b> or in the MCI section of the file system.ini. One advantage of this API is that MCI commands can be transmitted both from the programming language and from the scripting language (open script, lingo aso). Example of such commands are mciSendCommand or mciSendString.|$|R
50|$|In August 2013 Mama Singhateh was {{appointed}} to the Cabinet of the Government of The Gambia to occupy the position of Attorney General and Minister of Justice. This appointment was seen as a very strategic one given her previous vast experience within this Ministry. Her stint as Minister saw the launch of major projects within the justice sector, notably the refurbishment of the Ministry's premises and for the very first time, the launching of the Single Business <b>Window</b> <b>Registry.</b> She was relieved of her appointment as Minister of Justice in August 2014. In January 2015 she was re-appointed Attorney General and Minister of Justice, a position that she currently holds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{present and}} future smart grid has {{a large number of}} devices that produce an {{avalanche}} of data. Our research explores whether we can channel this avalanche to drive more efficient NERC CIP audits. The power industry has both high-level, natural-language NERC CIP policies and lowlevel data sources such as router configuration files, <b>Windows</b> <b>registries,</b> and PMU data. Utilities must use low-level data to demonstrate compliance at a high level and each utility does this in their own way. In this paper, we propose our two tools, Context-Free Grep and Hierarchical Diff, to help utilities and auditors generate reliable and reproducible evidence to support or refute NERC CIP compliance. Our tools are currently in the design phase, although we have prototyped Hierarchical Diff. I...|$|R
25|$|Such {{programs}} {{inspect the}} contents of the <b>Windows</b> <b>registry,</b> operating system files, and installed programs, and remove files and entries which match a list of known spyware. Real-time protection from spyware works identically to real-time anti-virus protection: the software scans disk files at download time, and blocks the activity of components known to represent spyware.|$|E
25|$|Note that {{examination}} of the AutoPlayHandlers section of the <b>Windows</b> <b>Registry</b> reveals the ContentTypeSniffers and ContentTypeHandlers keys. Off these keys, various subkeys and values would appear to relate to and even control volume-based AutoPlay. However, as of Windows XP SP2, these keys are defined solely for future use and are not accessed by AutoPlay.|$|E
25|$|TweakUI, an {{unsupported}} {{utility program}} from Microsoft, offers additional customizations, including {{speeding up the}} response time of the Start menu, window animation, and other hacks. On Windows XP and Windows Vista, {{it is possible to}} prevent specific programs from appearing in the recent programs list (the left pane of the Start menu) by modifying the <b>Windows</b> <b>registry.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>Windows</b> <b>Registry</b> {{contains}} multiple sections where {{modification of}} key values allows software {{to be executed}} automatically when the operating system boots. Spyware can exploit this design to circumvent attempts at removal. The spyware typically will link itself from each location in the registry that allows execution. Once running, the spyware will periodically check {{if any of these}} links are removed. If so, they will be automatically restored. This ensures that the spyware will execute when the operating system is booted, even if some (or most) of the registry links are removed.|$|E
25|$|During the {{rendering}} process, {{the filter}} graph searches the <b>Windows</b> <b>Registry</b> for registered filters and builds its graph of filters {{based on the}} locations provided. After this, it connects the filters together, and, at the developer's request, executes (i.e., plays, pauses, etc.) the created graph. DirectShow filter graphs are widely used in video playback (in which the filters implement functions such as file parsing, video and audio demultiplexing, decompressing and rendering) {{as well as for}} video and audio recording, editing, encoding, transcoding or network transmission of media. Interactive tasks such as DVD navigation may also be controlled by DirectShow.|$|E
25|$|In Visual Studio 2012 RC, a {{major change}} to the {{interface}} {{is the use of}} all-caps menu bar, as part of the campaign to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user interfaces, and to provide added structure to the top menu bar area. The redesign was criticized for being hard to read, and going against the trends started by developers to use CamelCase to make words stand out better. Some speculated that the root cause of the redesign was to incorporate the simplistic look and feel of Metro apps. However, there exists a <b>Windows</b> <b>Registry</b> option to allow users to disable the all-caps interface.|$|E

5000|$|Radmind {{operates}} as a tripwire, detecting changes in a client's filesystem (and, {{in the case of}} Microsoft <b>Windows,</b> the <b>registry)</b> and reversing the changes. Radmind stores filesystem specifications in text files called transcripts, signified with a [...]T extension. Transcripts are referenced from command files, signified with a [...]K extension, which specify which transcripts (and with what precedence) should be applied to a client machine's filesystem.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike <b>Windows</b> 95's <b>registry,</b> Qvwm uses a textual {{configuration}} file. Qvwm includes virtual desktops, {{a feature}} lacking in Windows 95. One reviewer criticized this practice as [...] "against qvwm's stated purpose." [...] Apart from standard X libraries, the only software library {{it depends on}} is X PixMap (libxpm). The developers had intended to develop a full class library called libqv but this never occurred.|$|R
500|$|PC World's Preston Gralla {{reviewed}} the 2010 version and commented that TuneUp Utilities {{is a comprehensive}} suite that “includes everything from a startup optimizer to a [...] defragmenter, from an overall speed optimizer to a <b>Windows</b> <b>Registry</b> cleaner, and more.” However, {{he said that the}} high price of the entire suite ($50) might make the purchase decision more difficult. Preston had also previously reviewed TuneUp Utilities 2009 for PC Advisor and gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.|$|E

50|$|In {{previous}} {{versions of}} <b>Windows,</b> the <b>registry</b> size {{was limited to}} 80% of the paged pool size. In <b>Windows</b> XP, the <b>registry</b> is reimplemented outside of the paged pool; the registry hives are memory mapped by the Cache Manager into the system cache, eliminating the registry size limit. The registry size is now limited only by the available disk space. The System hive still has a maximum size, {{but it has been}} raised from 12 MB to 200 MB, eliminating the issue previous Windows versions faced of being unable to boot because of a large or fragmented System hive. The Configuration Manager has been updated to minimize the registry's memory footprint and lock contention, reduce fragmentation and thus page faults when accessing the registry, and improved algorithms to speed up registry query processing. An in-memory security cache eliminates redundant security descriptors.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this would be {{attempting}} to explain to a lay person the method and techniques of decoding the UserAssist Key in the <b>Windows</b> System <b>Registry.</b> The UserAssist key can hold {{a great deal of information}} about the actions of the user of the computer. However to explain this key, the reviewer has to be able to identify the key and correctly interpret the key setting. The keys are often encoded by ROT 13.|$|R
