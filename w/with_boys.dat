5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work <b>with</b> <b>boys</b> and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

5|$|Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a {{fisherman}} who lives {{along with his}} daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront {{by one of his}} ancestors who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships <b>with</b> <b>boys</b> because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.|$|E
5|$|Having {{worked with}} Cary Guffey on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg felt {{confident}} {{in working with}} a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the movie Raggedy Man which Jack Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes <b>with</b> <b>boys</b> auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience made him feel ready to be a father.|$|E
5|$|Makoto first appears {{when the}} cast is in sixth grade, though is in a {{different}} class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto was also assigned male at birth, but wishes {{to be a girl}} and shares Shuichi's interest in cross-dressing; it is this that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for wanting to be a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well <b>with</b> <b>boys</b> and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to {{what is going on in}} other characters' lives. Makoto is an only child whose parents run a bakery.|$|E

5|$|Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a {{successful}} London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing {{as a vehicle for}} moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity <b>with</b> <b>boys,</b> his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.|$|E
5|$|Yet despite {{significant}} reorganisations of the post-Federation Army in 1903 and 1906, the force-in-being {{was increasingly}} seen as dysfunctional and inadequate, suffering from perceived institutional problems regarding structure, command, and administration, {{as well as}} limited financial resources, lack of modern equipment, and poor training. In time this led the government to decide to adopt an entirely new military system. In 1911, two significant changes followed a report by Lord Kitchener following his inspection of local forces in 1909. The Royal Military College, Duntroon was established to train staff officers, and a system of universal national service began <b>with</b> <b>boys</b> aged 12 to 18 becoming cadets, and men aged 18 to 26 serving in the Citizen Forces. These reforms {{were part of a}} process of raising a large civilian militia to defend the country against a feared attack by Japan. This force was based on conscription, and was intended to be complete in 1920. The resources devoted to this plan greatly exceeded those allocated to preparations to raise an expeditionary force to serve outside Australia. In total, a peace-time force of around 80,000 citizen soldiers, with a war-time establishment of 135,000, was to be raised and would include 84 infantry battalions (later increased to 92), 28 light horse regiments (subsequently raised to 31), 49 field batteries and seven howitzer batteries (total of 224 guns), 14 field engineer companies, seven communication companies, and various support troops.|$|E
