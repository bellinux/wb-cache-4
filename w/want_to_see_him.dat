5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|Jacques {{reports the}} call to the police, who have been {{investigating}} the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker, whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot, an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, coerces a young woman named Paulette Mérodon (recently arrested for shoplifting) to help investigate by checking herself into Génessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. Génessier. Génessier {{is about to begin}} surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, {{though he did not}} tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> gain high office.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{directors}} did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as President. But for the previous 20 years, though he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had de facto control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him, and he served {{until the end of}} the war. During this period the company began to decline, losing more than $10million a month ($ today). The administration of President Franklin Roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production, but the idea never progressed.|$|E
25|$|Safely on Earth, {{they watch}} as the winged {{creature}} inside the moon breaks free of the shell and flies off, but not before laying another egg that becomes a replacement moon for Earth. The Doctor reveals that the sudden interest in the moon will reinvigorate Earth's space program, and Lundvik will {{get the opportunity to}} realise her dream. The Doctor returns Courtney and Clara to their rightful time; Clara angrily accosts the Doctor for forcing her to make the decision on the fate of humanity, while the Doctor asserts he cannot be allowed to make those choices himself. Clara tells the Doctor she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again, and takes comfort with Danny Pink, though Danny sees she is still not ready to forget the Doctor. Clara returns to her flat that evening and looks reflectively at the moon.|$|E
25|$|But his {{untapped}} {{talent was}} volcanic: In 1990, Johnson {{became the first}} left-hander to strike out Wade Boggs three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with Nolan Ryan late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan {{has said that he}} appreciated Johnson's talent and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently. In a September 27, 1992 game against the Texas Rangers, with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.|$|E

2500|$|In press interviews, Myrons Captain Neal leveled {{criminal}} charges against the captains of Adriatic and H.P. McIntosh that prompted an investigation of many months by United States marine inspectors. At a special Steamboat Inspection Service hearing, Captain Neal stated: I was clinging {{to the roof of}} the pilothouse when the McIntosh hailed me shortly after the Myron went down from under me. The McIntosh drew alongside me, not more than [...] away. Although it was dusk, the ship was so close that I had no difficulty in making out her name. I talked to the captain and expected that he would put out a yawl and pick me up. He did not do so, nor attempt in any way to help me. 'I will have a boat sent for you,' the captain of the McIntosh called. And he drew away. I have never seen him since, nor do I ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> by the great hokey, pokey.|$|E

However, Lucy text messages him at the party saying {{she will not be}} there and does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again. [...] The next day, Penny goes to comfort a heartbroken Raj, who thinks he is completely unlovable. Penny suggests that this lament is attributed to alcohol, but Raj says he that he has not had a drink since the night before: he is finally cured of his selective mutism.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{idea was}} abandoned, and instead {{production}} {{moved on to}} , a new television series intended for the Paramount Television Service upon its launch in April 1978. It was claimed by Roddenberry that Nimoy said he was unwilling to return to television as Spock. However, Nimoy said that the first offer Roddenberry gave was a contract for the pilot of the new series, and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes thereafter, which Nimoy rejected. At the time, Nimoy had undertaken a legal challenge against Paramount related to the Heineken adverts and Roddenberry had refused to support his case. Work began on a replacement Vulcan, Xon, with David Gautreaux cast. Production gradually changed {{to the creation of}} a feature film over the course of five months in 1977. This resulted in [...] For the film, Nimoy was persuaded to return by [...] Jeffrey Katzenberg and the film's director Robert Wise. [...] Xon was removed from the story at the request of Gautreaux who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as a secondary character. He appeared in the film in a different role.|$|E

2500|$|Tsukuru Tazaki is a 36-year-old {{man whose}} {{defining}} features are {{his love of}} train stations and the fact his four best friends all ceased {{to speak to him}} during his second year at university: [...] "Like Jonah in the belly of the whale, Tsukuru had fallen into the bowels of death, one untold day after another, lost in a dark, stagnant void." [...] He now lives in Tokyo and has started seeing a new girlfriend, Sara Kimoto, who works at a travel agency.
