5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|When {{still in}} operation, the power {{stations}} appeared in films and television programs {{shot in the}} Newcastle area. They appeared in Payroll, a movie made in 1961, starring Michael Craig. One of two security van operators lives in Stella park, a housing estate above the power station. It is prominently in the background whenever the van operator's home is shown. In 1985, the Stella power stations are seen briefly in a shot in Seacoal, a movie made by Amber Films. They appear during a scene where the two protagonists, Ray and Betty, are travelling from Sunderland to Newcastle. (Lynemouth power station, a North East power station still in operation, is more prominent in the film.) In <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Likely Lads?, a British sitcom broadcast between 1973 and 1974, the stations themselves did {{not appear in the}} series, but in the end credits their ash boat, Bessie Surtees, could be seen passing Spiller's Wharf near Byker. In 1981, it was featured in Swing Bridge Videos' Check it Out, a short film about youth unemployment in the west end of Newcastle. In the mid-1990s, the decommissioned stations were photographed by north eastern artist John Kippin as part of his work The Secret Intelligence of the Silent. This piece was exhibited at the Laing Art Gallery in 2012 as part of the exhibition Futureland Now.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} humour, the two shows are very different. The Likely Lads {{had been a}} broad comedy, full of jokes and obvious gags, whereas <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Likely Lads? used much subtler humour, derived from the {{dialogue}} and characterisation, often interspersed with sentimentality (as the Lads mourned their lost past), and even touches of pathos.|$|E
25|$|Predictably, the {{selection}} process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions {{as to whether they}} deserved election.

25|$|<b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Likely Lads? is a British sitcom {{which was}} {{broadcast}} between 9 January 1973 and 9 April 1974 on BBC1.

There were 26 television episodes over two series; and a subsequent 45-minute Christmas special was aired on 24 December 1974.|$|E

25|$|The {{three stars}} were 19-year-old Victoria Lambert as the 13-year-old Marcie, Ben Chandler as Tom and Kate Winslet, {{in her first}} major {{professional}} acting role, as Reet. There were several supporting actors who were well-known names on British television: Miss Maitland was played by Brigit Forsyth who had starred in the popular sitcom <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Likely Lads? in the 1970s, and Miss Pendragon was played by Jacqueline Pearce, who was well known {{for her role as}} the villainous Servalan in the late 1970s / early 80s BBC science-fiction series Blake's 7, and known by Cant from working with her on the serial Moondial. According to an interview with SFX magazine, Davies said that Pearce was delighted that her character {{was supposed to be a}} lesbian, but refused to dye her hair, hence the turban.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, C. Everett Koop wrote The Right to Live, The Right to Die, {{setting down}} his own {{concerns}} about abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia.

Frank Schaeffer and his associate, Jim Buchfuehrer provided a private, five-hour screening of <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Human Race? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that, according to Frank Schaeffer's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book Crazy for God, led to both the Schaeffers and Koop obtaining [...] "...access to everyone in the Republican Party". Joanne Kemp once suffered a miscarriage, which Kemp later said made him re-evaluate the sanctity of human life and affirmed his opposition to abortion.|$|E

[...] Harrison said: [...] "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go," [...] and [...] "Historically it may look like we did something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better." [...] Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: [...] "I never felt sorry … I was not involved." [...] In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies wrote: [...] "But for the sake of Pete's career, <b>whatever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beatles afterward, the handling and especially the announcing of the sacking might have been done more neatly and cleanly. He could have been fixed up with a job in another group before the news was announced." [...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out. It was the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power." ...|$|E

The rivalry has also made its way into various aspects of English popular culture.
