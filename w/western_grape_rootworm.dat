40|$|This study {{evaluated}} how the proportional area {{of natural}} habitat surrounding a vineyard (i. e. landscape diversity) worked {{in conjunction with}} crop vigor, cultivar and rootstock selection to influence biological control of the <b>western</b> <b>grape</b> leafhopper (Erythroneura elegantula Osborn). The key natural enemies of E. elegantula are Anagrus erythroneurae S. Trjapitzin & Chiappini and A. daanei Triapitsyn, {{both of which are}} likely impacted by changes in landscape diversity due to their reliance on non-crop habitat to successfully overwinter. Additionally, E. elegantula is sensitive to changes in host plant quality which may influence densities on specific cultivars, rootstocks and/or vines with increased vigor. From 2010 - 2013, data were collected on natural enemy and leafhopper densities, pest parasitism rates and vine vigor from multiple vineyards that represented a continuum of landscape diversity. Early in the season, vineyards in more diverse landscapes had higher Anagrus spp. densities and lower E. elegantula densities, which led to increased parasitism of E. elegantula. Although late season densities of E. elegantula tended to be lower in vineyards with higher early season parasitism rates and lower total petiole nitrogen content, they were also affected by rootstock and cultivar. While diverse landscapes can support higher natural enemy populations, which can lead to increased biological control, leafhopper densities also appear to be mediated by cultivar, rootstock and vine vigor...|$|R

40|$|This study {{looked at}} {{regulated}} deficit irrigation (RDI) on leafhoppers in the genus Erythroneura (Erythroneura elegantula Osborn, or <b>western</b> <b>grape</b> leafhopper, and Erythroneura variabilis Beamer) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), which are serious pests of cultivated grape (Vitis vinifera L.) in California. RDI is an irrigation strategy that reduces irrigation during {{a critical point}} in the phenology of a cultivated perennial crop, to improve vegetative balance and crop quality. Erythroneura spp. are known to respond negatively to vine water stress, and the second generation of leafhoppers begins during a potential RDI initiation period, between berry set and veraison (beginning of fruit maturation). In experiments at commercial wine grape vineyards, I imposed deficits of between 25 and 50 % of crop full evapotranspiration (ETc) between berry set and veraison, with control treatments based on the growers’ standard irrigations (typically between 0. 8 and 1. 0 ETc), and then we counted leafhopper nymphs weekly, and leafhopper eggs after the second generation. Results show a consistent reduction of second generation nymphal density {{with this type of}} RDI, with average density ≈ 50 % lower under deficit treatments in all three studies. Deficit irrigation reduced second generation egg density by 54 % at one site and by 29. 9 % at another. These results confirm previous studies regarding the sensitivity of Erythroneura spp. to grapevine water stress, and, in addition, they show that a season-wide irrigation deficit is not necessary for reduction in leafhopper density. Results suggest that lower oviposition at least partly explains the lower nymphal density in the deficit treatments...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{studies in}} a Paso Robles, CA, grape (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard in 2002 and 2003 {{to estimate the}} impact of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) intensity and duration on <b>western</b> <b>grape</b> leafhopper, Erythroneura elegantula Osborn. Treatments were based on deficit intensity, 50 and 25 % of standard irrigation (moderate and severe deficits, respectively), and deficit duration, 3 or 6 wk time, initiated at the grape phenological stage of berry set. The standard irrigation served as the control, and {{was intended to be}} as close to 100 % of evapotranspiration (1. 0 ETc) for grape in this area. Each week we took counts of leafhopper nymphs and estimated stomatal conductance, {{and at the end of}} each leafhopper generation we counted live, hatched and parasitized leafhopper eggs. Second generation leafhopper nymphal density was lowered by about 38 and 70 % in 2002 and 2003, respectively, but in 2003 only the severe deÞcit had a negative effect on the third generation. This same pattern was seen in oviposition: second generation egg density was reduced by about 44 % in the deficit treatments, but in the third generation only the severe deficit was lower than the control. There was little difference between the 3 vs. 6 wk duration in nymphal or egg density. The differences among treatments in second generation peak nymphal density were greater than the differences in second generation hatched eggs, suggesting that in addition to egg mortality, the deficits also affected nymphal mortality. Management strategies for maintaining leafhopper density low in the second generation and third generations include maintaining a sub- 1. 0 ETc irrigation strategy after the main RDI period, or reinstating the RDI to correspond to the third generation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Western</b> <b>grape</b> {{leafhopper}} (WGLH) (Erythroneura elegantula Osborn) is {{a serious}} pest of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) in many commercial vineyard growing regions of California. WGLH injures vines by removing leaf photosynthetically active area, resulting in the reduction of leaf efficiency, ultimately reducing yield and fruit quality. Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) is a widely adopted irrigation strategy that reduces irrigation during critical phenological growing points (i. e., berry-set to verasion) to manage vegetative growth and berry size of red varieties. Leafhoppers are known to respond negatively to vine water stress. In a two year study at a commercial vineyard located in Paso Robles, California, RDI was imposed on Cabernet Sauvignon winegrapes. Two treatments were looked at, intensity of deficit (25 % and 50 % of the grower’s standard irrigations, i. e., close to 1. 0 ETc) and, duration of deficit (3 weeks and 6 weeks, starting at berry set). Weekly counts of WGLH nymphs were taken, and then eggs were counted {{after the end of}} the second and third generations. Vine water status was monitored with a pressure chamber and stomatal conductance was measured with an LI- 6200 CO 2 porometer. Results confirm other studies that have shown that leafhoppers are sensitive to vine water status. In year two of the study, second generation WGLH nymphal density was significantly reduced by RDI but the effect did not last through the third generation, and there was no difference in intensity or duration of the deficit. Second generation WGLH oviposition was also significantly reduced by RDI, and there was no difference in intensity or duration of the deficit. However, oviposition was reduced in the third generation only in the 25 % deficit treatment, and there was no difference between deficit duration. One possible explanation for lower oviposition is leaf epidermal tissue becomes more difficult to penetrate due to a physiological response to thicken leaf cuticle in an attempt to conserve water during times of water stress. This reduction in egg density may in part, explain the reduction in nymphal density...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{is characterized by}} specialized production {{and the use of}} monoculturecropping practices. These agroecosystems are at once concentrating habitat for crop pests andeliminating habitat for natural enemies. Multiple studies have demonstrated that such changescan lead to a decrease or total loss of biological control of pests. At the same time, expansion ofmonoculture cropping systems across entire agricultural regions has led to the creation oflandscapes that are entirely dominated by a small number of crops and devoid of naturalhabitats. In the same way, entire regions can experience a reduction or loss of biological controlto agriculture. As such, {{a number of studies have}} compared crop fields with high and low habitat diversity andfound that diversified cropping systems tend to have enhance natural enemy populations andincreased biological control of pests. At the same time, another set of studies have demonstratedthat monoculture cropping systems can still experience high levels of biological control so longas they are situated in a landscape with high levels of habitat diversity surrounding them. Morerecently, it has been proposed that the use of on-farm habitat diversification to enhancebiological control will likely be influenced by the area and quality of natural habitat surroundingthe farm (i. e. landscape diversity). This dissertation was designed to evaluate the influence of habitat diversity at the local andlandscape scale on biological control of the <b>Western</b> <b>grape</b> leafhopper (Erythroneura elegantulaOsborn; Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in North Coast wine grape vineyards. The key parasitoids of E. elegantula are Anagrus eryhthroneurae S. Trjapitzin & Chiappini and A. daanei Triapitsyn(Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). These Anagrus parasitoids are intimately tied to the natural habitatsthat surround vineyards due to the fact that in order for them to successfully overwinter theymust parasitize an alternate leafhopper host that overwinters in an egg stage (E. elegantulaoverwinters in the vineyard as an adult). These alternate leafhopper hosts are known to reside inthe natural and semi-natural habitats that surround North Coast vineyards. As such, it is thoughtthat biological control of E. elegantula in vineyards is particularly sensitive to changes inlandscape diversity. At the same time, the use of monoculture cropping practices results in avineyard environment that is very inhospitable to natural enemies of E. elegantula, includingAnagrus spp. Previous studies have demonstrated that without floral nectar (or an analogoussolution) the lifespan of Anagrus parasitoids can be less than two days and it may be that theintroduction of flowering cover crops into vineyards could possibly increase biological control ofE. elegantula by enhancing Anagrus longevity in the field. In this way, increased habitat diversityat both the field and landscape scale may support increased natural enemy populations whichwould lead to increased biological control of E. elegantula. For this dissertation, a series of studies were conducted in order to evaluate how changes inhabitat diversity at the field and landscape scale could affect natural enemy populations andultimately influence biological control of E. elegantula. First, overwintering habitat of Anagrusspp. was evaluated to identify the specific host plant species that contained leafhopper eggs thatthese parasitoids were attacking in natural habitats during the winter, as well as throughout therest of the year. Second, vineyards that were adjacent to riparian habitat were studied in orderto evaluate how distance away from a large natural habitat patch influenced the timing, densityand impact of natural enemies in the vineyard. Third, in order to isolate the influence oflandscape diversity, a multi-year study was conducted to monitor biological control of E. elegantula in a number of vineyard monocultures that were situated in low, intermediate andhigh diversity landscapes. Finally, over the course of several years the use of flowering summercover crops was developed in collaboration with commercial wine grape growers and vineyardtrials were subsequently conducted to evaluate the ability of these flowering cover crops toenhance biological control of E. elegantula. In order to evaluate how changes in the landscapeinfluenced the effectiveness of this on-farm habitat diversification practice, these cover cropstudies were conducted at multiple vineyards that were situated in low, intermediate and highdiversity landscapes. Results from these studies indicate that the area and composition of natural habitats surroundingvineyards can have a significant influence on biological control of E. elegantula. Reduced pestpopulations in more diverse landscapes is thought to be the result of both reduced crop vigor aswell as increased natural enemy impact during the overwintering period. Early seasonpopulations of Anagrus wasps were found in all vineyards regardless of landscape diversity,implying a strong dispersal capacity from overwintering sites. The Anagrus demonstrated astrong density dependent relationship with E. elegantula and this appeared to drive theirdensities in vineyards much more so than changes in landscape diversity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Presentation date: 1995 - 01 - 17 Grape phylloxera, Daktulosp/iaira vitfoliae (Fitch) {{development}} was studied under field and laboratory conditions. The aphid-like insect feeds on Vitis vinfera L. roots producing swellings that decay {{and lead to}} vine decline. The only long-term economic solution for control of grape phylloxera (GP) is to plant vines grafted onto a resistant rootstock, but over 6000 acres of Oregon's wine grapes are planted with root-susceptible V. vinfera cultivars. Ten GP infestations have been verified throughout the state since August 1990. The objective {{of this research was}} to characterize GP development and within-site distribution in <b>Western</b> Oregon. <b>Grape</b> phylloxera were collected from roots dug at two depths (15 - 30 cm and 30 - 45 cm) in three infested vineyards in the Willamette Valley during the summers of 1992 and 1993. A sieve centrifugation method was used to extract GP for counting. The number of eggs, nymphs, n/adults (late-instar), and adults per 30 grams of roots were recorded twice a month. Mean population levels were calculated for each site, sampling date and depth. Population development of GP varied between sites and between dates sampled. Population size appeared to be directly related to soil temperature. The site with the highest overall GP populations had the warmest soil temperatures but the least above-ground symptomatic vine decline ratings. Nymphal population peaks, identified at one site, may correlate with generation time or changes in root and soil environments. Similar numbers of GP were found at both depths sampled, but higher populations were collected from vine roots sampled on the downhill side of an infestation and from vines immediately adjacent to satellite infestations. Sticky-trunk-wraps, placed on the base of vine trunks from June to November at the three sites, collected emerging crawlers (nymphs) and winged-alates in July/August of 1993. Development of GP populations collected from each of the three sites was studied in the laboratory at five constant temperatures (7, 10, 13, 16, and 21 °C). No significant differences in development were observed between the three populations. Grape phylloxera generally did not molt past the nymphal stage at 7, 10, 13, and 16 °C. The first adults appeared before day 35 at 21 °C and this was followed by a significant increase in first generation eggs. In contrast to the laboratory results, eggs were first recovered from field extractions in April/May when mean soil temperatures were 10. 5 to 12. 0 °C in 1993. Eggs were not produced from laboratory populations below 16 °C. These results indicate that either the field conditions allowed GP to develop at lower temperatures or the laboratory assay did not provide sufficient time to full development. The low temperature threshold calculated for zero development from the laboratory assay was 5 °C. A degree day accumulation, which better reflects GP field development, was estimated at 437. 5 using maximum field soil temperatures and a vine development threshold of 10 °C. Further use of degree day models may help to predict generation time of GP...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 During {{summer of}} 1998 and 1999, 34 and 10 {{vineyard}} sites, respectively, were sampled to assess spider mite pests and associated biological control by phytoseiid mites. Vineyards studied spanned five major valleys in <b>western</b> Oregon where <b>grape</b> production occurs. Leaf samples {{were taken from}} site perimeters and centers. One leaf was taken every ten meters of border length, five meters inward from the border to prevent wind-biased or extreme edge effects, while 20 leaves were taken at regular intervals from centers. Variables recorded at each site were: plant age, grape variety, chemical spray information and local vegetation occurring in proximity to vineyards. Sites were categorized as either agricultural or riparian based on what surrounding vegetation type was in the majority. Several parametric and non-parametric tests were used to analyze data, including multiple linear regressions using a computer-based genetic algorithm {{in conjunction with the}} AIC criterion to pre-select a subset of explanatory variables. Typhlodromus pyri was the predominant phytoseiid mite and Tetranychus urticae was the most abundant tetranychid mite sampled. High levels of T. urticae were found when predator densities were very low, and low levels of T. urticae occurred when predator densities were moderate or high. Phytoseiid densities were highest in June and July, while T. urticae densities were highest from August to September. The latter's densities were significantly higher in vineyards surrounded primarily by agriculture, while phytoseiid densities were not significantly different between the two categories. Predatory phytoseiids had significantly higher densities on vineyard edges, while T. urticae densities were higher in vineyard centers. Caneberry, cherry and grape habitats appeared to be sources of predator immigration, while no vegetation type consistently served as a short-range or nearby immigration source for spider mites. Due to insufficient data, pesticide information was not included in multiple linear regression models, although certain chemicals used in vineyards can potentially impact mite populations. Impacts of surrounding vegetation type, grape variety, regional location, plant age, and presence of other mites on phytoseiid and T. urticae densities are discussed...|$|R
