5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded {{that this would be a}} bad idea, as it <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1765, Parliament {{passed the}} Stamp Act which {{required}} colonists {{to pay a}} new tax on most printed materials. News of {{the passage of the}} Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a Stamp Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.|$|E
5|$|San Martín and Belgrano {{met at the}} Yatasto relay. The {{army was}} in poor condition, and San Martín {{initially}} refused to remove Belgrano from the army, as it <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> soldiers' morale. However, the supreme director Gervasio Posadas (who replaced the triumvirate in government) insisted, and San Martín acted as instructed. San Martín stayed {{only a few weeks}} in Tucumán, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain. He also had a positive impression of the guerrilla war waged by Martín Miguel de Güemes against the royalists, similar to the Peninsular War. It was a defensive war, and San Martín trusted that they could prevent a royalist advance in Jujuy.|$|E

50|$|Old Stone Bank {{collapsed}} in the 1980s {{when the federal government}} convinced it to take over two failed savings and loan institutions, but reneged on its promise that it <b>would</b> not <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> bank to do so.|$|R
5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In August 1923, Evans {{participated in}} a Klan parade in the heavily Catholic borough of Carnegie, Pennsylvania, which was {{attacked}} by local residents. One member of the Klan was killed; Evans declared him a martyr and hoped that the death would inspire new recruits. The incident gave a fillip to the Klan's recruitment efforts, but increased Stephenson's animosity toward Evans, on whom he blamed the incident. Stephenson's proclivity for ostentation irritated Evans. Although Stephenson left his official Klan position after a short tenure, under his leadership the Klan's northern supporters had begun to rival those in the South. He had been a skilled campaigner and demagogue, and he remained a well-known advocate of the Klan's platforms after resigning. Evans avoided publicly clashing with him, fearing that it <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> candidacies of Klan-backed politicians: Stephenson was closely involved in the successful gubernatorial candidacy of Indiana Klan-member Edward L. Jackson, and the Klan members had significant electoral gains in that state in 1924, including the election of several candidates to the state legislature. After these victories, Stephenson showed further disdain for Evans.|$|E
5|$|Liniers was {{succeeded by}} Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros {{a few months}} later, who pardoned the mutineers to reduce {{political}} conflicts. Cisneros allowed free trade as well, as instructed by the Junta of Seville, which benefited British merchants; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War. The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> local economy, moral values, social usages, religious practices, and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy. As a result, Cisneros closed trade again, restoring the Spanish monopsony. A group of hacendados (owners of haciendas), who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo, asked Moreno to defend them. Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners, a report that represented the export interest of the landowners, encouraged free trade, and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony. It is considered the most comprehensive economic report {{from the time of}} the viceroyalty. It represented the new European economic ideas, and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled. Several authors have questioned Moreno's authorship of the paper, considering it instead an update of another, previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano, Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers. This report, as well as Moreno's prestige in the colonial society, helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros. Yet secretly, Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy.|$|E

25|$|Klein {{was opposed}} to the Kyoto Accord, since Alberta was a major {{producer}} of oil and natural gas, and he felt that environmental measures <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> economy. The successive government initiated a massive carbon-capture project.|$|E
25|$|As in Perak, this rapid {{development}} attracted great interest from the British in the Straits Settlements. The economy of Selangor became {{important enough to}} the prosperity of the Straits Settlements that any disturbance in that state <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> Straits Settlement itself. Therefore, the British felt they needed to {{have a say in}} Selangor politics. One major disturbance, amounting to a civil war, was the Klang War which began in 1867.|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly a}} year of negotiations, Garbo agreed to renew her {{contract}} with MGM on the condition she would star in Queen Christina and her salary would be increased to $300,000 per film. The film's screenplay had been written by Viertel, and although MGM had been reluctant to make the movie, they relented at Garbo's insistence. For her leading man, MGM suggested Charles Boyer or Laurence Olivier, but Garbo rejected both, preferring her former co-star and lover, John Gilbert. The studio balked {{at the idea of}} casting Gilbert, fearing his declining popularity <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> film's profits, but Garbo prevailed.|$|E

25|$|While Bennett {{supported}} the Conservatives, he opposed Prime Minister Robert Borden's {{proposal for a}} Union Government that would include both Conservatives and Liberals, fearing that this <b>would</b> ultimately <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Party. While he campaigned for Conservative candidates in the 1917 federal election he did not stand for re-election himself.|$|R
25|$|Senator William Jenner {{resigned}} {{shortly before}} the mid-term elections in 1958 and urged Handley to seek his seat. A plan was created where Handley would resign the governorship, his lieutenant would appoint him senator, and he could finish the term. When the plan was revealed to the party leadership, they strongly advised him to not implement the it because they feared it <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> party and {{be perceived as a}} scandal. Handley then decided to have the Secretary of State order an election for the office in November, and Handley himself ran for the position.|$|E
25|$|Springvale School {{was founded}} by Rev. Canon Robert Grinham and Maurice Carver, the founders of Ruzawi School, in 1952, as a second Anglican junior boys' school in Marondera. The school was born of the desire to cater for {{the large number of}} {{children}} on Ruzawi's waiting list which grew to 'epic proportions' in 1945. Canon Grinham fought against the proposal to expand Ruzawi's intake as he felt it <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> ethos of the school, thus pushing forward the idea of establishing another preparatory school. In 1949, the Ruzawi Board bought 1000 acres of land for £2 an acre from Jim Blake, the owner of Springvale Farm.|$|E
25|$|Swamy {{obtained}} Supreme Court Stay {{against the}} implementation of Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP). He believes that it <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> sentiments of {{people who believe that}} this shallow land connecting between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka was built by the Hindu god Rama. He strongly opposes {{the implementation of}} SSSCP citing that implementing this scheme will be a criminal offence under section 295 Indian Penal Code. He wrote letters to Prime Minister of India in June 2009 asking him to stop the project and had informed the Supreme Court on 14 October 2015 that the government may not continue with the Sethusamudram Project.|$|E

25|$|Republican Party Senator Mark Hanna from Ohio, {{himself an}} owner of {{bituminous}} coal mines (not involved in the strike), sought to resolve the strike as it occurred {{less than two months}} before the presidential election. He worked through the National Civic Federation which brought labor and capital representatives together. Relying on J. P. Morgan to convey his message to the industry that a strike <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> reelection of Republican William McKinley, Hanna convinced the owners to concede a wage increase and grievance procedure to the strikers. The industry refused, on the other hand, to formally recognize the UMWA as the representative of the workers. The union declared victory and dropped its demand for union recognition.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Stanton's {{incumbency}} as War Secretary, President Lincoln apportioned {{responsibility for}} the security of government against treachery and other unsavory activities to several members of his cabinet, mostly Secretary Seward, as he did not trust Attorney General Bates or Secretary Cameron. Under Secretary Stanton, the War Department would have consolidated responsibility for internal security. A lynch-pin of Seward's strategy to maintain internal security was the use of arbitrary arrests and detentions, and Stanton continued this practice. Democrats harshly criticized the use of arbitrary arrests, but Lincoln contented that it was his primary responsibility to maintain the integrity and security of the government, and that waiting until possible betrayers committed guilty acts <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> government. At Stanton's behest Seward continued the detention of only the most risky inmates, and released all others.|$|E
25|$|When men {{left their}} factory jobs to fight overseas, women {{stepped up to}} fill their {{positions}} in mass. These jobs became essential during the war when munitions supplies became vital to the war effort. Women excelled in these historically male-dominated roles. Some conservative protesters, rallied against women leaving the home as they argued this <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> traditional family ideals. This was especially true in Quebec, where the strong-arm of the Catholic Church kept many women from working outside the home. The government supported this new essential workforce by creating the first government run daycares. Though women shined in these positions and were even recruited in industrial communities, the jobs remained extremely gendered and women were expected to leave the factories when veterans returned home. Women’s work in factory during the second war {{is the most important}} role played by women on the home front.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, a {{suit filed}} by Paul against {{a plan to}} reapportion and expand the Florida Legislature reached the US Supreme Court. The Court struck down the plan. Paul stated that he had filed the suit because [...] "it <b>would</b> greatly <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> future of Florida to let the Legislature grow to such monstrous {{proportions}} that we would cease to have effective government." ...|$|R

50|$|Snider {{convinced}} the Philadelphia 76ers and Philadelphia Phillies {{to allow the}} channel to televise their home games, after the two teams expressed concern that broadcasting games <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> attendance; <b>the</b> teams' concerns were subsidied when they discovered PRISM broadcasts {{had no effect on}} the number of spectators who attended their respective games at The Spectrum and Veterans Stadium and helped them earn additional revenue from carrying the home game telecasts.|$|R
25|$|When the Allies {{contemplated}} turning Klaipėda into a free {{city like}} Danzig, Polish Foreign Minister Konstanty Skirmunt believed {{that such a}} free city <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> Polish interest by allowing Germany to maintain its influence in the region. Skirmunt instead supported {{the transfer of the}} region to Lithuania if Poland would secure unrestricted trade via the Neman River and the port. At the same time Poland was preoccupied by other issues (assassination of President Gabriel Narutowicz, economic crisis, territorial disputes in Silesia, tense relations with Soviet Russia) and paid less attention to Klaipėda. Lithuania understood that a military action against Polish interest in the region could resume the Polish–Lithuanian War. To counter the expected backlash from Poland and France, the Lithuanians looked for an ally in Soviet Russia, which opposed a strong Polish state. On November 29, Soviet Foreign Minister Georgy Chicherin stopped briefly in Kaunas on his way to Berlin. In a conversation with Galvanauskas, Chicherin expressed support for Lithuanian plans in Klaipėda and declared that Soviet Russia would not remain passive if Poland moved against Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|Political {{complications}} {{began to}} interfere with the project. Celebrezze had not involved in the council in the negotiations, and the city council now threatened to balk at the approving the project. Celebrezze wanted to establish a group of businessmen and civic leaders to promote the bond issue to voters (who had a habit of defeating such referendums), but had to hold off until the council acted. This placed passage of the bond issue in jeopardy. Moreover, the two consultants hired earlier that summer had yet to issue their report. The city council appeared supportive of the project, but this soon changed. Councilman Russell withdrew his competing proposal for a convention center, after being convinced by other council members that competing plans <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> bond issue vote. But the council declined to support the group promoting the bond issue. This angered John A. Green, chairman of Ohio Bell, whom Celebrezze had asked to lead the promotional group. Green announced he would not do so unless disputes over the convention center were resolved.|$|E
500|$|Joseph and Prince Kaunitz {{arranged}} the First Partition of Poland despite Maria Theresa's protestations. Her {{sense of justice}} pushed her to reject the idea of partition, which <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> Polish people. The duo {{argued that it was}} too late to abort now. Besides, Maria Theresa herself agreed with the partition when she realised that Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia would do it with or without Austrian participation. Maria Theresa claimed and eventually took Galicia and Lodomeria, a province claimed by Hungarian monarchs since the 13thcentury; in the words of Frederick, [...] "the more she cried, the more she took".|$|E
50|$|According to {{economic}} experts canvassed by PolitiFact, the tariffs could help create new manufacturing jobs {{and lead to}} some concessions from the U.S.'s foreign trading partners, but consumer costs and production costs would almost certainly rise, the stock market would fall, interest rates could rise, and trade wars could occur. PolitiFact noted that lower-income consumers in the United States <b>would</b> be <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> most.|$|R
