40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} effect of {{instruction}} in the use of request linguistic realisations by 160 female learners of English as a foreign language. All participants were engaged in an English for Academic Purposes course. Data were collected by means of a pre-test and post-test distributed before and after a training period that lasted one semester. Learners' performance denoted the positive effects of explicit instruction in the use of request strategies, thus coinciding with findings from previous studies (Tateyama et al., 1997). Results from the present study also lead to further research in settings <b>where</b> <b>English</b> <b>is</b> <b>learnt</b> as a foreign language and where learners lack the chances to be exposed to authentic pragmatic input...|$|E
30|$|The {{construction}} {{and implementation of}} such a national framework will necessitate substantial research and strategic planning to form a coherent theory and systematic practice of English language education specific to the Chinese context. English teaching, learning and assessment in China will hopefully benefit from {{the process of developing}} such a framework of reference. The project is also hoped to promote cooperation among educational institutions and facilitate communication between educational institutions and government organizations. In addition, the project is intended to contribute to the debate on whether a common European framework (i.e., the CEFR) would suffice for language education worldwide, whether local versions of the CEFR (e.g., the CEFR-J) should be developed, or whether new frameworks (e.g., the CSE) should be developed and implemented in a country <b>where</b> <b>English</b> <b>is</b> taught, <b>learnt</b> and used as a foreign language.|$|R
40|$|Non-native or {{indigenous}} English {{teachers have}} provided the largest teaching and professional support in Asian countries <b>where</b> <b>English</b> <b>is</b> taught and <b>learnt</b> in school as an additional or international language. As the language environment outside classroom in these countries is generally poor, teachers become {{a major source of}} language input for learners. This article explores the Lexical Variation (LV) ratio of non-native teacher talk and the percentage of words teachers used at different vocabulary levels to determine the lexical richness in a foreign language classroom. The classroom data revealed that teachers’ oral input failed to provide a lexically rich environment as the teacher talk were limited in both variation and frequency range. Ways to enhance the lexical environment will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Practically, every Indonesian is bilingual {{as he or}} {{she speaks}} one vernacular (local language) and Indonesian. Moreover in the field of education, the educated people may speak more than two languages. Therefore, they have the {{tendency}} to switch to other codes or languages. This study examines: (1) what languages are mainly code switched by the teachers when they are conveying the lessons in the classroom and (2) why the teachers switch from one code to another. The theories underlying this thesis are Sociolinguistics, Bilingualism, and Code Switching. As every person is bilingual, therefore; he or she tends to switch to another code influenced by social factors i. e who is the speaker, what is the topic, why is the topic delivered, where, and when the conversation takes place. Using a tape recorder (Casio), the writer records three speeches (all of them are in formal situations), then transcribes and analyzes them under given parameters (such as The languages used, Setting and Scene, Participants, Ends, Act sequences, Key, Instrumentalities, and Norms). Based on the data analyzed, it is found out that the languages mostly code switched <b>are</b> first <b>English</b> and Indonesian, second Indonesian and Javanese. This order shows the degree of their occurances and frequency from the most to the least. The main reason that make the teachers switch their codes are (1) to clarify their messages, (2) to make a joke/to make the situation less formal and relaxing, (3) to communicate with their students, and (4) to change the topic. There are other factors that {{play an important role in}} the code switching process: (1) personal emotions of the speakers who switch their codes. In other words, the speakers cannot control their English consistently when they are rather upset and it leads them to change the topic, (2) the fact of being bilinguals also make the teachers feel free to switch their codes during the speeches especially they have a close relationship with their students (3) the other parameters also influence the existence of code switching. This is a preliminary study of the code switching which exists in the classroom <b>where</b> <b>English</b> <b>is</b> still <b>learnt</b> as a foreign language; it is far from perfect. There are many shortcomings in terms of scope, instruments and techniques of data analysis. Therefore, it is suggested that: (a) future research of code switching be done, use more sophisticated instruments and more varied data (b) more languages to be used to deliver lessons in the classes is a great help as the students indirectly got some new vocabularies. Therefore, it is proper to be carried out...|$|R
40|$|The ‘Three-circle Model’ (Quirk et al. 1972; Kachru 1992), one of {{the most}} {{influential}} models accounting for the spread of English world-wide in terms of the three concentric circles –the Inner Circle, the Outer Circle and the Expanding Circle – though still an important stepping stone for the grouping of varieties of Englishes, does not seem to be sufficiently dynamic to reflect the reality of today’s uses English in the world (Rajadurai 2005). In particular, Kachru’s tripartite model disregards the new dominant function and status of English as a lingua franca (ELF) between speakers who do not share a mother tongue. In many cases <b>English</b> <b>is</b> also spoken by both migrants community and Expanding Circle host societies – Italy being a case in point – is often the only way to (partially) overcome linguistic barriers, be it in the workplace, in their neighborhood, at school, at in the offices of the local administration, and so on. Additionally, not only EFL still needs to be defined more precisely, but the classification between the Circles themselves cannot be clear-cut, due to current ceaseless “population movement, language loss, divergent language attitudes, and massive shifts in language” (Crystal, 1995 : 363). From this viewpoint it has become virtually impossible to provide workable distinctions between ‘native speakers’ and ‘non-native speaker’ as well (Davies 2003). Furthermore, research on the use of English as a lingua franca in Europe, <b>where</b> <b>English</b> <b>is</b> not only <b>learnt,</b> but more widely used in different settings, has highlighted a new variety of English - sometimes also controversially called ‘Euro-English’ (Mollin, 2006), to be found ≪not only in restricted fields such as business and commerce, but also in a wide range of other contexts of communication including its increasing use as a language of socialisation≫ (Jenkins 2003 : 38). In this perspective, our investigation tries to account for the uses of English by a group of migrants based inCastel Volturno (a small Southern Italian town nearby Naples). We administered a self-assessment questionnaire survey aiming to gauge to what extent the use of English enable(d) these migrants to engage with people in the Italian receiving society and promote effective mutual interaction. The results and their implications are discussed in the paper...|$|R
