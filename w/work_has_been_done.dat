5|$|Since its inception, {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars have been poured into the Auburn Dam project, but no further <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> since the 1980s. However, the Bureau of Reclamation continues to list the Auburn as a considered alternative for the future of its Auburn-Folsom South Unit project. As of now, massive evidence of the dam's construction still remain in the North Fork American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the abutments and spillway, with the consequences of increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|Some of the 62 known {{satellites}} of Saturn {{are considered}} lost {{because they have}} not been observed since their discovery and hence their orbits are not well-known enough to pinpoint their current locations. <b>Work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to recover many of them in surveys from 2009 onwards, but seven – S/2007 S 2, S/2004 S 13, S/2006 S 1, S/2007 S 3, S/2004 S 17, S/2004 S 12, and S/2004 S 7 – still remain lost today.|$|E
5|$|The site can be visited, {{although}} little restoration <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to it. Various temple pyramids, {{the remains}} of palaces (mostly reduced to mounds of rubble) and a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame {{can be seen in}} the site core. In the Greater Q'umarkaj area there were four ballcourts, one in each of the four major political divisions of the city, testifying to the central role of the ballgame ritual in the sociopolitical organisation of the city.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{paradigm in}} TDA {{is often referred}} as sublevel persistence. Apart from multidimensional persistence, many <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to extend this special case.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} {{noteworthy}} for its relief sculpture. Around the window casings, vegetal and geometric patterns may be found. Some restoration <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> {{to the church}} in 1940.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Stanford {{returned}} {{to find that}} no new <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on the engine and when informed {{of the events that}} transpired, Crocker's orders were countermanded in no uncertain terms.|$|R
5|$|The usual form of {{diamond in}} cutting tools is micrometer-sized grains {{dispersed}} {{in a metal}} matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools {{can be found in}} mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.|$|E
5|$|Some of the 69 known {{satellites}} of Jupiter {{are considered}} lost {{because they have}} not been observed since their discovery and hence their orbits are not well-known enough to pinpoint their current locations. <b>Work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to recover many of them in surveys from 2009 onwards (in which some new moons were also discovered), but six – S/2003 J 12, S/2003 J 10, S/2003 J 19, S/2003 J 4, S/2003 J 2, and S/2011 J 1 – still remain lost today. Follow-up observations in 2018 are planned to secure their orbits and perhaps find new moons.|$|E
5|$|The work of E. A. Wallis Budge, Birch's {{successor}} at the British Museum, {{is still}} in wide circulation – including both his hieroglyphic editions and his English translations of the Papyrus of Ani, though the latter are now considered inaccurate and out-of-date. More recent translations in English have been published by T. G. Allen (1974) and Raymond O. Faulkner (1972). As more <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on the Book of the Dead, more spells have been identified, and the total now stands at 192.|$|E
60|$|No {{one seemed}} {{disposed}} {{to take advantage}} of this very generous offer; now that his particular portion of the <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> it <b>was</b> very much as if every one save Isaac ignored him.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{stated that}} his {{business}} {{was to show}} that his <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> right, {{and he had the}} figures to prove it. Mr. Lee replied that the survey was poor and would <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> over.|$|R
30|$|In 1990, the {{nonlinear}} backward stochastic {{differential equation}} (BSDE in short) {{was introduced by}} Pardoux and Peng [1]. Until now, it has had applications in many fields, such as partial differential equation (see [2]), stochastic control (see [3, 4]) and mathematical finance (see [5]). Meanwhile, BSDE itself <b>has</b> <b>been</b> developed to many different branches, such as BSDE with jumps (see [6 – 8]), mean-field BSDE (see [9]), time-delayed BSDE (see [10 – 12]), anticipated BSDEs (see [13, 14]) and so on. A lot of <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> for the control problem of such BSDEs. However, fewer <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on the control problems of stochastic delayed systems.|$|R
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of secular music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, for from three to six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E
25|$|Since 1980, more {{systematic}} <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> {{in an effort}} to identify more Bradshaw rock art sites in the Kimberley.|$|E
5|$|Although {{foundational}} <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on {{the philosophy}} of postanarchism by radical theorists such as Andrew Koch and Todd May, From Bakunin to Lacan introduced a slightly different and more substantive formulation of the theory.|$|R

50|$|At some point, Chaussegros de Léry {{produced}} a finished {{copy of a}} map of the west. The original <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by Christopher Dufrost de La Jemeraye, a nephew of Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye.|$|R
5|$|By 1807, further {{investigation}} revealed two new {{objects in the}} region: Juno and Vesta. The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars, where {{the main body of}} <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> brought this first period of discovery to a close.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of Scarpati’s photography <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> {{in the music}} industry, having worked on hundreds of album covers and photo shoots across different genres. He has worked with many famous musical artists, such as Rush, Def Leppard, Warrant and Kenny Rogers.|$|E
25|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1866 the wall paintings have been variously restored and conserved in 1900–01, 1936, 1950, 1961–63 and 1986. They {{have suffered from}} moisture and salts. Much <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to improve the drainage and the exterior rendering of the church.|$|E
