50|$|A back-illuminated sensor {{contains}} the same elements, but arranges the wiring behind the photocathode layer by flipping the silicon wafer during manufacturing and then thinning its reverse side so that light can strike the photocathode layer without {{passing through the}} <b>wiring</b> <b>layer.</b> This change can improve the chance of an input photon being captured from about 60% to over 90%, with the greatest difference realised when pixel size is small, as the light capture area gained in moving the wiring from the top (light incident) to bottom surface (paraphrasing the BSI design) is proportionately smaller for a larger pixel. BSI-CMOS sensors are most advantageous in partial sun and other low light conditions. Placing the wiring behind the light sensors {{is similar to the}} difference between a cephalopod eye and a vertebrate eye. Orienting the active matrix transistors behind the photocathode layer can lead to a host of problems, such as cross-talk, which causes noise, dark current, and color mixing between adjacent pixels. Thinning also makes the silicon wafer more fragile. These problems could be solved through improved manufacturing processes, but only at the cost of lower yields, and consequently higher prices. Despite these issues, early BI sensors found uses in niche roles where their better low-light performance was important. Early uses included industrial sensors, security cameras, microscope cameras and astronomy systems.|$|E

Factors, such as lack of physical space, budgetary constraints, conflicting needs of different courses, and rapid obsolescence of computing technology, precipitate this challenge. While introductory computing courses can be adequately supported through general labs, advanced computing courses typically require dedicated labs. Normally, however, even a dedicated lab must simultaneously support multiple courses with diverse support requirements. Consequently, in designing dedicated computing labs, versatility and flexibility of the lab must be the prime consideration. Drawing on the insights gained from developing a dedicated lab, the authors present a model for developing a versatile, flexible lab to support computer network courses.

40|$|Functional yield is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the percentage of dies on a wafer that are not affected by catastrophic defects. Within the interconnect these defects are usually caused by particle contamination and are divided into bridging defects, which join adjacent wires and cuts, which result in broken wires. Functional yield is therefore determined by the geometry of the routing channels, how these channels are filled with wire and the distribution of defect sizes. Since the wire spacing and width are usually fixed and the distribution of defects within a mature production facility is well known, the problem reduces to estimating individual wire lengths for cuts and to estimating the overlapping distance that two wires share in neighboring sections of the routing grid for bridges. Previous work in this area has analyzed the problem by assuming that all wiring tracks are occupied with wire, leading to overestimates for the probability of failure due to both cuts and bridges. This paper utilizes statistical models of the placement/routing process to provide a more realistic approach for cut and bridge yield estimation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{building}} a two level nanostructures with planarization technique. A major technological challenge for the applications of various kinds of nano- electronics {{is the ability to}} interconnect the very small structures. In fact, the interconnect problem is much more formidable than the problem of fabricating nano structures, but receives far less attention in research. The objective of this project was to evaluate a generic process for isolating and connecting together nanoscale circuit elements which are based on a vertical stack structure. The fabrication of pure, single crystal materials and stacks is often the starting point for high quality nano-scale circuit elements. However, the contacting to these stacks and connection in to a circuit is a difficult problem which is common to many nano-electronic studies. Development of such a process could help groups working Ferro electric memories, spin transport (MRAM), and quantum Josephson junction circuits.

The Fraunhofer Institute has enabled a complete roll-to-roll manufactured polymer-opto-chemical-electronic module on a foil substrate, wherein an electroluminescent light source has been hetero-integrated together with an organic TFT, working as a photo-detector. A chemically sensitive, colour changing film is sandwiched in between the two elements to form an optical detection system for volatile analytes such as amines. The setup, henceforth referred to as the "PolyOpto" module, comprises of a dye coated layer that can detect specific chemical reactions by colour change inserted in between the EL light source and the OTFT photo-detector. A hole is laser cut through the system to allow the sensor layer to come in contact with the gases, which then through a chemical reaction, chang es colour and initiates a different response in the output of the organic transistor. Hence, this allows for a disposable chemo-analytical system {{that can be used in}} various application fields. As compared to conventional systems, the advantage here lies in the direct integration of the different functionalities without any advanced assembly steps, simultaneous use of coatings for both components (transparent electrode and <b>wiring</b> <b>layer)</b> and roll-to-roll compatibility, thus rendering a disposable system.

The process was based on the doubly-planarized all-refractory technology for superconductive circuits (DPARTS) process currently used to fabricate these devices at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and streamlined by removing or replacing the most time-consuming steps and several optical layers. In addition, 248 -nm (deep-UV) photolithography was employed {{for the first time in}} a Nb-based process, with the goal of improving resolution past that achievable by standard i-line lithography. The process has five optical <b>layers,</b> two <b>wiring</b> <b>layers,</b> and a via layer, and is intended to be used for rapid-turnaround evaluation of simple circuits requiring only two <b>wiring</b> <b>layers.</b> Anodization was used to produce a 50 nm film of NbOx to isolate the <b>wiring</b> <b>layers,</b> replacing the time-consuming oxide deposition and planarization used in the DPARTS process.

40|$|New {{technology}} for superconductor integrated circuits {{has been developed}} and is presented. It employs diffusion stoplayers (DSLs) to protect Josephson junctions (JJs) from interlayer migration of impurities, improve JJ critical current (Ic) targeting and reproducibility, eliminate aging, and eliminate pattern-dependent effects in Ic and tunneling characteristics of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb junctions in integrated circuits. The latter effects were recently found in Nb-based JJs integrated into multilayered digital circuits. E. g., {{it was found that}} Josephson critical current density (Jc) may depend on the JJ's environment, on the type and size of metal layers making contact to niobium base (BE) and counter electrodes (CE) of the junction, and also change with time. Such Jc variations within a circuit reduce circuit performance and yield, and restrict integration scale. This variability of JJs is explained as caused by hydrogen contamination of Nb layers during wafer processing, which changes the height and structural properties of AlOx tunnel barrier. Redistribution of hydrogen impurities between JJ electrodes and other circuit layers by diffusion along Nb wires and through contacts between layers causes long-term drift of Jc. At least two DSLs are required to completely protect JJs from impurity diffusion effects - right below the junction BE and right above the junction CE. The simplest and the most technologically convenient DSLs we have found are thin (from 3 nm to 10 nm) layers of Al. They were deposited in-situ under the BE layer, thus forming an Al/Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb penta-layer, and under the first <b>wiring</b> <b>layer</b> to junctions' CE, thus forming an Al/Nb wiring bi-layer. A significant improvement of Jc uniformity on 150 -mm wafer has also been obtained along with large improvements in Jc targeting and run-to-run reproducibility.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of conventional power electronics packaging reaches from SMD packages for power chips to large power modules. In {{most of these}} packages the power semiconductors are connected by bond wires, resulting in large resistances and parasitic inductances. Power chip packages have to carry semiconductors with increasing current densities. Conventional wire bonds are limiting their performance. Today's power modules are based on DCB (Direct Copper bonded) ceramic substrates. IGBT switches are mounted onto the ceramic and their top side contacts are connected by thick Al wires. This allows one <b>wiring</b> <b>layer</b> only and makes an integration of driver chips very difficult. Additionally, bond wires result in a high stray inductance which limits the switching frequency. Especially {{for the use of}} ultra-fast switching semiconductors, like SiC and GaN, {{it is very difficult to}} realize low inductive packages. A new approach for embedded power modules will be presented, which can cover different application fields, ranging from 50 W over 500 W to 50 kW power modules for different applications like single chip packages, over power control units for pedelec (Pedal Electric Cycle), to inverter modules for automotive applications.

Moreover, the realized microhardness tests indicate a reliable homogeneity of the strength properties featuring the steel along the wire section. On the other hand, the fractographic analysis clearly indicates that the source of the failure mechanism is the initiation of the cracks in the surface of the z-shaped wire of the outer <b>wire</b> <b>layer</b> in contact with the wires of the inner layer. The coupling of the different results seems to indicate that the most probable cause of the failure mechanism has {{to be found in the}} excessive pressure applied on the rope and to the consequent sliding between the external <b>wire</b> <b>layer</b> and the inner adjacent one that produces debris and the nucleation of the crack...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a quantum wire {{intermediate}} band, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, on the optical and electrical properties of solar cells are reported. To investigate {{the behavior of the}} intermediate band, the quantum wires were remotely doped at three different doping concentrations, the number of quantum <b>wire</b> <b>layers</b> was varied from three to twenty, and the solar cell structure was optimized. For all the structures, current-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements were performed to examine the effect of absorption and power conversion of the intermediate band solar cell (IBSC). Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements showed that Î´-doping can increase the lifetime of the excited electrons in the quantum wires. The quantum efficiency measurements revealed that the quantum wires extend the absorption spectrum in the infrared and produce a photocurrent by absorption of photons with energies below the GaAs band gap energy. In addition, the quantum wire intermediate band solar cell increased the solar conversion efficiency by 13. 3 % over the reference cell. An increase in the quantum efficiency was observed by increasing the number of quantum <b>wire</b> <b>layers</b> in the intermediate band. Furthermore, by optimizing the solar cell structure, the quantum efficiency and solar power conversion efficiency were substantially improved. Finally, temperature dependent current-voltage measurements reveal that the quantum wire intermediate band does not degrade the temperature sensitivity of the device. This research shows the potential for a quantum wire intermediate band as a viable option for creating higher efficiency solar cell devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{enhanced}} directed emission from a metasurface {{which is}} illuminated at its resonance frequency by a dipole source is experimentally demonstrated. The metasurface {{consists of two}} cutwire layers and a continuous <b>wire</b> <b>layer</b> in between, which exhibits strong magnetic dipole resonance under excitation normal to the plane. The scanned near-field patterns show the confinement of {{the field in the}} presence of metasurface, which, in turn, provides an enhanced and directional radiation in the far field. The far-field patterns are obtained by direct measurement and by a far-field transformation of the scanned near field, which are found to be in good agreement.

40|$|Modern VLSI {{processing}} {{supports a}} two-dimensional surface for active devices along with multiple stacked layers of interconnect. With {{the advent of}} planarization, the number of layers can be large (6 or 7 in modern designs) and more layers are feasible if the cost is justified. Using a multilayer-wiring VLSI area model, we show how a butterfly fat-tree (or fat-pyramid) with N processors can be laid out in #(N) active device area using #(log(N)) <b>wiring</b> <b>layers.</b> This result may have practical value in laying out efficient, singlechip multiprocessors and FPGAs. It may also provide a theoretical basis for the rate of layer scaling empirically seen in VLSI designs...|$|R
