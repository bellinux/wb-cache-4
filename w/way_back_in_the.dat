5|$|The {{following}} day, 15 April, he flew {{his final}} sortie with 65 Squadron flying support for 266 Squadron and 402 Squadron. On the <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon he claimed one Bf 109 destroyed. This, his fifth victory, {{made him an}} official fighter ace. However, according to other accounts, only two Bf 109s {{were involved in the}} brief air battle. Finucane's and 65's likely opponents in the battle was Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Jagdgeschwader 26 and future General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighter Forces). Galland had taken off with his wingman and a crate containing lobster loaded into the fuselage of his Bf 109 to deliver to Jagdfliegerführer 2 Theo Osterkamp for his birthday at Luftflotte 2 headquarters. En route, Galland took a detour over the English coast and attacked several flights of Spitfires, claiming two 266 squadrons shot down. Galland's landing-gear fell down during the battle, possibly leading Finucane to claim it as destroyed. Both German pilots returned to France, their machines undamaged. Finucane was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 25 April.|$|E

So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up, and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E

500|$|Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum cited The Seventh Victim as his {{favorite}} horror film; {{it is the}} only horror movie on his list of 100 favorite movies. Film historian Carlos Clarens also praised the film, noting: [...] "Rarely has a film succeeded so well in capturing the nocturnal menace of a large city, the terror underneath the everyday, the suggestion of hidden evil," [...] and deemed it [...] "hauntingly oppressive." [...] In Guide for the Film Fanatic, critic Danny Peary wrote that The Seventh Victim is [...] "a complete original, a cult film in England <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forties. It features bizarre and sinister characters (i.e. a one-armed female devil-worshipper who plays piano), smart, strong-willed women, and several scary scenes... The double suicide [...] that ends the film is perhaps the most baffling, depressing moment in all horror films." ...|$|E

A film {{critic for the}} Los Angeles Examiner said that [...] "not since I {{reviewed}} the first Chaplin comedies <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-reel days has Charlie given us such an orgy of laughs." [...] The New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall considered it [...] "a film worked out with admirable artistry". Variety declared it was [...] "not Chaplin's best picture" [...] but that certain sequences were [...] "hilarious." [...] The New Yorker wrote that it was [...] "on the order of his other , perhaps {{a little better than}} any of them" [...] and that it gave an impression [...] "not often - oh, very seldom - found in the movies; an indefinable impression perhaps best described as a quality of charm." [...] On the other hand, Alexander Bakshy of The Nation was highly critical of City Lights, objecting to the silent format and over-sentimentality and describing it as [...] "Chaplin's feeblest".|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} review, Billboard called the record [...] "short, to the point, and bristling with attitude," [...] and {{predicted}} it would poise the band for commercial breakthrough. In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone Neva Chonin wrote, [...] "It's all harmless but still gnarly enough to foment {{the kind of}} anti-everything rebellion that spawned rock & roll <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic desbribed it as a [...] "fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release." [...] Kerrang! wrote that the album includes [...] "enough energy, attitude and cracking songs here to ensure that blink {{will be remembered for}} more than just onstage nudity." [...] The catchy, pop sensibility of the album was praised by Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club, describing the band as finding success within a [...] "well-worn genre" [...] (punk rock). The New York Times also designated the record its 'Album of the Week'. The record did have its detractors: British music publication New Musical Express (NME) gave the record a very poor review, calling the record despicable, [...] "wholly toothless and soulless" [...] and deriding the band as [...] "as bad, as meaningless, as the cock-rockers and hippy wankers punk originally sought to destroy." ...|$|E

500|$|Some critics felt season 13 was an {{improvement}} over the previous Scully seasons. DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of it goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E
