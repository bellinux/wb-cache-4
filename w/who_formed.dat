5|$|In {{assessing}} {{the work of}} Tkach, there are two points of view. The critics of Tkach, especially those <b>who</b> <b>formed</b> the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for {{the collapse of the}} WCG. They believe that the changes he brought were a turn against God and say his rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation.|$|E

The Cloud Club was a compromise between William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kharrat {{was born}} to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861, during Ottoman rule in Syria.
