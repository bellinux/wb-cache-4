5|$|Each road stage (that is, all {{the stages}} except the team time {{trial and the}} {{individual}} time trial) included an intermediate sprint. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> where the leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification. Many of the stages also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification, with the most difficult climbs earning the most points.|$|E

5|$|In a December 26 practice, Virginia Tech linebacker Myron Newsome {{suffered}} an ankle injury {{that threatened to}} force him to sit out the Orange Bowl. Newsome, who had been a starter during the regular season, eventually recovered to participate in the game, but his injury <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of media interest in the days prior to kickoff. Two other Virginia Tech defenders were injured during practice prior to the game. Cornell Brown suffered a minor leg injury, while defensive end John Engelberger broke his nose.|$|E
5|$|Perched on an {{isolated}} rocky eminence, inaccessible on three sides, the fortress overlooks Split, the ancient Roman settlement of Salona, Solin, Kaštela and Trogir, {{and most of}} the central Dalmatian islands. Historically, the fortress has controlled access to and from Bosnia, Dalmatia and inland Croatia. The importance of such a position was felt by every army that invaded, or held possession of this part of Croatia. Klis Fortress <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> against which their attacks were always directed, and it has been remarkable for the many sieges it withstood. It has been of major strategic value in Croatia throughout history.|$|E
5|$|The TVR {{line would}} {{dominate}} the transportation of coal throughout the Rhondda's industrial history, and its monopoly <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of contention, as with no rivals the colliery owners could not negotiate for haulage rates. Several {{attempts were made}} to break the monopoly including the opening of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, between 1885 and 1895, which linked Blaenrhondda {{at the head of the}} Rhondda Fawr to the Prince of Wales Dock. To achieve this rail link the Rhondda Tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to Blaengwynfi; at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.|$|E

5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|The Clock Tower {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception across its history. In retrospective reviews, the first title, Clock Tower (1995), received praise for its haunting atmosphere but {{was criticized for}} tedious puzzles and exploration. Despite these criticisms, it is considered instrumental in establishing the survival horror genre and a creating a model for future horror games to follow. Its sequel, Clock Tower (1996), was met with mixed reception as well. The horror themes and atmosphere were well received, but the game's point-and-click gameplay and slow pace {{were found to be}} inferior to the growing landscape of action games on the PlayStation, especially Capcom's first Resident Evil title, which was released the same year. The third title, Clock Tower II, was met with unfavorable reviews. Critics heavily criticized the slow point-and-click interface and the flawed trial-and-error gameplay. Clock Tower 3 received similar reviews to the first two titles. The graphics, atmosphere and storyline received positive reviews, but again, the gameplay <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of criticism. Critics believed the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were weak.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E
