40|$|Abstract: Engineering {{estimates}} for the prediction of fatigue life is an important consideration {{at the design stage}} of components. Conventional approach of dimensioning against cyclic load-ing consists of comparing the stress amplitudes against the life time. Similarly, when a compo-nent is under high loading, a strain-life methodology is adopted. In both cases, extensive experimental efforts are required for obtaining the stress-life or strain-life curves. Therefore, it is important to develop amethodology for obtaining the fatigue life of amaterial to obtain a basic fatigue life data for design engineers. This study focuses on the fatigue life of amaterial in the region of low cycle fatigue. Amethod is proposed for obtaining an estimate for the fatigue life of material under high loading from the results of the high cycle fatigue and static properties of the material within the stress-based diagram.

40|$|Air-centres {{are the key}} {{components}} of automotive heat exchangers taking into account heat transfer requirements and air pressure drop. In other words, their main goal {{is to provide a}} sufficient surface needed to transfer heat with minimum pressure drop of an airside. The air-centres are thin-walled structures made of <b>wrought</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> with a ratio between a minimum dimension and a thickness at least of 85. In addition, they create a necessary structural support for heat exchanger tubes and thanks to them a heat exchanger cores have a required structural resistance. The current heat exchanger structural designs were developed based on ground of many years’ developments having regard to field failures and complex manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, there are still design issues, which need to be clarified {{and one of them is}} the structural design requirements of the air centres. The goal of this paper is to show importance of the post-buckling resistance of the air-centres on the overall structural integrity of the heat-exchanger core. The work is focused on the post-buckling behaviour of the air-centres taking into consideration different material properties in an elasto-plastic range and the different thickness. Both parameters have influence on stress level in the heat-exchangers tubes. The varying stresses in the tubes are main roots of field failure of the heat exchangers. The buckled shapes of the air centres cause the reduction of the tube stiffness supports. Thus, they causes high tube stresses, which in turn reduce significantly field lifetime of the heat exchangers. The problem is very much practical due to continuous trend on nowadays-automotive market to decrease the thickness of components of heat exchangers in order to cut cost of final products. Unfortunately, there is not a clear limit of the thickness reduction considering the strength (pressure resistance) of the core. In addition, the strength material requirements are not visibly defined in terms of the overall pressure core resistance. This work is going to bring some estimation of the thickness and the material strength requirements of the air centres taking into consideration the complex buckling problem.
