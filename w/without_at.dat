5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E

25|$|Unicomp {{currently}} produces Model M's with USB connectors {{that can}} be connected directly to modern PCs. However, earlier Model M's have either AT or PS/2 connectors, requiring adapters for PCs lacking those capabilities. (PS/2-to-USB adapters exist for computers without PS/2 ports; and additional AT-to-PS/2 adapters, or SDL-to-PS/2 cables, for computers <b>without</b> <b>AT</b> ports.) Some PS/2-to-USB adapters are unreliable with early Model M's that require more power than the adapters can provide.|$|E

25|$|Thus {{by the end}} of the 1850s, the GNR {{had gained}} access to most of West Yorkshire, {{although}} <b>without</b> <b>at</b> this time owning any lines beyond Askern Junction, a few miles north of Doncaster. The profits gained from the coal traffic from this area to London prompted the Great Eastern Railway and Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to promote a bill for a trunk line from Doncaster through Lincolnshire, but this was rejected by Parliament in both 1865 and 1871.|$|E

In an effort to correct this, draft horse stallions were put to use, but the result was merely a loss of the identifiable type. To regain the utilitarian warmblood type, which differed from the older coach horse type due to the advent of the steam locomotive, suitable horses were purchased from Hannover. As a result of the regular exchange of breeding stock, Mecklenburgers and Hanoverians remained similar to one another, and distinctly different from the heavier Oldenburgers and Holsteiners.|$|E

25|$|As Germany {{scheduled}} its {{invasion of}} Poland for August 25 {{and prepared for}} war with France, German war planners in August estimated that, because of massive oil, food and rubber shortfalls, {{in the face of}} an expected British blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only supplier for many items. Every internal German military and economic study had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least Soviet neutrality. By August 10, the countries worked out the last minor technical details, but the Soviets delayed signing the economic agreement for almost ten days until they were sure that they had also reached a political agreement.|$|E
25|$|In sales & trading, {{quantitative}} analysts work {{to determine}} prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically {{this was a}} distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, {{and it is now}} difficult to enter trading as a profession <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of algorithmic trading it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.|$|E
25|$|Despite the variability, all {{but four}} presidents {{have been able}} to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, though his {{successor}} (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction {{in the size of the}} Court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Somewhat similarly, presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one full term has gone <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least one opportunity to make an appointment.|$|E

25|$|The Nyasaland {{government}} had imprisoned Banda, not realising {{that he was}} the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda, unlike other Congress leaders, was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Had Devlin found there was a murder plot and that Banda had encouraged violence, this would have been very difficult. Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached by Macleod for advice. The Royal Commission {{on the future of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (the Monckton Commission) toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given limited terms of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the African nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that African nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation.|$|E
25|$|The same report {{noted that}} the low Great Lakes levels were drought-induced, caused by a very hot, dry summer {{and a lack of}} a solid snowpack in the winter of 2012. At the time of the report, December 2012, Lake Michigan-Huron was 28 inches below its {{long-term}} average which is near the record lows of 1964. Historic lake levels for Lake Michigan reported from 1918 to 1998 show that the low levels observed in 1964 were the lowest since 1918. In 2012 Lake Michigan-Huronâs seasonal rise was about 4 inches where it usually is about 12 inches. Normally the Chicago River water level is two feet lower than the lake and therefore does not flow into the lake. If the lake level falls too low threatening to reverse the river flow, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago would be forced to close locks between the lake and river {{for longer periods of time}} limiting navigation. A reversal flow of the Chicago River into Lake Michigan would have a negative impact on navigation and on the quality of Lake Michigan water which is the source of drinking water. Chicago's raw sewage in the river is normally carried upstream toward the Mississippi River which flows south towards the Gulf of Mexico. On January 9, 2013 Chicago meteorologists announced 320 days <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least one inch of snowfall. Water levels in the lake started to level off with the river and sewage was visible at the cusp of the locks, just a few hundred feet from Lake Michigan. David St. Pierre, executive director of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago warned the low lake levels were nearing a point of real concern. However, the District maintains that it is not possible for the River to reverse due to low lake level alone.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E

500|$|Political {{literature}} became Johnson's mainstay in the 1790s: {{he published}} 118 works, which amounted to 57% of his total political output. As Chard notes, [...] "hardly a year went by <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least one anti-war and one anti-slave trade publication from Johnson". In particular, Johnson published abolitionist works, such as minister and former slave-ship captain John Newton's Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade (1788), Barbauld's Epistle to William Wilberforce (1791), and Captain John Gabriel Stedman's Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796) (with illustrations by Blake). Most importantly he {{helped organize the}} publication of The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789), the autobiography of former slave Olaudah Equiano.|$|E
500|$|The Suez Crisis very {{publicly}} exposed Britain's {{limitations to}} the world and confirmed Britain's decline on the world stage, demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the United States. The events at Suez wounded British national pride, leading one MP to describe it as [...] "Britain's Waterloo" [...] and another to suggest that the country had become an [...] "American satellite". Margaret Thatcher later described the mindset she believed had befallen Britain's political leaders as [...] "Suez syndrome" [...] where they âwent from believing that Britain could do anything to an almost neurotic belief that Britain could do nothingâ, from which Britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982.|$|E
500|$|Other presidents, {{as well as}} First Ladies, {{are also}} said to haunt the White House. Witnesses {{in the past two}} centuries have {{reported}} that Thomas Jefferson can be heard playing his violin in the Yellow Oval Room. President Andrew Jackson is said to be seen lying on what is thought to be his old bed [...] in the Queens' Bedroom (also known as the Rose Room), and his guttural laugh has been heard in the White House {{since the beginning of the}} 1860s. First Lady press secretary Liz Carpenter heard the laugh and swore it was Jackson's, and Mary Todd Lincoln claimed to have heard the stomping and swearing of an invisible presence which she claimed was the uncouth Jackson. White House seamstress Lillian Rogers Parks said she was sewing in the Queen's Bedroom and felt a presence, cold air, and then a hand on the back of her chair. She quickly left the room, and for the rest of her time in the White House she refused to enter the room again <b>without</b> <b>at</b> least one other person accompanying her. The spirit of William Henry Harrison, it is claimed, haunts the attic, and President John Tyler allegedly haunts the Blue Room. First Lady Frances Folsom Cleveland, who was married to President Grover Cleveland in the White House's Blue Room in 1886, is widely claimed to haunt the room where she was married and was seen there after her death in 1947.|$|E
