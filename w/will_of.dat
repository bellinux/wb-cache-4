5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free <b>will</b> <b>of</b> humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the <b>will</b> <b>of</b> human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E
