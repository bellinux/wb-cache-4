25|$|The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force {{ordered a}} utility {{variant of the}} UH-60L {{designated}} UH-60JA in 1995. The JGSDF began receiving the UH-60JA in 1997. It features improved avionics, including FLIR, Color weather radar, GPS receiver, a Night Vision Goggle compatible cockpit and <b>wire</b> <b>cutter.</b> The JGSDF plans to acquire 70.|$|E
25|$|The ARM {{light machine}} gun variant is {{additionally}} equipped with a carrying handle, folding bipod and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, {{can be used to}} open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose which damaged them.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic {{handguard}} and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle {{can be used with}} a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>cutters.</b> Factory No. 174 {{developed}} special <b>wire</b> <b>cutters</b> for T-26 {{tanks in}} 1940. The automatically operated TN-3 tank <b>wire</b> <b>cutters</b> were intended for breaching enemy wire obstacles. They were {{located on the}} rear of the vehicle over the tank tracks, cutting off wire caught in the tracks. Trials performed in October 1940 in Kubinka proving ground demonstrated that the design needed improvement.|$|R

2500|$|Experiments on the Holt {{caterpillar}} tracks started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75hp wheel-directed {{model and the}} 45hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing {{the superiority of the}} latter. [...] The Castéran and the Killen-Strait Tractor were also tested but rejected. Work was now begun on an auto-mitrailleuse blindée à chenilles ("tracked armoured self-propelled machine gun"). On 16 June, new experiments followed in front of the President of the Republic Raymond Poincaré, leading to the order of six, later expanded to ten, armoured tracked vehicles for further testing. The type was since July called a machine offensive à chenilles ("tracked offensive machine") and was based on the Baby Holt with a suspension that was to be thirty centimetres lengthened. [...] In August drawings were made of what was now designated the tracteur blindé et armé ("armoured and armed tractor"). In September 1915 the Schneider programme was combined with an official one for the development of an armoured barbed <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> by engineer and Member of Parliament Jules-Louis Breton, the Breton-Prétot machine. [...] Ten of the fifteen available Baby Holt vehicles were to be armoured and fitted with the <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> of which ten systems had been ordered on 7 August. [...] This involved the Service Automobile in the project. [...] On 10 September, new experiments were made for Commandant L. Ferrus, an officer who had been involved in the study (and ultimate rejection) of the Levavasseur tank project in 1908.|$|E

[...] they said as the apprentice came down the staircase. [...] "How about the shop?" [...] said someone. [...] "Oh! hang the shop!" [...] said Carshot and made gruntulous demands for a corkscrew with a thing to cut the wire. Pierce, the dog! had a <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> in his pocket knife. How Shalford would have stared at the gold tipped bottles if he had chanced to take an early train! Bang with the corks, and bang! Gluck, gluck, gluck, and sizzle! ...|$|E

50|$|The {{term has}} its roots in the testing of {{electronic}} devices, where an engineer would sit at a lab bench with tools for measurement and manipulation, such as oscilloscopes, multimeters, soldering irons, <b>wire</b> <b>cutters,</b> and so on, and manually verify the correctness of the device under test (DUT).|$|R

50|$|All {{soldiers}} were equipped with hand grenades. Special units such as flamethrower teams, <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> teams, and 81mm mortar teams could {{be assigned to}} companies as well as medics joining a battalion. These teams usually consisted of anywhere from two to five people with special training using their weapon. Soldiers could carry a total of 16 US issued guns during battle.|$|E

50|$|For wire-guided torpedoes, {{the muzzle}} door must remain open because the {{guidance}} wire is still {{connected to the}} inside of the breech door to receive commands from the submarine’s fire-control system. A <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> on the inside of the breech door is activated to release the wire and its protective cable. These are drawn clear of the ship prior to shutting the muzzle door.|$|E
50|$|The first {{land vehicle}} <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> to be {{demonstrated}} was fitted to the Killen-Strait tractor, during a demonstration in 1915. This used a pre-existing design of torpedo net cutter, {{intended for use}} on submarines. Despite the tactical importance of removing barbed wire barriers during World War I, this type of cutter was not attempted in the field. Heavy tanks were used simply to crush the obstacles.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> is a {{military}} installation used to protect personnel in open vehicles against taut-wire traps. It was first used late in World War II and mainly installed as a field modification. There are no standard models, but wire cutters usually consisted {{of a piece of}} iron installed vertically on the front bumper coming up between two and three feet above the windshield of the vehicle when raised.|$|E
50|$|Some Saxon IS, or Saxon Patrol, {{vehicles}} were acquired for service in Northern Ireland, serving as ambulances or troop carriers, which had extendible wings {{that could be}} used as protective shields during a riot. Compared to the standard model, these have various minor modifications intended for internal security operations, such as searchlights and <b>wire</b> <b>cutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The barrier {{has been}} criticized for being easy to get around. Some methods include digging under it (sometimes using complex tunnel systems), {{climbing}} the fence (using <b>wire</b> <b>cutters</b> to remove barbed-wire) or locating and digging holes in vulnerable sections of the wall. Many Latin-Americans have also traveled by boat through the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Coast.|$|R
50|$|Using a downrigger may be hazardous. Many manmade {{reservoirs}} mask submerged {{trees and}} other structure beneath the surface. A downrigger's weight may foul on such objects. When such a snag occurs {{in conjunction with}} high winds, it may cause a lighter boat to capsize. It is therefore prudent to carry <b>wire</b> <b>cutters</b> to avoid this potentially lethal scenario.|$|R
