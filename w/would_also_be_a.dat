5|$|In the report, Hamilton {{felt that}} the {{securities}} should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable {{and that the government}} should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stimulant to the economy.|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
50|$|Rosidor married Charlotte Meslier, the {{daughter}} of a couple of comedians trained by Mathias Meslier and Nicole Gassot with whom he had a son, Claude-Ferdinand Guillemay du Chesnay who <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> actor.|$|R

25|$|Andrew T. Forcehimes {{argues that}} {{the way we think}} about {{copyrights}} is inconsistent, because every argument for (physical) public libraries <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> argument for stealing ebooks and every argument against stealing ebooks <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> argument against libraries.|$|R
5|$|The {{marketing}} strategy for Dangerous Journeys: Mythus was multi-pronged: {{in addition to}} the RPG and setting to be published by Games Designers Workshop, and the Mythus computer game being prepared by NEC and JVC, there <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> series of books based on the Mythus setting written by Gygax. So in addition to his work on the RPG and the Mythus setting, Gygax wrote three novels, released under publisher Penguin/Roc and later reprinted by Paizo Publishing: The Anubis Murders, The Samarkand Solution, and Death in Delhi.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} {{from the edge of}} the city at Yonkers to 14th Street. It would be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on it would be a four-track line. The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of the}} sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
50|$|The {{convention}} {{would be}} revived {{by the end}} of World War II by the creation of the BeNeLux. It <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> inspiration for the BeNeLux memorandum of 1955, which was presented at the Messina Conference of 1955.|$|R
5000|$|The French daily Libération {{adds that}} the word [...] "welcome culture" [...] was {{originally}} created decades ago in the tourism industry.

50|$|In the 1955-56 season, Canito {{appeared}} in 27 games as Athletic won the top division title, and <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> essential defensive unit as they conquered three Copa del Rey trophies {{in just four}} years (for {{a total of four}} during his spell).|$|R
5|$|In 1962 he {{returned}} to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences. There, representatives of KANU and KADU met with British officials to establish {{the nature of a}} new constitution. It was agreed that Kenya would be divided into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but that there <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strong central government and both an upper and lower house. At the time, Kenyatta was willing to make concessions to KADU on issues like regional authority, aware that he would amend these aspects of the constitution when in office. On his return, he accepted a minor post in the coalition government, that of the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs and Economic Planning.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October, MSP and Shadow Local Government Minister Sarah Boyack {{became the}} first person to {{announce}} her candidacy for party leader. MSP and Shadow Health Minister Neil Findlay, and then MP and Shadow Secretary of State for International Development Jim Murphy, were the second and third candidates to declare their candidacies, on 29 October. On 1 November, Katy Clark, the MP for North Ayrshire and Arran, {{became the first}} person to join the deputy leadership race. Kezia Dugdale, an MSP for Lothian and Labour's Shadow Education Secretary at Holyrood, announced on 2 November that she <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> deputy leadership candidate. Each candidate was required to secure ten nominations from among the 80 Scottish Labour members of the House of Commons, Scottish Parliament, and European Parliament. Of those standing in the contest, Murphy received the support of 43 parliamentarians, and Findlay and Boyack secured 12 and 10 nominations, respectively. Dugdale was backed by 51 of her colleagues and Clark had 11 nominations.|$|E
5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Proculus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> diminutive of Proca, {{the name of one}} of the kings of Alba Longa. In that case, Proca <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ancient praenomen. Of course, it is entirely possible that Proca is derived from the same root as procus and procer.|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the typical}} {{vegetation}} of the zone, {{it is possible}} to cultivate two aromatic plants, úñicá and [...] panizará, used locally as infusions; these plants which could <b>be</b> commercialized on <b>a</b> great scale, would generate significant economic income for the population and, <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> alternative (and perhaps more pleasant) beverage to the tea and other products.|$|R

25|$|One {{possible}} conclusion from {{mixing the}} concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> scientific explanation/formulation generator.

2500|$|The {{state can}} <b>be</b> called <b>a</b> caliphate, but the [...] "caliph" [...] {{would not be}} the {{traditional}} descendant of the Quraysh tribe [...] but (Maududi believed) the entire Muslim community, a [...] "popular vicegerency". (Although there <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> individual leader chosen by the Muslim community.) Thus the state would <b>be</b> not <b>a</b> [...] "theocracy", but a [...] "theodemocracy".|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of self-disorders may have predictive power for whether {{those with an}} at risk mental state will develop psychosis; the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide by people with schizophrenia, though depression <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important factor; predicting initial social dysfunction in people with either schizophrenic or bipolar psychosis; and whether a person will move to a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis later.|$|R
25|$|The lack of sign changes {{also shows}} that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy , not {{proportional}} to each other, {{there would be a}} linear combination of the two that <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ground state resulting in a zero solution.|$|E
25|$|In ancient times, Iyers, {{along with}} Iyengars and other Tamil Brahmins, lived in {{exclusive}} Brahmin quarters of their village {{known as an}} agrahāram.

30|$|Instead of exerting {{political}} pressure {{with the goal}} of driving up the number of substances on the candidate list or in the authorisation procedure, clear signals would be necessary instead, reassuring the actors that the mentioned uses will remain possible in the future.
