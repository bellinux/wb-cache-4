Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2.

5|$|The {{population}} of Hong Kong Island was 7,450 when the Union Flag raised over Possession Point on 26 January 1841. It mostly consisted of Tanka fishermen and Hakka charcoal burners, whose settlements scattered along several coastal hamlets. In the 1850s, {{a large number}} of Chinese immigrants crossed the then-free border to escape from the Taiping Rebellion.

5|$|Although {{military}} {{reform was}} delayed {{until the end}} of his reign, Leopold did succeed in convincing parliament of the need to extend Belgium's defenses. Construction of fortresses along the border by both the French and Germans in the mid-1880s worried the Belgian government that their country might be used as an invasion route. In 1887, a program of fortification construction began along the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Designed by the leading military architect Henri Alexis Brialmont, nine forts were built at Namur to guard against an offensive from France, while twelve were built around Liège, near the German border. Completed in 1892, they supplemented the existing National Redoubt at Antwerp, which was later modernized and extended. The fortifications <b>would</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> major role in the opening stages of the First World War.|$|E

Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing <b>would</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1941 the Australian ICorps was {{concentrated}} in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East. Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the corps, including the 6thand 7thDivisions, returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia. The Australian Government agreed to requests from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9thDivision in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73squadrons. The Government did not intend that the 9thDivision <b>would</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> major role in active fighting, and it was not sent any further reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Newer {{styles of}} play have {{recently}} emerged, pushing {{the bounds of}} what the gandingan was traditionally used for. One type of play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense, complicated rhythmic patterns upon the gandingan. This type of play unlike the olden (kamamatuan) style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold the gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound. Because of the strenuous type of play, male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign of masculinity, on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) <b>would</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> particular piece several times in rotation with each other. This type of play {{is said to have}} evolved from the spread of virtousic style on the agung.|$|E
5|$|Paul Dashiell, the Johns Hopkins {{player who}} nearly single-handedly beat the Naval Academy, later {{served as the}} team's head coach, leading the program to a 25–5–4 record between 1904 and 1906. The 1886 season kept Navy's overall win–loss record at an even 6–6–1. It also brought the Academy's record against Johns Hopkins to a 4–2 lead, from which Hopkins never recovered. The season {{marked the first time}} a team for the Naval Academy <b>would</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> multiple-game season. The 1886 {{schedule}} was the longest for the Naval Academy until 1891, when that year's squad played seven matches. Navy finished the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2. The school outscored their opponents 292–231, and would go on to finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3.|$|E
5|$|The 1884 {{win over}} Johns Hopkins brought the Naval Academy's overall win-loss record to positive, {{as well as}} once again giving the Midshipmen a lead over Hopkins in their rivalry.

It also marked the final time a Navy team finished a season unbeaten and untied; the closest a squad would come was in 1926, when they went 901. Navy finished the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2. The school outscored their opponents 292–231, and finished the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3.|$|E
