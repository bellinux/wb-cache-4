5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> {{to provide care}} to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal {{to cooperate with the}} hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E

Tyrion observes that Daenerys' enemies are growing, {{including}} former slaves and former masters. Varys promises that his spies will find {{the leader of the}} Sons of the Harpy. The two discover that someone has set fire to all of the ships in Meereen's harbor, and Tyrion realizes that Daenerys's forces <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to sail to Westeros.|$|E
5|$|Giles' dream {{presents}} a choice: either {{to remain a}} father figure and Watcher to Buffy, or to begin his own life, represented {{by the presence of}} his girlfriend Olivia, who pushes an empty baby stroller. During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to do her job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E

5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> {{to help him}} because he will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will come forward and set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds {{of millions of years}} in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total and there were no annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to occlude the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million years in the future.|$|E
5|$|Leon obtains {{two tickets}} to a music festival in France {{and plans to}} take ZsaZsa, but he tells Fatboy he slept with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber), leaving Fatboy unsure {{of what to do}} as {{he does not want to}} hurt ZsaZsa. He tells Mercy, who then tells ZsaZsa, who dumps Leon and takes Fatboy's van to France. Leon decides to go to France anyway, leaving Fatboy sad at the loss of two of his best friends, however, Leon and Fatboy stay in contact. He joins the local church choir but fears he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to perform at their event as he felt {{pressured}} into joining by Dot and cannot sing very well. Mercy tells him he should just mime, but then Dot and the choir leader Edward Bishop (Frank Barrie) decide to give Fatboy a solo. Fatboy is unable to go through with it and walks out of the performance, so Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) takes over. At a New Year's Eve party, Fatboy kisses Mercy to put Kim off flirting with him.|$|E

5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} for forwards, however, where no daily true-up {{takes place in}} turn creates credit risk for forwards, {{but not so much}} for futures. Simply put, the risk of a forward contract is that the supplier <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to deliver the referenced asset, or that the buyer <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to pay for it on the delivery date or the date at which the opening party closes the contract.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the modern}} fantasy genre, the wyvern is usually {{considered}} to have two legs, whereas the dragon may have either four or none. Wyverns tend to be smaller, weaker, not as intelligent, and ultimately inferior to the much more ferocious and powerful dragon. While a dragon almost always {{has the ability to}} breathe fire (though other types of breath such as lightning have been seen as well), a wyvern <b>will</b> usually <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to breathe fire. Those that can breathe fire are sometimes termed [...] "fire drakes" [...] and are still considered a lesser form.

25|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} white dwarf depends upon its mass. A star of a few solar masses will ignite carbon fusion to form magnesium, neon, and smaller amounts of other elements, resulting in a white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that it can lose enough mass to get below the Chandrasekhar limit (see below), and provided that the ignition of carbon is not so violent as to blow the star apart in a supernova. A star of mass {{on the order of}} magnitude of the Sun <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to ignite carbon fusion, and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of carbon and oxygen, and of mass too low to collapse unless matter is added to it later (see below). A star of less than about half the mass of the Sun <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to ignite helium fusion (as noted earlier), and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of helium.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{particles}} {{predicted by}} GUT models {{are expected to}} have masses around the GUT scale—just a few orders of magnitude below the Planck scale—and so will be well beyond the reach of any foreseen particle collider experiments. Therefore, the particles predicted by GUT models <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to be observed directly and instead the effects of grand unification might be detected through indirect observations such as proton decay, electric dipole moments of elementary particles, or the properties of neutrinos. Some GUTs, such as the Pati-Salam model, predict the existence of magnetic monopoles.|$|E

Like John Calvin, Arminius affirmed total depravity, but Arminius believed that only prevenient grace allowed men to choose salvation:Concerning grace and free <b>will,</b> this <b>is</b> what I teach according to the Scriptures and orthodox consent: Free <b>will</b> <b>is</b> <b>unable</b> to begin or to perfect any true and spiritual good, without grace....
