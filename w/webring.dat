[...] "Bomis: The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Ring", devoted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, organized over 50 sites related to the program. Sheila Jeffreys noted in her Beauty and Misogyny that in 2004 Bomis maintained [...] "The Lipstick Fetish Ring", which helped users with a particular attraction to women in makeup.|$|E
5000|$|In early October 2007, <b>Webring</b> {{was granted}} a {{trademark}} on [...] "Webring" [...] from the USA Trademark office. Also in that month, Yahoo's long partnership ended as <b>Webring</b> ownership repurchased <b>Webring</b> stock held by Yahoo, marking {{the first time since}} the late 1990s that <b>Webring</b> was again privately held.|$|E
50|$|On September 26, 2006, <b>Webring</b> Inc. {{announced}} a new <b>WebRing</b> Premium Membership Program. They have separated memberships into two types, <b>WebRing</b> 1.0 and <b>WebRing</b> 2.0. Sites {{that are part of}} <b>WebRing</b> 1.0 will be limited to 50 webrings per URL. Existing 1.0 members can maintain more than 50, but can not add more. In conjunction with the premium membership program, <b>WebRing</b> introduced an affiliate program, in which webmasters earn money when others join webrings from their site; they earn an additional payment if the new member purchases a premium membership.|$|E
5000|$|A similar website was Alt-webring.com, {{using the}} Ringlink (Free CGI Perl program for running <b>webrings.).</b> The first [...] "Alt-webring" [...] first {{appeared}} in the Internet Archive on September 2006. Alt-webring.com has since closed.|$|R
5000|$|By making wiki links {{simpler to}} type {{for the members}} of a {{particular}} community, these features help bring the different wikis closer together. Furthering that goal, interwiki [...] "bus tours" [...] (similar to <b>webrings)</b> have been created to explain the purposes and highlights of different wikis. Such examples on Wikipedia include [...] and [...]|$|R
50|$|Around {{the same}} time that these {{programs}} were first being written, personal web pages were becoming popular (through services such as Angelfire and GeoCities), and programmers began creating websites to host their work, along with tutorials and other calculator-relevant information. This {{led to the formation of}} TI calculator <b>webrings</b> and eventually a few large communities, including the now-defunct TI-Files and still-active ticalc.org.|$|R
50|$|On April 15, 2001, Yahoo! {{pulled their}} support of <b>WebRing,</b> leaving it {{in the hands of}} one {{technician}} from the original <b>WebRing,</b> Timothy Killeen. He unveiled a <b>WebRing</b> free of Yahoo! influence on October 12, 2001. In the years since this change, many of the features which had been stripped by Yahoo!, particularly customization options, were reimplemented into the <b>WebRing</b> system.|$|E
50|$|In May 1994 Sage {{developed}} a script based on work by Denis Howe and Giraldo Hierro {{that became the}} technology behind <b>WebRing.</b> Sage launched <b>WebRing</b> in June 1995 and eventually sold it to Starseed, Inc. in 1997.|$|E
50|$|To {{be a part}} of the <b>webring,</b> {{each site}} has a common {{navigation}} bar; it contains links to the previous and next site. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at; this is the origin of the term <b>webring.</b> However, the select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline.A <b>webring</b> is managed from one website which is able to omit the websites that have dropped out or are no longer reachable. The advantage of a <b>webring</b> is that if the user is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another website on the same topic. Webrings usually have a moderator who decides which pages to include in the <b>webring.</b> After approval, webmasters add their pages to the ring by 'linking in' to the ring; this requires adding the necessary HTML or JavaScript to their site.|$|E
5000|$|As diarists (sometimes called escribitionists) {{began to}} learn from each other, several <b>Webrings</b> formed to connect various diaries and journals; the most popular was Open Pages, which started in July 1996 and had 537 members as of 20 October 1998. A {{community}} website called Diarist.net was formed and awarded [...] "The Diarist Awards" [...] quarterly from 1999 through 2004. There {{were a number of}} lists of diaries and journals by topic, called [...] "'burbs", which allowed people to find sites that had some correlation to each other.|$|R
2500|$|Inspired by the remarkably {{successful}} {{initial public}} offering of Netscape in 1995, and having accumulated capital through [...] "speculating on interest-rate and foreign-currency fluctuations", Wales {{decided to leave the}} realm of financial trading and became an Internet entrepreneur. In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis, a web portal featuring user-generated <b>webrings</b> and, for a time, erotic photographs. Wales described it as a [...] "guy-oriented search engine" [...] with a market similar to that of Maxim magazine; the Bomis venture did not ultimately turn out to be successful.|$|R
50|$|Casio {{made the}} pocket viewer SDK available. Using the SDK users could {{create their own}} {{applications}} called add-ins, which could be downloaded to the pocket viewer using the synchronization software. In time, a small user base who created and made their add-in applications available on-line for free or for profit emerged. User forums such as pocketviewer.de, pocketviewer.com, pocket-viewer.ru and pocketviewer <b>webrings</b> flourished in their time and have since closed. During 2005-2010, the second hand market was on the vane. OWBasic, a third party add-in, provided the easy to learn and use BASIC interpreted programming language on the hand-helds, expanding their functionality to also being programmable hand-held calculators/computers. The device had the computer power and functionality as the home computers of the 80s.|$|R
50|$|Denis Howe started EUROPa (Expanding Unidirectional Ring Of Pages) at Imperial College in 1994. The idea {{developed}} further when Giraldo Hierro conceptualized {{a central}} CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script to enhance functionality. Sage Weil developed such a script in May 1994. Weil's script gained popularity, pushing Weil in June 1995 {{to form a}} company called <b>WebRing.</b> In 1997, Weil sold <b>WebRing</b> to Starseed, Inc.|$|E
50|$|LinkExchange was {{a popular}} {{internet}} advertising cooperative, similar in function to a <b>webring,</b> originally known as Internet Link Exchange or ILE.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 Starseed was {{acquired}} by GeoCities, who made no major changes to the system. Just a few months later, in early 1999, Yahoo! bought GeoCities, and eighteen months after the acquisition, on September 5, 2000, Yahoo! unveiled a fully overhauled <b>WebRing,</b> known as Yahoo! <b>WebRing.</b> Although Yahoo!'s implementation was meant to streamline the way the rings were managed and provide a more consistent interface for all rings, many of these changes were unpopular with ringmasters accustomed to the older system which gave them more flexibility.|$|E
40|$|Presently, {{there is}} an {{abundance}} of sites, across media, promoting acts of communal reading (televised book clubs, <b>webrings,</b> publishers’ book discussion questions, etc.). This article forms a case-study of what usages of reading and concurrently what reading subjects are framed in the Swedish televised book club, Malous bokklubb, modeled on Oprah’s Book Club in the U. S. and Richard & Judy’s Book Club in the U. K. The main reading protocol underwritten by various textual fields in the show is the one of rich emotional continuity between the reading subject and its textual others. The show partakes in a middlebrow “women’s culture” whose main message is that women, across differences, have something in common, and that the stories of almost any other’s {{can be used to}} work on the self...|$|R
5000|$|Andrew {{currently}} {{resides in}} Oakland and has recently commented about the design. [...] "I designed this flag {{at the time}} because back then, {{there was nothing for}} us besides the standard rainbow flag, the bear pride flag, the leather pride flag. Before Google existed in the capacity that it does today, I deep-searched the internet to see if I could find a trans pride flag and found none, so as an artist/designer, designed one myself for our community. The flag itself was meant to represent the trans community as a whole, with the twinned symbol representing our journey and the qualities that we possess. I published the design on my site as [...] "the first trans pride flag", and some trans sites picked it up. We were all a tight-knit community of sites back then, linking to each other through pride <b>webrings.</b> Though it was my desire, I never had the funds to get it produced." ...|$|R

5000|$|In late 1996, the Dragon's Realm {{joined the}} Forgotten Realms <b>Webring.</b> Paladin started {{one of the}} first Dragonlance Webrings to {{highlight}} his favorite campaign world. Unfortunately, the Dragon's Realm didn't really fit the Dragonlance mold, so a new site called [...] "The Lost Citadel" [...] was created. Both sites existed in the same 1 MB directory on Geocities. (To put that in perspective, the current version of the Nexus is over 90 times larger.) The Lost Citadel was invited to join an exclusive Dragonlance <b>Webring</b> called the 'Top 5% of Kender Sites,' run by the Sean MacDonald (aka Kipper Snifferdoo), keeper of the Kencyclopedia website.|$|E
50|$|A <b>webring</b> (or web ring) is a {{collection}} of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.|$|E
50|$|While {{the largest}} <b>webring</b> {{services}} {{use their own}} proprietary software, a few programs have been written that {{make it possible for}} webmasters to run webrings without being dependent on an off-site service.

5000|$|Weblogs {{have existed}} {{for close to}} two decades. However, it wasn't until {{the second half of}} the 1990s that weblogs began to grow in popularity. In 1998, there were just a handful of sites of the type that are now {{identified}} as weblogs (so named by Jorn Barger in December 1997). In 1999, there were 23 known weblogs, and Pitas http://www.pitas.com/, the first free build your own weblog tool, was launched. Also in 1999 weblogs changed from a mix of links, commentary, and thoughts, to short form journal entries. An early recorded use of the term [...] "edublog" [...] can be traced to a <b>webring</b> called the Edublog <b>WebRing,</b> founded on January 30, 2002. The new use of weblogs are largely interest driven and attract readers who have similar interests. In 2004, there were an estimated 3 million blogs and as of July 2011, there are an estimated 164 million blogs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ascendancy}} of Evangelicalism in the US, particularly in its more socially conservative forms, challenged {{many people in}} mainline churches. Recently, a focus for {{those who wish to}} challenge this ascendancy has been provided by Jim Wallis of Sojourners, who described himself as a progressive evangelical Christian, although Sojourners has rejected advertisements urging mainline churches to welcome gay members. [...] This has enabled many Christians who are uncomfortable with conservative evangelicalism to identify themselves explicitly as [...] "Progressive Christians." [...] At the onset of this new movement to organize Progressive Christians, the single largest force holding together was a <b>webring,</b> The Progressive Christian Bloggers Network, and supporters frequently find and contact each other through dozens of online chat-rooms.|$|E

5000|$|The Birthday Massacre have {{utilized}} the Internet throughout their career and are {{an example of}} a musical group that has evolved alongside file sharing, and advancements in audio streaming capabilities. Initially the band distributed their music for free, using music sharing software Napster, in addition to sharing their music on MP3.com and their official websites. The band was active in updating their websites regularly, interacting with fans on their forum, and offering their site in multiple languages like French, German and Japanese. Early on the band encouraged fans to create their own content, and consequently the band saw a surge in fan-created content, which they organized on a <b>webring</b> called Violetprison.com, posting in 2003; [...] "We want our fans to contribute and be involved so rather than telling newcomers who we are, we would rather our fans tell you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The modern blog {{evolved from}} the online diary, where people would keep a running account of their {{personal}} lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers. A few called themselves [...] "escribitionists". The Open Pages <b>webring</b> included members of the online-journal community. Justin Hall, who began eleven years of personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally {{recognized as one of}} the earliest bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle. Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, video, and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters.|$|E

5000|$|As {{response}} to the missing availability of abandonware, people have distributed old software since shortly after the beginning of personal computing, but the activity remained low-key until {{the advent of the}} Internet. While trading old games has taken many names and forms, the term [...] "abandonware" [...] was coined by Peter Ringering in late 1996. Ringering found classic game websites similar to his own, contacted their webmasters, and formed the original Abandonware Ring in February 1997. This original <b>webring</b> {{was little more than a}} collection of sites linking to adventureclassicgaming.com. Another was a site indexing them all to provide a rudimentary search facility. In October 1997, the Interactive Digital Software Association sent cease and desist letters to all sites within the Abandonware Ring, which led to most shutting down. An unintended consequence (called the Streisand effect in Internet parlance) was that it spurred others to create new abandonware sites and organizations that came to outnumber the original Ring members. Sites formed after the demise of the original Abandonware Ring include Abandonia, Bunny Abandonware and Home of the Underdogs. In later years abandonware websites actively acquired and received permissions from developers and copyright holders (e.g. Jeff Minter, Magnetic Fields or Gremlin Interactive) for legal redistribution of abandoned works, an example is World of Spectrum who acquired the permission from many developers and successfully retracted a DMCA case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{creation}} of knowl-edge bases by enumerating and organizing all web occurrences of certain subgraphs. We focus onsubgraphs that are signatures of web phenomena such as tightly-focused topic communities, we-brings, taxonomy trees, keiretsus, etc. For instance, the signature of a <b>webring</b> is a centralpage with bidirectional links to a number of other pages. We develop novel algorithms for such enu-meration problems. A key technical contribution is the development of a model for the evolutionof the web graph, based on experimental observations derived from a snapshot of the web. Weargue that our algorithms run efficiently in this model, and use the model to explain some sta-tistical phenomena on the web that emerged during our experiments. Finally, we describe the de-sign and implementation of Campfire, a knowledge base of over one hundred thousand web com-munities. 1 Overview The {{subject of this}} paper is the creation of knowledgebases by enumerating and organizing all web occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Ceph is a {{distributed}} {{storage system}} designed to providing high performance and reliability at scales of up to thousands of storage nodes. The system {{is based on a}} distributed object storage layer call RADOS that provides durability, availability, efficient data distribution, and rich object semantics. This storage can be consumed directly via an object-based interface, or via file, block, or REST-based object services that are built on top of it. Clusters are composed of commodity components to provide a reliable storage service serving multiple use-cases. This seminar will cover the basic architecture of Ceph, with a focus on how each service can be consumed in a research and infrastructure environment. 	About the speaker 	Sage Weil, Founder and current CTO of Inktank Inc, is the creator of the Ceph project.
