25|$|In retrospect, {{although}} Ahlquist <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> his ″one transmitter – two receptors″ postulate, he erred in {{the identification}} of the transmitter with adrenaline. There is an additional qualification. For many responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, the ATP co-stored with noradrenaline (see above) is a cotransmitter. It acts through purinoceptors. Lastly, Ahlquist failed to adduce the selectivity of all antagonists known at his time for the α-adrenoceptor as an additional argument.|$|E

25|$|As was {{the case}} in most of central Berlin, almost all of the {{buildings}} around Potsdamer Platz were turned to rubble by air raids and heavy artillery bombardment during the last years of World War II. The three most destructive raids (out of 363 that the city suffered), occurred on 23 November 1943, and 3 February and 26 February 1945. Things were not helped by the very close proximity of Hitler's Reich Chancellery, just one block away in Voßstraße, and many other Nazi government edifices nearby as well, and so Potsdamer Platz <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> a major target area.|$|E

The remnants of the division were withdrawn two nights later.|$|E

For the most part, Hicks <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> his assumption that Forrest would not assault the fort, but Confederate colonel Albert P. Thompson, {{a native of}} the area, did briefly attempt to capture it before being killed with 24 men from his unit. Forrest held the city for ten hours, destroying the Union headquarters, as well as the buildings housing the quartermaster and commissary. Forrest also captured a total of 200 horses and mules before withdrawing to Mayfield. Following the raid, Forrest granted furlough to the Kentuckians under his command so they could secure better clothing and mounts. As agreed, every man reported back to Trenton, Tennessee on April 4.|$|E

25|$|Before Richelieu's {{ascent to}} power, most of Europe had become enmeshed in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). France was not openly {{at war with}} the Habsburgs, who ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, so {{subsidies}} and aid were provided secretly to their adversaries. He considered the Dutch Republic as one of France's most important allies, for it bordered directly with the Spanish Netherlands and <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the Eighty Years War with Spain at that time. Luckily for him, Richelieu was a bon français, just like the king, who had already decided to subsidize the Dutch to fight against the Spanish via the Treaty of Compiègne in June 1624, prior to Richelieu's appointment to Prime minister in August. That same year, a military expedition, secretly financed by France and commanded by Marquis de Coeuvres, started an action with the intention of liberating the Valtelline from Spanish occupation. In 1625 Richelieu also sent money to Ernst von Mansfeld, a famous mercenary general operating in Germany in English service. However, in May 1626, when war costs had almost ruined France, king and cardinal made peace with Spain via the Treaty of Monçon. This peace quickly broke down after tensions due to the War of Mantuan Succession.|$|E

In short, nature should be seen as having a subjective and purposive aspect that deserves attention.|$|E

500|$|In particular, post-maneuver reports {{emphasized}} {{the vulnerability of}} tanks to antitank fire. This bolstered the pro-antitank philosophy strongly held by McNair. Devers differed, countering {{that the number of}} tank [...] "kills" [...] credited to antitank gunners was unrealistic and biased, feeling that [...] "we were licked by a set of umpires' rules". McNair continued to push for an independent tank destroyer force, [...] while Devers argued that [...] "the weapon to best the tank is a better tank". Nevertheless, in November Marshall authorized creation of a tank destroyer force. The Tank Destroyer Center was created, and the War Department ordered the activation of 53 tank destroyer battalions. Battlefield experience would prove that Devers <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> combat most tanks were knocked out by other tanks while tank destroyers were mainly used as mobile artillery support. The tank destroyer program was scaled back, and tank destroyer battalions were deactivated. At the end of the war, the tank destroyer quasi-arm was disbanded.|$|E
500|$|When Linnaeus reached Harderwijk, {{he began}} working towards a degree immediately; at the time, Harderwijk was known for {{awarding}} [...] "instant" [...] degrees after {{as little as a}} week. First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden, which he then defended in a public debate. His dissertation, submitted on 23 June, was titled Dissertatio medica inauguralis in qua exhibetur hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa ("Inaugural thesis in medicine, in which a new hypothesis on the cause of intermittent fevers is presented"). He concluded that malaria arose only in places with clay-rich soil. He is now known to have been wrong about the cause, not having a microscope good enough to see malarial parasites, which were spread by mosquitoes breeding in the water that collected in ruts and puddles. But he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> predicting that traditional Chinese medicine, including the use of wormwood (Artemisia), is a potential source of antimalarial drugs; Artemisinins, derived from wormwood, are now the principal antimalarial drugs.|$|E

Not only was the company forced from its facilities, roughly 300 members of its 700+ staff were left homeless. Immediately after the storm, Gibbons began a program to help get the company back on track. The company's recovery was helped due to pre-planning before the storm's landfall; Corporate backoffice data was moved to Seattle, Washington before the storm struck in order to safeguard critical records, and the company established a temporary [...] "command center" [...] at the Doral Resort and Country Club in Miami within eight days of the hurricanes passing. Additional operations were temporarily decentralized by temporarily shifting some corporate functions to regional offices. The facility would eventually take more than a year to rebuild, finally opening in September 1993.|$|E

500|$|The 1920-1930s {{have been}} called the Golden Age of Sports, and Tunis <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the middle of {{much of it as}} a commentator, writer, and athlete, but he often criticized what he saw.

Tunis also believed that high salaries would destroy the pleasure and benefits sports brought the everyday player. His essay [...] "The Great God Football" [...] appeared in Harper's Magazine in 1928, attacking what he saw as the increasing commercialization of college football. The article became the center of a continuing controversy.

IBF Secretary General P K Muralidharan Raja said, [...] "The jury reviewed the bout and came to the conclusion that Vijender was holding his opponent and the referee <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> warning him.

It's a joke that somebody has won by scoring points just out of warnings."

500|$|He assumed {{office on}} November 7, 1912, but, as he later confessed, {{official}} records were modified {{to make it}} seem that he had been a civil servant since October 29. His time in office is described by critic Barbu Cioculescu as a bland affair, Mateiu having [...] "ehausted his [...] fantasy" [...] with his efforts to charm Bădărău. As Caragiale later recounted, he led talks with a delegation from the Kingdom of Serbia involving the initiative to build a bridge over the Danube to link the two states. In 1913, he became a Knight of the Romanian Order of the Crown (Coroana României), received the Russian Empire's Order of St. Anna 2nd Class. He was also awarded the Bene Merenti and Bărbăție și credință Romanian medals 1st Class. In 1913, Caragiale wrote the story Remember, while continuing his contributions to Viața Românească. Although his office was owed to Conservative-Democratic politics, Caragiale was still close to Bogdan-Pitești, whose daily newspaper Seara repeatedly published articles claiming to expose Take Ionescu's faction and often focused such attacks on Bădărău. His employment eventually ended on January 17, 1914, as the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. Brătianu came to power. According to Ion Vianu, Caragiale <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> assuming that his marginal involvement in the political intrigues had made him a target for Bădărău's adversity.|$|E
