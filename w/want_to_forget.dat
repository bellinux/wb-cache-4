500|$|Jon Caramanica for The New York Times {{commented that}} the remix of [...] "Birthday Cake", {{as well as the}} original, was [...] "very much so" [...] a good song. However, Caramanica was {{critical}} of the collaboration itself, due to Rihanna and Brown's history, writing [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget?</b> Fine. But don’t forgive." [...] Caramanica continued to explain his distaste, writing [...] "It displays an advanced understanding of marketing and an understanding of moral obligations and ethics that's not much more than rudimentary. It is a woman publicly accepting her abuser - nothing more, nothing less." [...] J. Bryan Lowder for The Huffington Post labelled the song as [...] "innuendo-iced" [...] with regard to the song's explicit lyrics. Lowder provided an explanation for what he thought the reason was behind Rihanna asking Brown to collaborate on [...] "Birthday Cake", writing: ...|$|E

[...] Bale employed a martial arts discipline called the Keysi Fighting Method, now modified for Bruce's current state and Bane's style. Bale has stated that The Dark Knight Rises will be his final Batman film. Bale acknowledged that Batman is [...] "not a healthy individual, this is somebody that is doing good, but he's right {{on the verge of}} doing bad". Bale clarifies that [...] "He doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> [...] He wants to maintain that anger he felt at that injustice". Bale felt bittersweet about leaving the franchise, saying that it was like [...] "saying goodbye to an old friend." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{secondary}} sites {{he would}} remove and later burn the victim's clothing, or {{in at least}} one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a Goodwill Industries collection bin. Bundy explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him. (A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to Kimberly Leach.) He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia, and to groom or dress up the cadavers. Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen. He took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. [...] "When you work hard to do something right," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> it." [...] Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an [...] "essential component", he told Keppel, and later Michaud; he needed to be [...] "extremely drunk" [...] while on the prowl in order to [...] "significantly diminish" [...] his inhibitions and to [...] "sedate" [...] the [...] "dominant personality" [...] that he feared might prevent his inner [...] "entity" [...] from acting on his impulses.|$|E

500|$|... "Wake Up", {{the opening}} track, is a mid-tempo number backed by dance, pop and {{electronic}} beats, and has [...] "a more mature pop-techno sound" [...] than Duff's previous work. Its instrumentation includes a guitar, bass and drums. Kelefa Anneth of The New York Times {{noted that the}} song contains musical influences of The Go-Go's. The lyrics of the song speak about having fun. Duff initially sings {{about the consequences of}} her fame and how people think they know [...] "everything about [...] " [...] ("There's people talking / They talk about me / They know my name / They think they know everything / But they don't know anything about me"). As the chorus draws near, the song takes on a [...] "party anthem" [...] approach, where Duff discusses the [...] "struggle" [...] for joy and self-confidence: [...] "I know I make mistakes / I'm living life day to day / It's never really easy but it's OK..." [...] According to Duff, the song [...] "makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> about all the pressure of dealing with your boss, or your teacher, or your mom, or ," [...] and lyrically discusses [...] "getting out and not forgetting to have some fun." [...] Duff has also said the song also [...] "talks about being in all [...] favorite places in the world, which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York." [...] "Beat of My Heart", the third track on the album, is inspired by the new wave genre. The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres. It carries a [...] "soft electronic pop" [...] sound and has the heart beat sound as its base. According to Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine, the word 'beat of my heart' is repeated forty-four times in the song.|$|E

I was deeply impressed. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> this concert, so I immediately returned to Aachen.|$|E
2500|$|While {{his mother}} was in the hospital, Ellison brought in a mobile {{recording}} rig and set microphones around her room to gather audio samples, such as a respirator and vital-sign monitors. The samples were also used in the closing track [...] "Galaxy in Janaki", a tribute to his mother. On the process of recording his mother's respirator, Ellison said: [...] "I {{know it was a}} weird thing to do. I'm not the type to go out recording things like that. But I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that space." [...] When asked where the title came from, he said: [...] "that's the term my aunt gave my mother. It means mother as well." [...] He also used other samples, such as video game sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Synthesizers also figured {{prominently}} on the 1984 follow-up, Das Buch, which courted {{trouble with}} the censors on the song [...] "Ich will nicht vergessen" [...] (I Don't <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Forget),</b> and its references to [...] "Deutschland," [...] a taboo in the GDR, which the band explained as a reference to Heinrich Heine, although the more immediate referent was divided Germany (Denk' ich an die Leute, drüben und hier, I think of the people over there and here). The title track, essentially a monologue set to music about a book on another planet describing a post-nuclear-war Earth, featured a Free German Youth choir. The band, who except for Scharfschwerdt were now in their 40s, declared they would play until their [...] "Rockerrente" [...] (Rocker's Pension) in the prophetic song of that name.|$|E
2500|$|The Nukak {{have already}} {{suffered}} {{the devastation of}} their population by malaria, measles and pulmonary diseases since their contact with the New Tribes Mission and other outsiders beginning in 1981; now, coca growers, left-wing FARC guerillas, right-wing AUC paramilitaries and the Colombian army have occupied their lands. These aboriginals have therefore become embroiled in Colombia's armed conflict. In 2006, a group of nearly 80 Nukak left the jungle and sought assimilation along with cultural preservation. As one of the migrants, Pia-pe, put it: [...] "We do {{want to join the}} white family, but we do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> words of the Nukak." [...] In October 2006, leader and Nukak Spanish speaker Maw-be' committed suicide by drinking poison; friends and the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) described him as in desperation in his inability to secure supplies or a safe return to their homeland for the Nukak.|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2009, Jindal {{delivered}} the official Republican response to President Obama's address {{to a joint}} session of Congress. Jindal called the president's economic stimulus plan [...] "irresponsible" [...] and argued against government intervention. He used Hurricane Katrina to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. [...] "Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us," [...] Jindal said. [...] "Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts." [...] He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina. The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as [...] "devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: [...] " [...] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government {{should not be allowed to}} fail again, but that government...never works. That government can't work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government." [...] David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal's mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating [...] "The one thing Republicans <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> is Katrina." [...] While Jindal's speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style.|$|E

2500|$|Vince Aletti from Rolling Stone {{also gave}} an {{unfavorable}} review, stating [...] "the formula is more rigorously locked in than before, {{and the range}} so tightly circumscribed that Houston's potential seems to have shrunk rather than expanded" [...] and the record is [...] "smug, repressive and ridiculously safe." [...] Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", calling it [...] "How Will I Know II", spoken at Hollywood's blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for Los Angeles Times, regarded the album as [...] "another commercial blockbuster", writing that the record is [...] "a series of highly accessible selections that will work {{on a variety of}} radio formats." [...] However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that Whitney did precious little to define the singer's vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn't assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of The Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: [...] "Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice takes us to places we know and to places we might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> and to places we dream about." [...] But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting [...] "There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring." [...] St. Petersburg Times showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating [...] " [...] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it's easy to be cynical about. But as products go, this is a pretty good one." [...] They also praised her vocals as follows: [...] "Houston's voice sounds good, real good. [...] She's firmer, more confident." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
