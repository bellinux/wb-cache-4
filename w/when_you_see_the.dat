Bonham soon put together another solo project that culminated in In the Name of My Father - The Zepset, which featured the songs of Led Zeppelin. Proceeds from the album went to charity.

Obviously we filmed {{it before}} this [...] {{happened}} and it's amazing irony, {{how much it}} makes sense. We're all separated and wandering the streets looking like it's the day after a funeral, with Ben {{in a suit and}} bare feet, and I'm never touching the ground. I'm sitting on a phone booth or lying on a car, to hint that I'm dead, that I'm singing from the dead. It's all about separation. It's almost like the director {{knew what was going to}} happen, but he can't have known. It's just one of those fate things." ...|$|E

500|$|The split-reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 {{feet long}} with A Husband's Jealous Wife included, {{was released on}} September 23, 1910. Advertising for the film was a bit mixed {{as to whether or}} not it was a comedy or a drama, stating, [...] "You have no idea as to how marvelously a Thanhouser can twist a story until you see this gripping dra - well, perhaps, it isn't a drama at that - or a comedy even. We hate to tip you off as to WHAT it is. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> picture, with its totally unlooked-for climax, you'll know why!" [...] Bowers would later term this as more of the slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser said the company would not produce. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theatres include Indiana, and Kansas. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One theater advertisement may have confused this film with another because it lists this film as a western film.|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re {{supposed to be}} together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t {{want to be a}} homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Sevigny took on {{the lead}} female role in the art house film The Brown Bunny (2003), which details a lonely {{traveling}} motorcycle racer reminiscing about his former lover. The film achieved notoriety for its final scene, which involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on star and director Vincent Gallo. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and opened to significant controversy and criticism from audiences and critics. She went on to defend the movie, [...] "It's a shame people write so many things when they haven't seen it. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> film, it makes more sense. It's an art film. It should be playing in museums. It's like an Andy Warhol movie." [...] After the film's release at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the William Morris Agency terminated Sevigny as a client. The agency believed the scene was [...] "one step above pornography", and claimed that Sevigny's career [...] "may never recover". In an interview with The Telegraph in 2003, when asked if she regretted the film, she responded: [...] "No, I was always committed to the project {{on the strength of}} Vincent alone. I have faith in his aesthetic... I try to forgive and forget, otherwise I'd just become a bitter old lady." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnston {{was entered}} as a {{competitor}} {{in the second}} series of Britain's Got Talent by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing [...] "Pie Jesu" [...] from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem. Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that [...] "it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang [...] "Tears in Heaven" [...] by Eric Clapton; judge Holden {{told him he had}} [...] "a gift from God in [...] voice". At the final on 30 May, he again sang [...] "Pie Jesu". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he [...] "was upset. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist Max Clifford said that it was [...] "quite possible" [...] that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.|$|E
500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You {{look in the mirror}} on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E
2500|$|Considering {{the title}} of the album, Steve Von Till conceded that the band members cannot agree on its precise meaning, but [...] "one thing that really resonates with me is that decay is the natural state of all things over time...When shit's falling apart, that is <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> people who have honor and will stand by what they said, or those that are self-serving or dishonorable and stab people in the back".|$|E

[...] "I mean she is obviously still good, she wheeled passed them {{at the top of}} the straight and she still let down. But I honestly I think when she gets in a high pressure race, when there is a lot of pace from the start like there was in last year's Cox Plate, that's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> best of her." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{roles in}} the films Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968), Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969), and Scars of Dracula (1970) all gave the Count very little to do. Lee said in an {{interview}} in 2005, [...] "all they do is write a story and try and fit the character in somewhere, which is very clear <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> films. They gave me nothing to do! I pleaded with Hammer to let me use some of the lines that Bram Stoker had written. Occasionally, I sneaked one in." [...] Although Lee may not have liked what Hammer was doing with the character, worldwide audiences embraced the films, which were all commercially successful.|$|E
2500|$|Republican Senator John McCain, co-crafter of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the party's 2008 presidential nominee, said [...] "there's {{going to}} be, over time, a {{backlash}} ... <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> amounts of union and corporate money that's {{going to go}} into political campaigns". McCain was [...] "disappointed by the decision of the Supreme Court and the lifting of the limits on corporate and union contributions" [...] but not surprised by the decision, saying that [...] "It was clear that Justice Roberts, Alito and Scalia, by their very skeptical and even sarcastic comments, were very much opposed to BCRA."

2500|$|I {{know there}} are a lot of fans who are going to watch to see how we explain Peyton and Lucas's absence.

I sort of buy that they're out living their lives. I've been very upfront with the studio and network in saying, Look, the audience may not accept a new version of the show.

2500|$|Peppino's brother Giovanni {{declared}} {{before the}} Italian Antimafia Commission: [...] "It seemed that Badalamenti was well liked by the carabinieri {{as he was}} calm, reliable, and always liked a chat. It almost {{felt like he was}} doing them a favour in that nothing ever happened in Cinisi, it was a quiet little town. If anything, we were subversives who made nuisances of ourselves. This was what the carabinieri thought. When I had a chance to speak to one of them – something which didn't happen often because I didn't really trust them – I realised that it was a widely held belief that Tano Badalamenti was a gentleman and it was us who were the trouble-makers." [...] "I often used to see them walking arm in arm with Tano Badalamenti and his henchmen.
