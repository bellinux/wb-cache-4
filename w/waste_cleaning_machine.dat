5000|$|A sand <b>cleaning</b> <b>machine,</b> beach cleaner, or (colloquially) sandboni is {{a vehicle}} that drags a raking or sifting device over beach sand to remove rubbish and other foreign matter. They are {{manually}} self-pulled vehicles on tracks or wheels or pulled by quad-bike or tractor. Seaside cities use beach <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> to combat the problems of litter left by beach patrons and other pollution washed up on their shores. A chief task in beach cleaning strategies is finding {{the best way to}} handle waste matter on the beaches, taking into consideration beach erosion and changing terrain. Beach <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> work by collecting sand by way of a scoop or drag mechanism and then raking or sifting anything large enough to be considered foreign matter, including sticks, stones, litter and other items. Similar applications include lake beaches, sandfields for beach volleyball and kindergarten and playing field sandpits. The word [...] "sandboni" [...] is a back-formation referencing the ice-surfacing machine Zamboni.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is not the}} use {{of water}} that makes wet {{cleaning}} a safest method for cleaning clothes. Computer-controlled wet <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines,</b> special dryers, safe detergents and non-toxic spot removers are what make wet cleaning an environmentally sound method. Wet <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> have controls {{that allow them to}} safely and efficiently clean a wide variety of garments in water. Detergents and spot removers are made of ingredients that are safer for workers and the environment, yet are as safe and effective at removing soils, stains and odors as dry cleaning solvents. Equipment, detergents and skill all contribute to successful wet cleaning.|$|R

It was indicated that the cleaning power and time were the two main factors for damaging the insulating layer of the cleaning objects. The measuring technology was presented by aluminum foil, and it analyzed feasibility and an area assessment method for the measurement method by aluminum foil. The practical long time test of the motor demonstrated that the measurement method by aluminum foil can provide safety design data support and experimental verification to the performance parameters design of the ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Many {{investments}} {{are made for}} maintaining hygiene in railways these days and various equipment are used by Indian railways for this purpose. Platform rider scrubber or platform <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> from different companies are purchased by Indian railways in recent times. As the technology grows there are more inventions {{in the field of}} machinery. Many of them are serving cleaning and hygiene maintenance. This project report is based on the “Manually Driven Platform <b>Cleaning</b> <b>Machine</b> ” which serves the basic needs of cleaning large floor areas especially Railway Platforms. Cleaning problems at various railway platforms and bus stations. As there is no adequate electricity in Jabalpur region, the use of automatic <b>cleaning</b> <b>machine</b> is not favourable. The main parts combining to form the overall structure are discussed below: II. THE MAIN FRAME The main frame used is designed especially to serve it purpose of overall floor cleaning. The whole structure is made up of heavy gauge square iron pipe having dimensions (1. 5 ” * 1. 5 ”) so that it may handle and bear the load of the rider and all the equipment that are to be fit on it to complete the whole structure...|$|R
