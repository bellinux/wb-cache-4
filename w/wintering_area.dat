40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} {{encountered by}} migratory seabirds in their <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> can shape their fitness. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain largely unknown as birds are relatively inaccessible during winter. To assess physiological condition during this period, we measured corticosterone concentrations in winter-grown primary feathers of female great skuas (Stercorarius skua) from three breeding colonies (Bjørnøya, Iceland, Shetland) with <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> identified from characteristic stable isotope signatures. We subsequently compared winter feather corticosterone levels between three <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> (Africa, Europe and America). Among females breeding in 2009, we found {{significant differences in}} feather corticosterone levels between <b>wintering</b> <b>areas.</b> Surprisingly, levels were significantly higher in Africa despite seemingly better local ecological factors (based on lower foraging effort). Moreover, contrary to our predictions, females sharing the same wintering grounds showed significant differences in feather corticosterone levels depending on their colony of origin suggesting that some skuas could be using suboptimal <b>wintering</b> <b>areas.</b> Among females <b>wintering</b> in Africa, Shetland females showed feather corticosterone levels on average 22 % lower than Bjørnøya and Iceland females. Finally, the lack of significant relationships between winter feather corticosterone levels and any of the breeding phenology traits {{does not support the}} hypothesis of potential carry-over effects of winter feather corticosterone.

500|$|The European {{nightjar}} is crepuscular and nocturnal. During the day {{it rests}} on the ground, often in a partly shaded location, or perches motionless lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch. The cryptic plumage {{makes it difficult to}} see in the daytime, and birds on the ground, if they are not already in shade, will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow. If it feels threatened, the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed, flying only when the intruder is [...] away. It may call or wing clap as it goes, and land as far as [...] from where it was flushed.

40|$|Abstract: This review {{will look}} at the {{empirical}} evidence for each of four solutions migratory birds have to adjust to the advancement of spring. The four solutions are: (1) increased migration speed, (2) advanced departure from the <b>wintering</b> <b>areas,</b> (3) northward shift of the <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> and (4) prolonged northward spring migration. Empirical evidence was found for the first three of the solutions, but not for a prolonged northward spring migration. The effectiveness of the solutions and the type of solution however, varied greatly between species, populations and geographical areas. This review also shows that there are constraints for each solution. Due to a lack of data en route and from the <b>wintering</b> <b>areas,</b> it not possible to fully understand the mechanisms behind these changes, phenotypic or evolutionary response, and to say which solutions are likely to be better, or if perhaps all are needed. So a lot more research on en route conditions and <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> needs to be done, to make future predictions of the adjustment of migratory birds to the advancement of spring. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{approaches}} {{were taken}} to link breeding and <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> of Red-winged Blackbirds: (1) banding in <b>wintering</b> <b>areas,</b> (2) banding nestlings, and (3) banding territorial males. Information gained from the first two approaches was meager compared to the manpower involved. The third approach was to capture, band, and color-tag male Redwings on northern breeding territories and then search for the birds the following winter in known roosts and surrounding feeding areas to the south. The third approach was very productive. It resulted in the linking of Redwing breeding areas in Wyoming and Montana with <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> in Colorado. Infor- mation similar to that obtained from trapping in Wyoming and Montana can probably be obtained on other Redwing populations by following the third approach...|$|R

40|$|North American {{populations of}} white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca deglandi) have {{declined}} markedly {{over the past}} several decades. The causes for decline are uncertain, but likely involve a complexity of events occurring on <b>wintering</b> and breeding <b>areas.</b> To gain insight into potential cross-seasonal effects, I delineated Atlantic and Pacific wintering scoter populations and linked them to a shared breeding area using stable isotope analysis of carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) ratios in feathers. By applying this methodology to a marked breeding population at Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan, I assigned females to putative <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> and determined: (1) population structure; (2) the extent of winter site philopatry; and, (3) differences in vital rates and other variates in relation to winter origin. Discriminant function analysis of isotopic ratios in feather samples from known wintering locations resulted in classification probabilities of 96 % (n = 149) for Pacific and 78 % (n = 32) for Atlantic wintering scoters. Using this methodology, I determined that the Redberry Lake breeding population is comprised of approximately 75 % Pacific and 25 % Atlantic wintering birds, and its members exhibit high degrees of winter region philopatry based on the classification of successive recaptures over three field seasons. Annual variations in population structure, as well as differences in nest initiation dates and blood contaminant loads in relation to <b>winter</b> <b>area</b> suggest seasonal interactions may influence survival and reproductive success of this population. To gain insight into potential seasonal interactions, I examined nest success and female survival in relation to <b>winter</b> <b>area.</b> No significant differences in nest success in relation to <b>winter</b> <b>area</b> were found, but nests that failed before mid-incubation were not sampled. Adult female survival rate for 2000 - 2004 was estimated as 0. 85, with no significant difference detected between <b>wintering</b> <b>areas.</b> This study demonstrated {{that it is important to}} link breeding and <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> to better understand the factors influencing population dynamics and to effectively address conservation issues...|$|R

Further waterfowl converge here before departing to breeding grounds in western Palearctic region. In addition, the wetland is a <b>wintering</b> <b>area</b> for massive congregations of waterfowl.

40|$|The {{northern}} pintail (hereafter pintail) {{is a common}} dabbling duck distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Since 1955, the breeding population in North America has averaged 5, 566, 000, fluctuating between 10, 124, 000 (1956) and 2, 471, 000 (1989; Fig. 1). Pintail numbers are especially sensitive to habitat conditions that reflect the wet–dry cycle in the shortgrass prairie breeding areas of south-central Canada and the northern Great Plains of the United States. Populations of pintails also are affected by habitat conditions in key <b>wintering</b> <b>areas,</b> such as the Central Valley of California and Gulf Coast marshes. When <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> are fairly dry, birds have fewer resources and subsequent spring recruitment is lowered. Through the 1970 ’s, continental populations recovered when wetland conditions on breeding and <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> were good but fell when the prairies were dry and wetland conditions in <b>wintering</b> <b>areas</b> were poor. Unfortunately, habitat losses and degradation of prairie habitats caused by agricultural practices have coincided with prolonged drought since the early 1980 ’s. This combination of detrimental factors resulted in declining pintail numbers in the past decade. The long-term downward trend in pintail numbers has focused renewed attention on this species. This leaflet describes aspects of pintail life history that may be important for pintail management. It is not intended as a general reference on pintail biology.
