5|$|Later that day, Lane storms into a partners' meeting, {{shouting}} at Pete about how Edwin's wife has {{found out about}} Edwin's adultery and is devastated; Edwin has withdrawn his business as a result. Lane blames Pete's methods for losing the account, and Pete responds by citing Lane's redundant role at the firm and challenging his sexuality. To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave. She instead stays with Lane and forgives his blunder, claiming that he'd done to Pete <b>what</b> <b>everyone</b> in the office had wanted to do for some time.|$|E

He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's <b>what</b> <b>everyone</b> called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part.

Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand <b>what</b> <b>everyone</b> agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E
25|$|Of the 27 {{books in}} the New Testament, 14 have been {{attributed}} to Paul; 7 of these are widely considered authentic and Paul's own, while the authorship of the other 7 is disputed. The undisputed letters are considered the most important sources since they contain <b>what</b> <b>everyone</b> agrees to be Paul's own statements about his life and thoughts. Theologian Mark Powell writes that Paul directed these 7 letters to specific occasions at particular churches. As an example, if the Corinthian church had not experienced problems concerning its celebration of the Lord's Supper, today we would not know that Paul even believed in that observance or had any opinions about it one way or the other. He asks if we might be ignorant of other matters simply because no crises arose that prompted Paul to comment on them.|$|E

So I just would read things that were happening with Ed and Peg. She's so tunnel-visioned about her goals and what needs to happen that I didn't want to think about the whole show.

A {{majority of the}} work for the video was done by AJR, including directing and producing. The EP {{was released}} instead of their debut album, Living Room, which was pushed back to a release date of March 3, 2015. The band expressed that the delay in their debut album was {{because they wanted to}} add some of their newer music to the project.

Craig Taborn Trio, with bassist Jaribu Shahid and drummer Tani Tabbal, featured Taborn playing {{in a range of}} styles on piano and included several of his own compositions. At this stage in his career, his comments on his tastes in composition and performance were: [...] "Even though I like avant garde jazz and classical music, I like to swing. I like to work with harmony and melody in my own music, and I like acoustical instruments. But I can be quite dictatorial about the composed section, and lay down in great detail <b>what</b> <b>everyone</b> is supposed to do and how they should do it." ...|$|E

500|$|Jansch's music, and {{particularly}} his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced {{a range of}} well-known musicians. His first album (Bert Jansch, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, [...] "At one point, I was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP, I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of <b>what</b> <b>everyone</b> else was doing. No one in America could touch that." [...] The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental [...] "Angie." [...] This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) The Sallyangie.|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 interview, Peter Buck {{described}} typical R.E.M. songs as, [...] "Minor key, mid-tempo, enigmatic, semi-folk-rock-balladish things. That's <b>what</b> <b>everyone</b> thinks and to {{a certain}} degree, that's true." [...] All songwriting is credited to the entire band, even though individual members are sometimes responsible for writing the majority of a particular song. Each member is given an equal vote in the songwriting process; however, Buck has conceded that Stipe, as the band's lyricist, can rarely be persuaded to follow an idea he does not favor. Among the original line-up, there were divisions of labor in the songwriting process: Stipe would write lyrics and devise melodies, Buck would edge the band in new musical directions, and Mills and Berry would fine-tune the compositions due to their greater musical experience.|$|E

However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E

Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs.
