Butterfly is angry, but soon succumbs to her lust for Pinkerton. [...] All five individuals have sexual intercourse. Pink-hop engages in receptive anal intercourse with Pinkerton and Sharpless while performing cunnilingus on the women.

2500|$|To the end, Guiteau was {{actively}} {{making plans to}} start a lecture tour after his perceived imminent release and {{to run for president}} himself in 1884, while <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time continuing to delight in the media circus surrounding his trial. He was dismayed when the jury was unconvinced of his divine inspiration, convicting him of the murder. He was found guilty on January 25, 1882. He appealed, but his appeal was rejected, and he was hanged on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia. At his execution, Guiteau famously danced his way up to the gallows and while on <b>the</b> scaffold he <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> shook hands with his executioner and, as a last request, recited a poem he had written called [...] "I am Going to the Lordy". He requested an orchestra to play as he sang the poem; it was denied.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the end of}} the 1993-1994 season, {{having already}} lost star cast member Dana Carvey, who left midway through the {{previous}} season, SNL's 1994 post-season saw more departures. Julia Sweeney left due to frustration and burnout. Another departure was that of Phil Hartman, whose final moment on the show {{was at the end of}} a musical number, with the entire cast singing a parody of the [...] "So Long, Farewell" [...] song from The Sound of Music. After all of the cast had left the stage, Farley, in his Matt Foley character, was left sitting on the stage, with Phil walking back on stage, cuddling next to Farley to sing goodbye and <b>waving</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E

50|$|While {{teaching}} in Guam, Ric supplemented {{his free time}} playing music at local beach bars and night clubs with his younger brother Gordon. Gordon was always frustrated by Ric's refusal to practice and his outright willingness to play a song {{that they had never}} played before. By doing this, Ric was trying to sharpen his brother Gordon's chops and musical prowess. Which in a sense worked but Gordon still had to endure many embarrassing moments. Ric was also known for having Gordon start a set and then even before the first verse was started Ric would say, “I'll be right back”. Well into the song Gordon would find Ric sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bar enjoying a beer and happily <b>waving</b> <b>at</b> him from <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> band Ric and Gordon started was called the Bunelos Brothers, (name provided by Gordon). Ric being the professional he was thought that name was perfect for their little music project. Not too serious but just serious enough to provoke controversy. And besides, everyone loves Bunelos! The Bunelos Brothers were a regular feature at Tahiti Rama, Barney's Beach House and The Signature Pub. Their repertoire consisted mainly of Beatles music, easy listing tunes, MOR, and ballads. Their voices were homogenous and harmonies came very easily for them. Just like brothers all over the globe, not every decision was 100% mutual. There were fights on stage but most of them were mainly scowling looks and failures to sing back up. In some cases Gordon would get even with Ric and refuse to play. Ric would give his brother the “I’m going to kill you look” but Gordon knew his bark was worse than his bite. The Bunelos Brothers played together for 3 years going through an assortment of other members, including their eldest brother Goff.|$|R
