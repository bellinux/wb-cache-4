5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was a heavily {{modified version of}} the Chapman strut, originally developed for Chapman's earlier Formula racing car designs and used in the Lotus Elan. In the Europa, the vertical [...] "strut" [...] element pivots on the wheel hub at its lower end and doesn't control <b>wheel</b> <b>camber</b> angle as-in earlier Lotus designs. Wheel location and alignment is controlled instead by interaction between a fixed-length, articulated driveshaft top link, a simple tubular lower link, and a large box-section radius arm running diagonally forward to the chassis. These radius arms {{played a critical role in}} giving the precise tracking and handling desired, as the Chapman Strut's use of the driveshaft to resist lateral forces was compromised by the rubber engine and transaxle mounts needed to isolate vibrations from the car body. A careful compromise between the radius arm mount's stiffness, isolation and car handling was required, culminating eventually in a sandwich bush that was flexible against shear but stiff in compression and tension. The car's subsequent resulting handling prompted automotive writers to describe the Europa as the nearest thing to a Formula car for the road.|$|E

This layout also had better interior space utilisation than front engine rear-wheel-drive cars, and a better ride than those with a live rear beam axle. It was an affordable way to produce a car with all round independent suspension, without the need for expensive constant-velocity joints needed by front-wheel-drive cars, or axle arrangements of FR layout cars. They could have road-holding issues due to unfavorable weight distribution and <b>wheel</b> <b>camber</b> changes (rear wheel tuck under), of the lower-cost swing axle rear suspension design. These were highlighted and a little exaggerated by Ralph Nader. These problems were ameliorated on later Beetles and were eliminated on the second-generation Chevrolet Corvair with the switch to a four-link, fully independent rear suspension. The Hillman Imp, NSU Prinz and Soviet Zaporozhets all had styling cues derived from the original Corvair. Connections to the Corvair are mentioned on their respective Wikipages. The only economy cars with this layout launched since the 1960s have been the turn of the millennium ultra compact two seater city car Smart Fortwo and Indian market Tata Nano.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to design and build an after-market suspension for the rear wheels of a manual wheelchair. Suspension for wheelchairs is important because it has been reported that the International Organization for Standards 2 ̆ 7 requirements for vibration loads on wheelchair users (ISO 2631 - 1), are not meet by today 2 ̆ 7 s standard wheelchairs. Today 2 ̆ 7 s wheelchairs need to be able to absorb everyday shock loads, thereby minimizing the energy transmitted to the user. The chosen design is based around the concept of adding shock reduction material between the hub of the wheel, and the axel bolt that connects the wheel to the frame of the chair. The approach taken was to design a suspension system that resides between an oversized wheel bearing, and the axle. To do this, ball-race bearings with an inner diameter of 42 ̆ 2 were chosen, and polyurethane rubber was used as the shock absorbing material. Pro-Mechanica, a finite element analysis program, was used to analyze the suspension system. Since the most common camber/tilt for wheelchair wheels is three degrees from the vertical, the anticipated loads were applied to the wheel at this angle. A prototype of the suspension system was constructed to verify that the design would work, but no tests were performed on it. This analysis showed that the suspension system should not fail when subjected to 10 times the static load. This load was considered large enough to encompass the forces that a wheelchair chair wheel is typically subjected to.

40|$|Vehicle {{handling}} is an {{area where}} vehicle manufacturers constantly seek improvement. However it has been traditionally regarded as an area where improvement is seen to come at the cost of vehicle ride quality. Even though much work has been done in this area, {{only a limited number of}} studies have considered decoupling the body roll effects on <b>wheel</b> <b>camber</b> change, thus improving roadholding capabilities. Whilst several of the adaptive or active suspension systems, control damping effects to improve ride, vehicle manufacturers also now use electronic systems to improve vehicle stability and handling characteristics. Some of these may even include suspension systems that maintain or adapt <b>wheel</b> <b>camber.</b> Although current examples ofsuch suspension systems aim to either reduce body roll or camber change, they cannot meet both conditions simultaneously during independent wheel travel. ill order to understand the true benefits of camber control, a suspension system that can have such camber control activated and deactivated, should be considered for comparative purposes. Such study would be quite expensive and a time consuming challenge if it were to be done in the real world, especially if the benefits and feasibility are not yet clear today to help justify any funding requirements. For this reason a suspension concept is proposed, investigated through computer modelling techniques and is outlined In this report. The concept consists ofhaving the upper control arm of a suspension system adapt its length, with the use of intelligent. hydraulically actuated control systems, thus maintaining the set <b>wheel</b> <b>camber</b> angle, during independent wheel travel. A. literature survey has been conducted, investigating previous work that has been. carried out in this area of research. An initial study has also been conducted in the available technologies relating to the proposed concept. Computer modelling techniques have also been acquired and implemented by the author, to produce a fully functional virtual prototype of a vehicle, using a selected multibody systems (MBS) program. However, MBS tools often do not include the means to define and solve complex hydraulic and control system effects. Therefore investigations into the best approach. of solving integrated MBS models with complex system models were required and developed. Several simulations, including step-steer, sme, swept-sine and ISO-lane change manoeuvres have been run and validated on a benchmarked vehicle. These were later compared to results of simulations with the proposed concept implemented on a modified vehicle model. The unique approach developed to solve the combined MBS and complex hydraulic and control systems, has proven significant benefits for vehicle dynamics analysis, whilst the above mentioned concept of maintaining camber angle has proved to be quite feasible with some benefit to vehicle handling.

50|$|The {{drawbacks}} {{are that}} it does not allow each wheel to move independently in response to bumps, and the mass of the beam is part of the unsprung weight of the vehicle, which can further reduce ride quality. Also the cornering ability is typically worse than other suspension designs because the <b>wheels</b> have zero <b>camber</b> angle gain during body roll. Front beam axle suspension is also unusually sensitive to any lack of concentricity in the hub and wheel assembly which can cause a side-to-side oscillation ("shimmy") of the steering at certain speeds (typically 40-50 mph). This is addressed on some vehicles with steering dampers although removal and careful refitting of the front wheels often cures the problem.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The rear-wheel camber, {{defined as}} the {{inclination}} of the rear wheels, is usually used in wheelchair sports, but {{it is becoming increasingly}} employed in daily propulsion. Although the rear-wheel camber can increase stability, it alters physiological performance during propulsion. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of rear-wheel cambers on temporal-spatial parameters, joint angles, and propulsion patterns. Methods Twelve inexperienced subjects (22. 3 ± 1. 6 yr) participated in the study. None had musculoskeletal disorders in their upper extremities. An eight-camera motion capture system was used to collect the three-dimensional trajectory data of markers attached to the wheelchair-user system during propulsion. All participants propelled the same wheelchair, which had an instrumented <b>wheel</b> with <b>cambers</b> of 0 °, 9 °, and 15 °, respectively, at an average velocity of 1 m/s. Results The results show that the rear-wheel camber significantly affects the average acceleration, maximum end angle, trunk movement, elbow joint movement, wrist joint movement, and propulsion pattern. The effects are especially significant between 0 ° and 15 °. For a 15 ° camber, the average acceleration and joint peak angles significantly increased (p Conclusions The rear-wheel camber affects propulsion patterns and joint range of motion.

40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} {{determination of}} a vehicle's lateral behaviour {{is necessary in}} the domain of vehicle dynamics to improve vehicle safety. Its interaction with the road surface must be understood thoroughly, which requires the integration of a force model, representing the tyre-ground interface, into the global vehicle model. The validity of such a model directly depends on its nature and more particularly on the accurate determination of its inputs and outputs. This paper focuses on one input: the <b>wheel</b> <b>camber</b> angle. Studies in collaboration with a car maker have shown that a measurement error below 0. 1 ◦ is necessary to identify the tyre model parameters from real data accurately. At the same time, measurement performance must be insensitive to the test conditions, and more particularly to the road surface (tyre-road grip). For these reasons, a novel vision-based method for direct camber determination has been developed and a measurement prototype has been designed. Its vision-based principle is mainly aimed at giving accurate measurement. Its precision is robust to the road's unevenness and the vehicle's velocity; the tyre loaded radius is determined at the same time.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} first {{investigate}} synchronous (SYN) versus asynchronous (ASY) {{mode of propulsion}} and, second, investigate the <b>wheel</b> <b>camber</b> effects on sprinting performance as well as temporal parameters. Seven wheelchair basketball players performed four maximal eight-second sprints on a wheelchair ergometer. They repeated the test according to two modes of propulsion (SYN and ASY) and two wheel cambers (9 ° and 15 °). The mean maximal velocity and push power output was greater in the synchronous mode compared to the asynchronous mode for both camber angles. However, the fluctuation in the velocity profile is inferior for ASY versus SYN mode for both camber angles. Greater push time/cycle time (Pt/Ct) and arm frequency (AF) for synchronous mode versus asynchronous mode and inversely, lesser Ct and rest time (Rt) values for the synchronous mode, for which greater velocity were observed. SYN mode leads to better performance than ASY mode in terms of maximal propulsion velocity. However, ASY propulsion allows greater continuity of the hand-rim force application, reducing fluctuations in the velocity profile. The camber angle {{had no effect on}} ASY and SYN mean maximal velocity and push power output. The study of wheelchair propulsion strategies is important for better understanding physiological and biomechanical impacts of wheelchair propulsion for individuals with disabilities. From a kinematical point of view, this study highlights synchronous mode of propulsion to be more efficient, with regards to mean maximal velocity reaching during maximal sprinting exercises.

In order to effectively refine the user interphase design of the wheelchair, it is essential to narrow down the key dimensions within the design space, which are likely to {{have an effect on the}} performance of an individual athlete. This paper provides a case study analysis of the test data obtained from five elite wheelchair rugby athletes, using a purpose-built adjustable wheelchair on a wheelchair ergometer. Four design factors (<b>wheel</b> diameter, <b>camber</b> angle, seat height, and camber bar depth) were tested at incremental dimensional levels to the athlete's current chair configuration; and tests were performed according to an L 9 Taguchi orthogonal array. The case study analyzes acceleration, velocity, and time in the push phase of the propulsion cycle; as well as recovery time for each of the participating athletes performing a linear sprint task. The Taguchi method is applied to determining the positive/negative contribution of each of the four design factors to the outlined performance variables as well as their combined effect in a specific wheelchair configuration model. A performance ranking system and magnitude-based inferences on the true value of the effect statistic are used to define a high performance design space for individual athlete wheelchairs. Finally, the athlete's preferred ergonomics are considered to assess the narrowed high performance wheelchair options. As such, when adopting the approach presented in this paper, it becomes possible to customize an athlete's wheelchair design to meet the athlete's anthropometric needs as well as their performance requirements...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{vehicles}} {{are designed to}} deal with traffic problems, air pollution, energy consumption, and parking limitations in large cities. They are smaller and narrower than conventional vehicles, and thus more susceptible to rollover and stability issues. This thesis explores the unique dynamic behavior of narrow urban vehicles and different control actuation for vehicle stability to develop new reconfigurable and integrated control strategies for safe and reliable operations of urban vehicles. A novel reconfigurable vehicle model is introduced for the analysis and design of any urban vehicle configuration and also its stability control with any actuation arrangement. The proposed vehicle model provides modeling of four-wheeled (4 W) vehicles and three- wheeled (3 W) vehicles in Tadpole and Delta configurations in one set of equations. The vehicle model is also reconfigurable {{in the sense that}} different configurations of control actuation can be accommodated for controller design. To develop the reconfigurable vehicle model, two reconfiguration matrices are introduced; the corner and actuator reconfiguration matrices that are responsible for wheel and actuator configurations, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed model properly matches the high-fidelity CarSim models for 3 W and 4 W vehicles. Rollover stability is particularly important for narrow urban vehicles. This thesis investigates the rollover stability of three-wheeled vehicles including the effects of road angles and road bumps. A new rollover index (RI) is introduced, which works for various road conditions including tripped and un-tripped rollovers on flat and sloped roads. The proposed RI is expressed in terms of measurable vehicle parameters and state variables. In addition to the effects of the lateral acceleration and roll angle, the proposed RI accounts for the effects of the longitudinal acceleration and the pitch angle, as well as the effects of road angles. Lateral and vertical road inputs are also considered since they can represent the effects of curbs, soft soil, and road bumps as the main causes of tripped rollovers. Sensitivity analysis is provided to evaluate and compare the effects of different vehicle parameters and state variables on rollover stability of 3 W vehicles. A high-fidelity CarSim model for a 3 W vehicle has been used for simulation and evaluation of the proposed RI accuracy. As a potentially useful mechanism for urban vehicles, <b>wheel</b> <b>cambering</b> is also investigated in this study to improve both lateral and rollover stability of narrow vehicles. A suspension system with active camber has an additional degree of freedom for changing the camber angle through which vehicle handling and stability can be improved. Conventionally, camber has been known for its ability to increase lateral forces. In this thesis, the benefits of cambering for rollover stability of narrow {{vehicles are}} also investigated and compared with a vehicle tilt mechanism. The simulation results indicate that active camber systems can improve vehicle lateral stability and rollover behavior. Furthermore, by utilizing more friction forces near the limits, the active camber system provides more improvement in maneuverability and lateral stability than the active front steering does. The proposed reconfigurable vehicle model leads us {{to the development of a}} general integrated reconfigurable control structure. The reconfigurable integrated controller can be used to meet different stability objectives of 4 W and 3 W vehicles with flexible combinations of control actuation. Employing the reconfigurable vehicle model, the proposed unified controller renders reconfigurability and can be easily adapted to Tadpole and Delta configurations of 3 W as well as 4 W vehicles without reformulating the problem. Different types and combinations of actuators can be selected for the control design including or combination of differential braking, torque vectoring, active front steering, active rear steering, and active camber system. The proposed structure provides integrated control of the main stability objectives including handling improvement, lateral stability, traction/braking control, and rollover prevention. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is used to develop the reconfigurable controller. The performance of the introduced controller has been evaluated through CarSim simulations for different vehicles and control actuation configurations...|$|R
