5000|$|Signal <b>whips</b> (or signalwhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed <b>whip,</b> {{originally}} designed to control dog teams. A signal <b>whip</b> usually measures between 3 and 4 feet in length. Signal <b>whips</b> and snake <b>whips</b> are similar. What distinguishes a signal <b>whip</b> from a snake <b>whip</b> {{is the absence of}} a [...] "fall". A fall is a piece of leather attached {{to the end of the}} body of the <b>whip.</b> In a snake <b>whip,</b> the [...] "cracker" [...] attaches to the fall. In a signal <b>whip,</b> the cracker attaches directly to the body of the <b>whip.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Government Chief <b>Whip</b> is {{assisted}} by the Deputy Chief <b>Whip,</b> other <b>Whips,</b> and Assistant <b>Whips.</b> In {{order to give}} them a salary for what is in essence a party office, the government <b>whips</b> are appointed to positions in HM Treasury and in the Royal Household under the Lord Steward of the Household. The <b>whips</b> are not fully active in either of these departments, though do undertake a number of responsibilities. The Deputy Chief <b>Whip</b> is Treasurer of HM Household, the next two <b>Whips</b> are Comptroller of HM Household and Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household, and the remaining <b>Whips</b> are Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. Assistant <b>Whips,</b> and <b>Whips</b> of opposition parties, generally do not receive such appointments.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} The Chain <b>Whip,</b> this may refer to the hard <b>whip</b> (more akin to a {{truncheon}} than a multi-section <b>whip)</b> due to the ambiguity in the Chinese. [...] "Both the hard <b>whip</b> and the soft <b>whip</b> can both be referred to simply as <b>whip</b> (鞭) in Chinese.". Different books make wildly differing claims {{about the history of}} the Chain <b>Whip.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hot chocolate, {{also known}} as hot cocoa, {{drinking}} chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with <b>whipped</b> cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.|$|E
5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} prosecution witness, a servant {{of one of}} the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. In the face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, <b>whipped,</b> and banished from the province.|$|E
5|$|Appeals to nonviolent {{resistance}} were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, {{a recently}} appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was <b>whipped,</b> tarred, and feathered. Because {{of these and}} other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E
50|$|The <b>whip</b> cracker spins the <b>whip</b> {{anti-clockwise}} (if right-handed) {{over his}} or her head. When the <b>whip</b> is approximately 90 degrees {{to the right of}} the <b>whip</b> cracker, he or she swings the <b>whip</b> in the opposite direction. It is one of the simplest techniques, yet it can be one of the loudest used in <b>whip</b> cracking.|$|R
50|$|That {{arrangement}} persists today. Labor and the Liberals {{each have}} a chief <b>whip</b> and two <b>whips</b> in the House of Representatives and a chief <b>whip</b> and a two deputy <b>whips</b> in the Senate. The Nationals have a chief <b>whip</b> and <b>whip</b> in the House and one <b>whip</b> in the Senate. In addition, the Greens have had a <b>whip</b> in the Senate since May 1995. Other parties have also had <b>whips.</b> When the Democratic Labor Party (now the Democratic Labour Party) increased from two to four senators in July 1968, it elected a <b>whip</b> who served until he {{and the rest of}} the DLP senators lost their seats at the 1974 double dissolution election. The Australian Democrats had a <b>whip</b> from 1981 until 2008, when all four senators left office following their loss at the 2007 election.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>whipping</b> is the {{simplest}} type of <b>whipping</b> knot, {{a series of}} knots intended to stop a rope from unravelling. As it can slip off the rope easily, the common <b>whipping</b> {{should not be used}} for rope ends that will be handled. This <b>whipping</b> knot is also called 'wolf' <b>whipping</b> {{in some parts of the}} world. The 'Hangman's knot' is a variation of this <b>whipping</b> knot.|$|R
5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} and <b>whipped</b> by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2001, Burger King began {{promotions}} for the film, {{giving out}} {{a selection of}} nine exclusive Candy Caddies based on the Shrek characters, in Big Kids Meal and Kids Meal orders. Ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins also ran an 8-week promotion of the film, selling products such as Shrek's Hot Sludge Sundae, a combination of Oreo Cookies 'n Cream ice cream, hot fudge, crushed chocolate cookies, <b>whipped</b> cream and squiggly gummy worms, and Shrek Freeze Frame Cake, featuring an image of Shrek and Donkey framed by sunflowers. This was to support the film's DVD/VHS release.|$|E
5|$|Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose {{name has}} {{become synonymous with}} greed. He is arguably the novel's main antagonist. His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his {{religious}} faith; he eventually orders Tom <b>whipped</b> to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.|$|E
50|$|By 1994, {{all three}} major {{parties in the}} House of Representatives had a <b>whip</b> and a deputy <b>whip,</b> but only the National Party's deputy <b>whip</b> did not receive an {{additional}} salary. On 12 May 1994, Kim Beazley, then the Leader of the House, announced that, {{in conjunction with the}} creation of the second debating chamber, the Government <b>Whip</b> in the House of Representatives would become the Chief Government <b>Whip,</b> and his deputy would become the Government <b>Whip.</b> In addition, a second junior <b>whip</b> would be added. Beazley offered the same arrangement for the Liberal Party and to see that the Nationals' deputy received a salary. Labor elected its <b>whip</b> that day, and the Liberals appointed an additional <b>whip</b> on 2 June 1994, with the new <b>whip</b> responsible for business in the second chamber.|$|R

5|$|The Boston News-Letter of 9 July 1722 {{published}} {{a list of}} those captured by Low. A number of the fishermen were forced to join Low, including Philip Ashton, who escaped in May 1723 on Roatán Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and who wrote {{a detailed account of}} life aboard Low's pirate ship. Before Ashton's escape, he had been beaten, <b>whipped,</b> kept in chains, and threatened with death many times, as he refused to sign Low's articles and become a pirate.|$|E
5|$|The group {{travelled}} north, passing present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, {{on the way}} to a Mingo {{village on}} the north side of the Mad River, somewhere near present-day Logan County, Ohio. During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found burdensome. Martin responded by screaming in grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they <b>whipped</b> her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought his black hair would allow him to pass as an Indian.|$|E
5|$|The series won several {{international}} advertising {{awards for}} BBH. The brand's creaminess was emphasised through {{items such as}} face cream, ice cream, sun cream and <b>whipped</b> cream. Managing director of Whitbread, Miles Templeman, explained that: We were thinking how to turn a second-rate north-west brand into something more stylish, {{to make it more}} appealing again. BBH thought of focusing on the creamy aspect, of selling a beer like a face cream. A previously unknown Melanie Sykes launched her career as a television presenter following her appearances in the adverts from 1996 until 1999.|$|E

50|$|Snake <b>whips</b> (or snakewhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed <b>whip.</b> The name snake <b>whip</b> {{is derived}} from the fact that this type of <b>whip</b> has no handle inside and so can be curled up into a small circle which resembles a coiled snake. They were once {{commonly}} carried in the saddlebag by cowboys of the old west. A full sized snake <b>whip</b> is usually at least 4 feet in length (excluding the fall and cracker {{at the tip of the}} <b>whip)</b> and around one inch in diameter at the butt of the <b>whip.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were <b>whipped</b> up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued their attempts to control and punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional elections. and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war. The Communist victory of China in 1949 {{and the start of}} the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti-Communist hysteria being <b>whipped</b> up at the time.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or <b>whipped</b> cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
50|$|Labor elected {{its first}} deputy Senate <b>whip</b> in 1962.

5|$|In the United States and Canada, {{the drink}} is popular in instant form, made {{with hot water}} or milk from a packet {{containing}} mostly cocoa powder, sugar, and dry milk. This is the thinner of the two main variations. It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows, <b>whipped</b> cream, {{or a piece of}} solid chocolate. Hot chocolate was first brought to North America as early as the 17th century by the Dutch, but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755. Traditionally, hot chocolate has been associated with cold weather, winter, and dessert in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Later in the morning, Ike {{picked up}} his rifle and {{revolver}} from the West End Corral, where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town. By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol <b>whipped</b> him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held.|$|E
5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned <b>whipped</b> cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E

5000|$|While {{references}} to assistant or deputy <b>whips</b> in the Australian Parliament sometimes appeared in early press reporting, {{just when the}} concept of a deputy <b>whip</b> emerged, or how formal the position initially was, is unclear. For example, Alfred Conroy was described in a news report in 1903 as Labor's assistant <b>whip,</b> and when the Labor <b>Whip</b> Jim Page died in 1921, press reports stated that [...] "the Deputy Whip", James Fenton, would act as <b>whip</b> until a new <b>whip</b> was elected.
