2500|$|Colbert's {{campaign}} touted him as South Carolina's native or {{favorite son}} candidate, running exclusively {{in that state}} and exclusively for that state's interests. [...] "I am from South Carolina and I am for South Carolina and I defy any other candidate to pander more {{to the people of}} South Carolina, those beautiful, beautiful people," [...] he said after his Colbert Report announcement. As such, he challenged Democratic candidate John Edwards'—himself a native South Carolinian—own prospective role. As Colbert began campaigning in South Carolina in late October, Edwards' spokesperson Teresa Wells teased Colbert about his sponsorship by Doritos nacho chips: [...] "As the candidate of Doritos, his hands are stained by corporate corruption and nacho cheese. John Edwards has never taken a dime from taco chip lobbyists and America deserves a President who isn't in the pocket of the snack food special interests." [...] The Edwards team also released a press release responding to Colbert directly: [...] "Edwards was born in South Carolina, learned to walk in South Carolina, learned to talk to in South Carolina and <b>will</b> <b>kick</b> Stephen Colbert's New York City butt in South Carolina." [...] One commentator suggested the humorous response might aid Edwards' image by presenting him as a candidate who could [...] "make fun of himself". In addition, Edwards booked American film actor and celebrity Danny Glover to stump for him in South Carolina on the same day Colbert was making his appearance in the state; a chance at a [...] "perfect political salvo", in the opinion of one reporter, although one left underexploited.|$|E

In a game full of sexy, fatalistic fighters, separating from the pack is a truly impressive feat. And Kasumi has done just that." [...] The Age ranked her 36th on its 2008 list of the top 50 Xbox characters of all time and PC Games Hardware listed her {{as one of the}} most important female characters in video game history. GameDaily featured her in a 2009 article about gaming's [...] "greatest patriots" [...] and stated that [...] "it's hard to imagine a video game world without the lovely Kasumi."

In 2012, WatchMojo.com ranked her as the ninth most iconic fighting game character, calling her an arguably perfect woman, while The Daily Observer included her among the 32 candidates for “ultimate fighting game champion”. WatchMojo.com placed [...] "this beautiful redhead" [...] who [...] "wipes the floor with her opponents thanks to her speed" [...] fifth in their 2014 ranking of top female fighting game characters.
