25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the accident had been caused by the baggage door becoming lodged {{on the leading edge}} of the right tailplane after it had opened and detached. This changed the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics so that it became uncontrollable. This in turn resulted in overstressing of the wings and tailplane leading to inflight structural failure, with both wings and tailplane detaching from the fuselage. Contributory factors were the mis-rigged state of the door operating mechanism, which allowed the top and bottom pairs of catches to lose synchronisation, and failure of the door <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> to give the crew enough time to respond to door safety alerts.|$|E

5000|$|The field {{windings}} are supplied with {{power from the}} battery via the ignition switch and regulator. A parallel circuit supplies the [...] "charge" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> and is earthed via the regulator (which is why the indicator is on when the ignition is on but the engine is not running). Once the engine is running and the alternator is generating power, a diode feeds the field current from the alternator main output equalizing the voltage across the <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> which goes off. The wire supplying the field current {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "exciter" [...] wire. The drawback of this arrangement is that if the warning lamp burns out or the [...] "exciter" [...] wire is disconnected, no current reaches the {{field windings}} and the alternator will not generate power. Some <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> circuits are equipped with a resistor in parallel with the lamp that permit excitation current to flow if the warning lamp burns out. The driver should check that the <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> is on when the engine is stopped; otherwise, there might not be any indication of a failure of the belt which may also drive the cooling water pump. Some alternators will self-excite when the engine reaches a certain speed.|$|R

50|$|To {{address the}} time {{dimension}} of risk, a wide set of variables are typically used, for instance: ratio {{of credit to}} GDP, real asset prices, ratio of non-core to core liabilities of the banking sector, and monetary aggregates. Some early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> have been developed encompassing these and other pieces of financial data (see, e.g., Borio and Drehmann, 2009).

5000|$|The first XB-47 was {{rolled out}} on 12 September 1947, {{a few days}} before the USAAF became a {{separate}} service, the U.S. Air Force, on 18 September 1947.

It flew from Boeing Field in Seattle to the Moses Lake Airfield in central Washington state, in a flight that lasted just 27 minutes, with no major problems.

5000|$|To {{respond to}} the {{challenges}} facing public education, City Year AmeriCorps members work in schools full-time providing academic support and after school programming. These school partnerships work within a framework known as Whole School, Whole Child (WSWC). This program has several components, aimed at improving school attendance, student behavior, and course performance in English and Mathematics. These three factors, called the [...] "ABCs", are prominent early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of students at risk of dropping out of high school. According to the study, a student who exhibits even one of these indicators as early as sixth grade has a 25% chance of graduating with their peers.

5000|$|Flight {{simulators}} {{are also}} used by aircraft manufacturers to test new hardware. By connecting a simulated cockpit with visual screen to a real flight control system in a laboratory, integrating the pilot with the electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic components that exist on the real aircraft, a complete system evaluation can be conducted prior to initial flight testing. This type of testing allows the simulation of [...] "seeded faults" [...] (i.e. an intentional hydraulic leak, software error, or computer shutdown) which serve to validate that an aircraft's redundant design features work as intended. A test pilot can also help identify system deficiencies such as inadequate or missing <b>warning</b> <b>indicators,</b> or even unintended control stick motion. This testing is necessary to simulate extremely high risk events that cannot be conducted in flight but nonetheless must be demonstrated. While 6 degree-of-freedom motion is not necessary {{for this type of}} testing, the visual screen allows the pilot to [...] "fly" [...] the aircraft while the faults are simultaneously triggered.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1972 Sadat {{decided to}} launch war {{without waiting for}} these arms and Egypt {{accelerated}} its war preparations. Marwan reported on Sadat decision and the military preparations for war but personally he expressed the estimate that ultimately Egypt would be deterred from militarily challenging Israel. Nevertheless, in April he (as well as other Mossad sources), warned that Egypt planned to attack in mid-May. Israel raised its state-of military readiness, but war did not come, probably because President Assad of Syria convinced Sadat to delay it until Syria was better prepared to occupy the Golan Heights. Known in Israel as [...] "the Blue-White" [...] alert, this episode eroded Israeli fear of an Arab attack. Consequently, by fall 1973, when Egypt and Syria geared to war, military intelligence leaders, including Eli Zeira, refused to accept, despite numerous warnings and <b>warning</b> <b>indicators,</b> that the Arabs plan to attack. Accordingly, Israel’s leadership avoided the mobilization of the reserve army which in 1973 constituted 80% of the IDF ground forces.|$|E
50|$|Since October 2014, each month, he publishes {{with his}} team a Global Bubble Status Report, the FCO Cockpit, which {{discusses}} the historical evolution of bubbles in and between different asset classes and geographies. It {{is the result of}} an extensive analysis done on the historical time series of approximately 430 systemic assets and 835 single stocks worldwide. The systemic assets are bond, equity and commodity indices and a selection of currency pairs. The single stocks are mainly US and European, equities. The monthly FCO cockpit reports are usually divided into two parts: the first part presents the state of the world, based on the analysis of the systemic assets, including stock and bond indices, currencies and commodities; the second part zooms in on the bubble behavior of single stocks by calculating the bubble <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> as well as two financial strength indicators, which indicate the fundamental value of the stock and the growth capability respectively. The stocks are the constituents of the Stoxx Europe 600, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices. These indicators provide a stock classification into four quadrants: Quadrant 1: Stocks with a strong positive bubble score and a strong value score; Quadrant 2: Stocks with a strong positive bubble score and a weak value score; Quadrant 3: Stocks with a strong negative bubble score and a weak value score; Quadrant 4: Stocks with strong negative bubble score and a strong financial strength. These four quadrants are used to construct four benchmark portfolio each month and are followed to test for their performance. The goal is to establish a long track record to continue testing the FCO hypotheses.|$|E
