25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in <b>what</b> <b>sense</b> this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E

[...] Breyer further argued that [...] "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," [...] believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to [...] "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," [...] and that [...] "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression." [...] Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 Federal Trade Commission study.|$|E

2500|$|The ode praises {{children}} {{for being the}} [...] "best Philosopher" [...] ("lover of truth") because they live in truth and have prophetic abilities. This claim bothers Coleridge and he writes, in Biographia Literaria, that Wordsworth {{was trying to be}} a prophet in an area that he could have no claim to prophecy. In his analysis of the poem, Coleridge breaks down many aspects of Wordsworth's claims and asks, [...] "In <b>what</b> <b>sense</b> can the magnificent attributes, above quoted, be appropriated to a child, which would not make them equally suitable to a be, or a dog, or a field of corn: or even to a ship, or to the wind and waves that propel it?

[...] The knowledge of nature that Wordsworth thinks is wonderful in children, Coleridge feels is absurd in Wordsworth since a poet couldn't know how to make sense of a child's ability to sense the divine any more than the child with a limited understanding could know of the world. I. A.

At appeal the lower court's decision was upheld but the fine was reduced to €6,500, reportedly due to Williamson's financial circumstances.

2500|$|The early 20th century Oxford {{professor}} Samuel Rolles Driver {{taught that}} [...] sets out the fundamental truth of Israel's religion, the uniqueness and unity of God, and the fundamental duty founded upon it of the devotion to God of the Israelite's entire being. Reading [...] Driver asked in <b>what</b> <b>sense</b> the word [...] "One" [...] {{is to be}} understood: Does it express the Unity of God, declaring that God is in God's essence indivisible, and cannot — like Ba'al and Ashtoret, for instance, who are often spoken of in the plural — assume different phases or attributes, as presiding over different localities, or different departments of nature, and cannot further be united syncretistically with other deities; but is only known under the one character by which God has revealed God’s Self to Israel? Or does the word [...] "One" [...] denote the Uniqueness of God, representing God in a unique sense, as the God with whom no other god can be compared, as the only Deity to whom the true attributes of the Godhead really belong? Driver taught that the second interpretation gives the higher and fuller meaning to the term, and forms also a more adequate basis for the practical duty inculcated in [...] for a God, who was not unique might not necessarily be a worthy object of human love. Driver taught that the first interpretation, however, is not excluded by the second, for the unity of God is almost a necessary corollary of God's Uniqueness. Driver concluded that [...] is thus a great declaration of Monotheism in the sense both {{that there is only}} one God, and also that the God who exists is truly One. Driver taught that the truth is one which in its full significance was only gradually brought home to the Israelites and was hardly explicitly enunciated much before the age of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah. Driver read verses like [...] ( [...] in the KJV), and [...] to imply that God is superior to [...] "other gods" [...] or that [...] "other gods" [...] cannot be compared to God, but not to deny the real existence of [...] "other gods." [...] Driver argued that it was only gradually seen distinctly, and taught explicitly, not only that God is unique among [...] "other gods," [...] but that [...] "other gods" [...] have no real existence whatever beside God.|$|E
