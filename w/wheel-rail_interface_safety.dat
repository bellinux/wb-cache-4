40|$|With {{a view to}} {{examining}} the dynamic responses of the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface,</b> a three-dimensional wagontrack system dynamics (3 D WTSD) model was developed and presented widely in the literature by the authors in recent times. The 3 D WTSD model consists of three subsystems, namely, a 37 degree-of freedom (DOF) wagon subsystem, a <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> subsystem and a four-layer track subsystem. This paper presents {{the application of the}} 3 D WTSD model to the examination of the effect of track geometry irregularities on the lateral and vertical dynamic impact forces. The simulated dynamic responses at the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> due to some geometric irregularities, namely, the ariation of cross level and gauge are presented. The characteristics of the dynamic responses due to these track irregularities are examined. The sensitivity of the dynamic responses to the variation of cross level and gauge are also presented. It is shown that when the wavelength of cross level irregularity was less 2 m, the vertical impact force exhibited higher rates of increase. It is also shown that the derivation of the gauge face of the rail in the plane of track has pronounced effect on the (L/V) ratio...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} design of a new wheel profile which {{can be used in a}} {{tram-train}} vehicle. A tram-train is a dual-mode vehicle that operates on two very different railway infrastructures: as a tram on light rail infrastructure and as a conventional train on heavy rail infrastructure. The challenges of <b>wheel–rail</b> <b>interface</b> have been highlighted and discussed, and the analysis and design process required to develop an optimised wheel profile for dual-operation running have been presented. One of the key issues in developing a dual-operation wheel profile was managing the contact conditions within the <b>wheel–rail</b> <b>interface.</b> The interface is critical not only to the safe running of the vehicle but also to maximise asset life and to minimise wheel–rail damage. A combination of vehicle dynamic simulations and bespoke software was used to allow the development of a new wheel profile for tram-train operations...|$|R
50|$|Just {{as in the}} {{prototype}} railway, on a model the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> is the fundamental aspect of reliable operation. So {{as well as a}} track gauge, P4 also specifies the wheel profile and track parameters to use, which are largely a scaled-down version of real-life standards with some allowances for practical manufacturing tolerances.|$|R
40|$|Bogie {{architecture}} (solid axles or independently rotating wheels, monobloc or resilient wheels) has {{a fundamental}} {{impact on the}} contact forces exchanged at <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface,</b> especially when considering small radius curves, which are typical of urban tramways.

40|$|A {{handbook}} on Best Practice in the Management of the <b>Wheel-Rail</b> <b>Interface</b> on Mixed Traffic Railways. Britain’s Vehicle/Track Systems Interface Committee {{commissioned the}} best practice hand-book {{as a means}} of disseminating under-standing, knowledge and know-how on good practice in managing the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface.</b> This interface is critical in the safe and efficient operation of railways of all types since it experiences high loads in demanding environmental conditions. The information to be presented has been accumulated by practitioners and academics through theoretical and applied studies, in railway research centres, university laboratories and at the trackside. In particular, the book will contain the results of the research undertaken between 2000 and 2009, {{as a result of the}} realisation that the last years of the 20 th century saw great changes in terms of both the technology used by the railways and the management of operations. The handbook will support the development of cost-effective methods for managing the lifecycle of both the wheel and the rail and for minimising the risk of future failures. The editorial team is being supported in its efforts by Network Rail and its partners in Britain’s railway industry<br/...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of railways, single {{vehicles}} or groups were propelled by human power, or by horses. As mechanical power came to be understood, locomotive engines were developed; the iron horse. These had serious limitations, in particular being much heavier than the wagons in use, they broke the rails; and adhesion at the iron-to-iron <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> was a limitation, for example in trials on the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway.|$|R
50|$|Next, the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> was {{attended}} to. Axle bearings were unmodified items, broken in for 10,000 km in revenue {{service on the}} LGV Sud-Est. Yaw dampers were stiffened, and doubled up on each side {{for a total of}} four yaw dampers on each truck, for redundancy in case of a high-speed failure. As a result of earlier testing and computer simulations, transverse dampers were stiffened on the power trucks.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{significance of}} vehicle dynamics on the dynamic component of <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> vertical forces caused by relatively short wavelength track perturbations is estimated, {{based on a}} simple dynamic model, {{for a range of}} suspension design types. The results indicate the relative importance of suspension design on track damage. This study is analytical. However, it provides a basis for testing to ensure that the influence of suspension design on track-induced vertical loads is better documented and understood...|$|R
30|$|The continual {{increase}} in wagon axle load, train length and speed in worldwide heavy haul railways has increased pressure on railway track operators {{to improve the}} capacity of their track system. Track damage and wheel and rail defects appear more often than ever before. Short-wavelength wheel and rail defects such as wheel flats, squats on the rail top surface, rail welds with poor finishing quality, insulated rail joints, rail corrugations cause large dynamic contact forces at the <b>wheel–rail</b> <b>interface,</b> leading to fast deterioration of the track.|$|R
40|$|A floating-slab {{track with}} {{discontinuous}} slab provides a spatially-varying stiffness under a constant moving load. When a train moves {{on such a}} track, even with the absence of rail roughness, a parametric excitation develops as wheels {{move up and down}} applying dynamic forces at the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface.</b> The dynamic force is magnified if one of its principal frequencies matches with any of the train or the track resonance frequencies. In this paper, a new method based on a Fourier series representation is developed to couple a moving train to a track with discontinuous slab. A two-degree-of-freedom system is used to model a quarter of a train with four axles and two bogies moving on a track with constant velocity. The purpose of this work is to investigate the dynamic effect of slab discontinuity on trains running in underground railway tunnels, where the velocity is less than 100 km/hr. For typical parameters of a train and a track, it is found that the force at the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> is only increased by 1 % of its static value due to slab discontinuity. However, the dynamic effect may be more important in circumstances where high-speed or heavy-axled trains are used in underground tunnels. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Elastic "shock" waves {{emanating from}} the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> of a train running at a speed close {{to one of the}} {{propagation}} velocities of the soil may cause great amounts of nuisances to the population. An integrated rigid body - FEM model has been created in order to advance the understanding of these effects and predict the effects of different countermeasures. Usage of a fixed mesh includes more elements than necessary for an accurate solution and limits the analysis to a rather short distance. This paper replaces a large fixed mesh with a smaller mobile grid. A special algorithm has been developed to ensure that the nodes are translated with the same speed as the passing vehicle. The values of fields are updated through an interpolation procedure. Results indicate that a size of about 15 m in front of and behind the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interfaces</b> is enough to ensure the same results as the fixed mesh in a fraction of the time. The initial transient phase is followed by a relatively constant wave pattern being transported underneath the train. Waves are shown to be greatly magnified if the speed of the system exceeds the Rayleigh velocity of the top layer of crust. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{the application of}} various techniques to improve {{the management of the}} <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> for light rail systems. The authors show how simulation tools, measurement and data analytics can be applied to give significant improvements in asset management. The authors experience ranges from legacy lightrail, through new build to modern metro systems enabling them to provide practical examples of the range of techniques discussed. Previous work, conducted on-behalf of ORR, UKTram and EU research projects, has demonstrated the variation in wheel-rail profiles, rail steel grades and maintenance limits (e. g. wheel-rail wear) adopted by UK and International light-rail systems. Optimising the selection of these parameters can provide significant benefits and costs for light-rail systems through; (a) maximising the life of the rail and reduction in premature rail replacement, (b) improved planning of maintenance and renewals, (c) reduction in carbon footprint and (d) reduction in disruption to passenger service. Results from current UKTram ‘low impact light-rail’ project will be summarised along with observations from the completed EU research project PM’n’IDEA. This will include examples of how effective management of the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> and the use of simulation tools can lead to optimal selection rail wear limits and rail steel grade...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} project {{was conducted at}} Queensland University of Technology {{on the relationship between}} the forces at the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> in track and the rate of degradation of track. Data for the study was obtained from an instrumented vehicle which ran repeatedly over a section of Queensland Rail's track in Central Queensland over a 6 -month period. The wheel-rail forces had to be correlated with the elements of roughness in the test track profile, which were measured with a variety of equipment. At low frequencies, there was strong correlation between forces and profile, as expected, but diminishing correlation as frequencies increased...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wheel–rail</b> <b>interface</b> is {{fundamental}} for the comfort {{and the safety}} of the train. For this reason the wheel and the rail surface condition are checked with periodic non-destructive controls. The presence of a crack can be tolerated if we are able to predict its evolution by using fracture mechanics concepts. The problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} surface cracks propagate in mixed mode conditions. In this paper a photoelastic technique is presented to experimentally determine the stress intensity factors in a model of cracked rail under contact loads. The first results are critically discussed...|$|R

40|$|Methods for multibody {{modelling}} and simulation should accurately {{replicate the}} dynamic behaviour of rail-wheel interface including precise values for wheel-rail contact positions. This paper studies {{the development of}} a novel 3 -D wheel-rail contact model which is used for dynamic simulation of a suspended wheelset with parameters listed for a typical Mark IV coach. The contact point locations on the wheel and rail are determined by the minimum difference method considering the lateral displacement, yaw angle and the roll angle. The proposed new 3 D wheel-rail contact model can be applied in railway condition monitoring techniques to estimate the wheel geometry parameters and thus to achieve practical optimised <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interfaces...</b>|$|R

The research focuses on the geometric combination of both wheel and rail profiles to establish how the contact interface may be optimised to increase the adhesion level, but also to investigate how {{the change in the}} property of the contact mechanics at the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> may also lead to changes in the vehicle dynamic behavior...|$|R

The importance of input data such as wheel and rail profiles and track geometry is explained and examples of typical outputs and how these can be used to provide guidance on safety and maintenance presented. Finally, advice is given for the use of simulation of vehicle dynamics to ensure best practice in the management of the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> for light rail systems...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> (also {{known as}} wheel-rail {{interaction}}) is the on-contact interaction between wheels and rails in railways. The term {{is used in}} connection with the design and management of their interaction. The focus is on safety improvement, maintenance and replacement costs reduction, downtime reduction, and energy and environmental management.The part of the Rail wheel that rests on the rail is known as the tread. The tread is held in place by a flange. Rail wheels can have either a single flange that rests only {{on one side of the}} rail or two flanges with one flange resting on each side of the rail.|$|R
40|$|To {{properly}} {{simulate the}} propagation of an existing crack, we need to model how fast and in what direction it grows. A Generalized Crack Driving Force (GCDF), based {{on the concept of}} material forces cf. [1], is used to formulate a framework for crack propagation models. This framework can be used to formulate different crack propagation strategies: Explicit Proportional Extension (EPE), Implicit Proportional Extension (IPE) and Maximum Parallel Release Rate (MPRR), cf. [2]. Here, it is shown that all three strategies produce quantitatively good results compared with experiments, for the case of a three point bending test with an eccentric edge crack and internal holes [3]. In railway applications, highly complex loading cases arise in the <b>wheel–rail</b> <b>interface,</b> due to a moving contact load. For this particular loading case it is observed that the perpendicular component of the GCDF is highly dependent on the chosen parameters of the numerical algorithm. Hence, it is concluded that only the MPRR method remains applicable as it is only dependent on the parallel component of the GCDF and therefore more robust. Furthermore, the high loads in the <b>wheel-rail</b> <b>interface</b> result in large plastic deformation whereby the fracture resistance of the material becomes anisotropic [4]. Based on the MPRR method, {{the propagation of}} a single head check crack in a piece of rail, under realistic Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) loading conditions, is simulated by the use of a 2 D FE model incorporating elastoplastic material behaviour. Finally, results from the simulations are presented and qualitatively compared to field observations...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} is proposed {{in this paper}} to deal with non-Hertzian normal contact in <b>wheel–rail</b> <b>interface,</b> extending the widely used Kik–Piotrowski method. The new {{approach is}} able to consider {{the effect of the}} yaw angle of the wheelset against the rail on the shape of the contact patch and on pressure distribution. Furthermore, the method considers the variation of profile curvature across the contact patch, enhancing the correspondence to CONTACT for highly non-Hertzian contact conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed method can provide more accurate estimation than the original algorithm compared to Kalker’s CONTACT, and that the influence of yaw on the contact results is significant under certain circumstances...|$|R

The dynamic ride forces are obtained from numerical simulations, developed {{on the basis of}} a ‘rigid body’ type vehicle with 10 degrees of freedom, where the inputs are represented by the track irregularities, analytically introduced. The results here featured make a point from the influence of velocity and the amplitude of the track geometric irregularities upon the value of the dynamic ride forces, depending on the axle position within the running gear. ...|$|R

For this purpose conformal contact analyses are carried out by means of Finite Element (FE) models, and also with the exact rolling contact theory approach developed by Kalker, which has been appropriately adapted by the authors {{in order to take}} into account some of the effects of conformity. On the other hand, equivalent cases are analysed without taking into account the effects of conformity. In this way, the validity of the hypothesis of non-conformity is evaluated in different cases with varying degrees of conformity...|$|R
