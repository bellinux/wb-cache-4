25|$|However, {{the sector}} still faces major challenges. The {{quality of the}} {{services}} is poor, as evidenced by intermittent water supply in urban areas and limited wastewater treatment. Poor drinking water quality and sanitation lead to major outbreaks of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> major outbreaks of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> swept the cities of Faisalabad, Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar in 2006. Estimates indicate that each year, {{more than three million}} Pakistanis become infected with <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> In addition, many service providers do not even cover the costs of operation and maintenance due to low tariffs and poor efficiency. Consequently, the service providers strongly depend on government subsidies and external funding. A National Sanitation Policy and a National Drinking Water Policy have been approved in 2006 and 2009 respectively with the objective to improve water and sanitation coverage and quality. However, the level of annual investment (US$4/capita) still remains much below what would be necessary to achieve a significant increase in access and service quality.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{diseases}} are grouped {{together under the}} name of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases,</b> which are diseases transmitted via fecal pathogens in water.

40|$|<b>Waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> {{remains a}} major public health problem in many countries. We report {{findings}} on nearly three decades of <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> in Israel and the part these diseases play in the total national burden of enteric disease. During the 1970 s and 1980 s, Israel?s community water supplies were frequently of poor quality according to the microbiological standards at that time, and the country experienced many outbreaks of <b>waterborne</b> enteric <b>disease.</b> New regulations raised water quality standards and made chlorination of community water supplies mandatory, as well as imposing more stringent guidelines on maintaining water sources and distribution systems for both surface water and groundwater. This was followed by improved compliance and water quality, and a marked {{decline in the number}} of outbreaks of waterborne disease; no outbreaks were detected between 1992 and 1997. The incidence of waterborne salmonellosis, shigellosis, and typhoid declined markedly as proportions of the total burden of these diseases, but peaked during the time in which there were frequent outbreaks of <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> (1980 - 85). Long-term trends in the total incidence of reported infectious enteric diseases from all sources, including typhoid, shigellosis, and viral hepatitis (all types) declined, while the total incidence of salmonellosis increased. Mandatory chlorination has had an important impact on improving water quality, in reducing outbreaks of <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> in Israel, and reducing the total burden of enteric disease in the country...|$|R
25|$|Initially {{these systems}} {{discharged}} sewage directly to surface waters without treatment. Later, cities attempted {{to treat the}} sewage before discharge {{in order to prevent}} water pollution and <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> During the half-century around 1900, these public health interventions succeeded in drastically reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases among the urban population, and were an important cause in the increases of life expectancy experienced at the time.|$|E
25|$|Forced marches {{often made}} troops do without {{supplies}} as the supply wagons {{struggled to keep}} up. Lack {{of food and water}} in thinly populated, much less agriculturally dense regions led to the death of troops and their mounts by exposing them to <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> from drinking from mud puddles and eating rotten food and forage.

25|$|Many of the {{chemical}} substances are toxic. Pathogens can produce <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> in either human or animal hosts. Alteration of water's physical chemistry includes acidity (change in pH), electrical conductivity, temperature, and eutrophication. Eutrophication {{is an increase in}} the concentration of chemical nutrients in an ecosystem to an extent that increases the primary productivity of the ecosystem. Depending on the degree of eutrophication, subsequent negative environmental effects such as anoxia (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur, affecting fish and other animal populations.|$|E
25|$|The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) {{from the}} World Water Assessment Program {{indicates}} that, {{in the next}} 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought.

40|$|Summary: Since 1971, the CDC, EPA, and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) have {{maintained}} the collaborative national <b>Waterborne</b> <b>Disease</b> and Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) to document <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks (WBDOs) reported by local, state, and territorial health departments. WBDOs were recently reclassified to better characterize water system deficiencies and risk factors; {{data were analyzed}} for trends in outbreak occurrence, etiologies, and deficiencies during 1971 to 2006. A total of 833 WBDOs, 577, 991 cases of illness, and 106 deaths were reported during 1971 to 2006. Trends of public health significance include (i) {{a decrease in the}} number of reported outbreaks over time and in the annual proportion of outbreaks reported in public water systems, (ii) an increase in the annual proportion of outbreaks reported in individual water systems and in the proportion of outbreaks associated with premise plumbing deficiencies in public water systems, (iii) no change in the annual proportion of outbreaks associated with distribution system deficiencies or the use of untreated and improperly treated groundwater in public water systems, and (iv) the increasing importance of Legionella since its inclusion in WBDOSS in 2001. Data from WBDOSS have helped inform public health and regulatory responses. Additional resources for <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> surveillance and outbreak detection are essential to improve our ability to monitor, detect, and prevent <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> in the United States...|$|R
25|$|Typically in {{developed}} countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though {{only a small}} proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. Other typical uses include washing, toilets, and irrigation. Greywater may {{also be used for}} toilets or irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with risks. Water may also be unacceptable due to levels of toxins or suspended solids. Reduction of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> and development of safe water resources is a major public health goal in developing countries. Bottled water is sold for public consumption {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The {{first modern}} piped water system in Japan was {{completed}} in 1887 in the port city Yokohama, using surface water treated by a sand filter. By 1900, seven cities had piped water supply and by 1940 about {{one third of the}} population was connected to piped water systems. The incidence of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid remained high until after the Second World War when disinfection was introduced by the Americans and became mandatory in 1957. Through the increase of piped water supply, disinfection and sanitation the incidence of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> dropped sharply during the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
25|$|Early {{techniques}} involved {{land application}} of sewage on agricultural land. The {{use of the}} land treatment systems continued into the nineteenth/twentieth century in central Europe, USA, and other locations all over the world, but not without causing serious public health concerns and negative environmental impacts. During 1840s and 1850s, this practice resulted in disastrous spread of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> like cholera and typhoid. However, when the water supply links with these diseases became clear, engineering solutions were implemented that include the development of alternative water sources using reservoirs and aqueduct systems, relocation of water intakes, and water and wastewater treatment systems.|$|E
