40|$|This paper {{describes}} an operations research procedure {{based on the}} theory of graphs. It serves to determine optimal locations for the facilities of a regional system of solid-waste and <b>wastewater</b> <b>disposals,</b> with consideration of transportation costs, processing costs, and pollution standards. In the literature, planning problems of this kind are solved by means of combined, binary, linear optimization algorithms. The procedure presented here {{is based on a}} branch-and-bound method and a flow-graph algorithm. Within this approach it is possible to integrate explicitly equipment such as incinerators, or composting plants, or sewage treatment plants, where quantity reducing processes occur. ...|$|R
2500|$|In cold climates {{frozen ground}} can make digging difficult. It's often {{necessary}} to use local materials, if suitable, for construction. Engineers must provide roadways, landing zones, shelter, {{water supply and}} <b>wastewater</b> <b>disposal,</b> and electrical power to encampments. Roadway and landing zones require heavy equipment, which is more fatiguing {{to operate in the}} cold and necessary to protect from freezing. Snowstorms require cleanup and spring thaw requires management of thawed soil. Landing zones require stabilization of dust and snow to avoid blinding helicopter pilots. The US Army has cold-weather adaptive kits for providing water and electrical utilities. The tactical engineer has limited options for providing a water supply; they are in order of ease of provision: [...] drawing water from rivers or lakes, melting ice or snow, or drilling wells.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, oil {{was found}} at the Ellwood Oil Field {{on the other side}} of Santa Barbara, and {{development}} of this new and rich pool was fast: the peak production in 1930, only two years later, was [...] of oil. As at the Summerland Oil Field, derricks went along piers into the ocean, and the cliffs were dotted with storage tanks. Some of this development remains to the present day, with one active <b>wastewater</b> <b>disposal</b> well and several large storage tanks, owned by Venoco, Inc., adjacent to the Ellwood Open Space. [...] In 1929, as part of the wild burst of oil-drilling activity following on the Ellwood discovery, the Mesa Oil Field was discovered within the city limits. Centered just south of Cliff Drive near the intersection with Santa Cruz Boulevard, the field sprouted over 100 oil derricks in the early 1930s, occasioning the city's first anti-oil protest, but a local ordinance had already been enacted allowing such development. The field’s failure in the late 1930s—it proved to be smaller than initially thought—allowed residential development to continue on the Mesa, although the field was not formally abandoned until 1976.|$|E

The untreated wastewater from industries, such as dyes, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, antiseptic agents, medicines for pharmaceutical and poultry synthesis, gums, distillery, dye intermediates and printing, is the major contributors that cause damage to the water quality. The untreated <b>wastewater</b> <b>disposals</b> from these industries {{affect the quality of}} water and may have health issues such as blood, enzyme and nerve damage with cyanosis and the danger of suffocation.

The septic drain field is effective for disposal of organic materials readily catabolized by a microbial ecosystem.
