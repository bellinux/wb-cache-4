[...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream".

Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> where they are in life.

500|$|William Luis {{argues that}} How the García Girls Lost Their Accents [...] "is {{an attempt to}} {{understand}} memory, the past and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents". Memory {{plays a significant role}} in the text, as a means by which the girls can return to the past of their childhood in the attempt to make sense of their present-day realities. The youngest child, Sofía carries with her only a single memory of her brief childhood on the island, in which the García's Haitian maid, Chucha, says a voodoo goodbye to the girls before they leave for the United States. Sofía feels segregated and deprived [...] "because she has only this one memory to help her reconstruct her bicultural, bilingual self. Though this lack of memory makes her the least divided of her sisters in many ways... the most disturbed, the most rebellious against her circumstances." [...] Ironically enough, Chucha’s voodoo prediction itself is largely concerned with the concept of memory, as she insists that after leaving the island the girls [...] "will be haunted by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> don't remember. But they have spirit in them. They will invent what they need to survive". Julie Barak confirms this notion of memory as both a positive and negative force in the García girls’ constant struggle to unearth their true identities.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the singer}} {{was interviewed by}} Nobel Literature Prize-winning Colombian novelist and {{journalist}} Gabriel García Márquez, who was [...] "astonished by her fantastical work-rate" [...] and said that [...] "Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look like anyone else's {{and no one can}} sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention." [...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as she opens her mouth, she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> of course in music, undoubtedly." [...] Shakira's crossover success also inspired other Latin artists to foray into the English language market and many compared Mexican singer Paulina Rubio's attempt to crossover with her English-language debut album Border Girl to that by Shakira.|$|E

2500|$|Achievement {{motivation}} was studied intensively by David C. McClelland, John W. Atkinson {{and their colleagues}} since the early 1950s.

In achievement motivation, one would hope that they excel in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> not think much about the failures or the negatives. [...] Their research showed that business managers who were successful demonstrated a high need to achieve no matter the culture.

2500|$|Genetics is {{the study}} of genes—what they are, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> how they work. [...] Genes inside the nucleus of a cell are strung {{together}} {{in such a way that}} the sequence carries information: that information determines how living organisms inherit various features (phenotypic traits). For example, offspring produced by sexual reproduction usually look similar to each of their parents because they have inherited some of each of their parents' genes. Genetics identifies which features are inherited, and explains how these features pass from generation to generation. In addition to inheritance, genetics studies how genes are turned on and off to control what substances are made in a cell—gene expression; and how a cell divides—mitosis or meiosis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the public view archaeology as being something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a [...] "romantic adventurist occupation". To generalize, the public views archaeology as a fantasized hobby more than {{a job in the}} scientific community. The audience may not take away scientific methods from popular cinema but they do form a notion of [...] "who archaeologists are, why they do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> how relationships to the past are constituted". The modern depiction of archaeology is sensationalized so much that it has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is. The public is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts.|$|E

When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said."
