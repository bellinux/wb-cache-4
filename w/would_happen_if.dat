5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> Nhu {{responded to the}} cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
5|$|While {{national}} security concerns were {{cited as the}} grounds for rejection, politics {{played an important role}} as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> SNECMA pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be {{the beginning of the end}} of American aerospace leadership.|$|E

25|$|The Kaldor–Hicks {{methods are}} {{typically}} used as tests of potential improvements {{rather than as}} efficiency goals themselves. They are used to determine whether an activity moves the economy toward Pareto efficiency. Any change usually makes some people better off and others worse off, so these tests consider what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> gainers were to compensate losers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Lawrence grabbed {{attention}} from the television movie The Day After. The TV movie first appeared on ABC but was later shown in movie theaters around the world.

The movie was filmed in Lawrence, and hundreds of local residents appeared in the film as extras and in speaking roles.|$|E

25|$|The {{ideas for}} Flowers for Algernon {{developed}} over 14years and {{were inspired by}} events in Keyes's life, starting in 1945 with Keyes's conflict with his parents who were pushing him through a pre-medical education despite his desire to pursue a writing career. Keyes felt that his education was driving a wedge {{between him and his}} parents, and this led him to wonder what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> it were possible to increase a person's intelligence.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 2006 Shalit's captors made an {{ultimatum}} {{according to which}} they demanded that Israel must fulfill all of its demands by 4 July 2006 at 6:00am.

After the ultimatum period expired the Army of Islam group announced that no more information would be released about Shalit's fate.|$|E
25|$|The {{discrepancies}} {{in the various}} figures {{can be attributed to}} several factors: first of all, entire families were killed, and many of the survivors were subsequently scattered across the country. The absence of relatives made tallying the dead more difficult, as did the severe warnings the villagers received in the immediately ensuing years about what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> they discussed the massacre. The fact that many of the victims were burnt alive in a single, small enclosure complicated the identification of remains and, to date, it is not certain that all the clandestine graves in the vicinity of Plan de Sánchez have been found.|$|E
