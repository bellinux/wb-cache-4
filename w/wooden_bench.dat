25|$|The {{interior}} of the Church has an extensive range of early eighteenth century wooden fittings, which, because of the subsequent abandonment of the Church, has survived in a largely unaltered state where nineteenth century improvers would have swept them away. There is a large gallery at the west end, accessed by a stone spiral staircase. The gallery has <b>wooden</b> <b>bench</b> seating for a choir, and an enclosed area and a pyramidal music stand. The {{main body of the}} Church has box pews, some facing east, others, alongside the pulpit, face south toward the pulpit, indicating the liturgical emphasis toward the pulpit, where the sermons are delivered, rather than the altar, where the mass is celebrated. The pulpit itself is positioned part-way down the south wall, and is a wood-panelled triple combination of pulpit, reading desk and clerk's desk, which is re-worked from 17th century items.|$|E

500|$|An {{episode of}} MTV Unplugged {{starring}} Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; she performed an acoustic version of [...] "Drive", among several additional tracks from Bangerz. The entire episode followed a theme inspired by country music; during [...] "Drive" [...] in particular, Cyrus {{was dressed in}} a matching jean jacket, bra, and pants set. A close-up of her face was shown for much of the performance, although the camera occasionally panned across the stage and revealed that Cyrus was seated on a <b>wooden</b> <b>bench</b> through the full song. Cyrus has performed the track during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. The performance received positive reviews from critics. While performing [...] "Drive" [...] during the first leg of the tour, Cyrus wore a black, floor-length Marc Jacobs gown with subtle sequined lightning stripes down the skirt, sheer black quarter-length sleeves, and a ruffly mock turtleneck. During the second leg of the tour, Cyrus wore a jewel-encrusted black jumpsuit designed by Roberto Cavalli.|$|E
500|$|With rising {{crowds and}} the Football Association raising {{concerns}} over the suitability of The Nest, the club considered renovation, but ultimately decided on a move to Carrow Road. [...] The original stadium was terraced on three sides, with only one stand (along Carrow Road) having <b>wooden</b> <b>bench</b> seating and a roof. The inaugural match at the new ground, held on 31 August 1935, against West Ham United, ended in a 4–3 victory for the home team and set a new record attendance of 29,779. [...] A highlight of the fourth season at Carrow Road was the visit of King George VI on 29 October 1938; {{this was the first}} occasion a reigning monarch attended a second tier football match. [...] The club was relegated back to the Third Division {{at the end of the}} season. Norwich's anguish was exacerbated by the closeness of the relegation fight; having finished second from bottom of Division Two, they were demoted on a goal average difference of just 0.05.|$|E

[...] So the company president, Channing Meek, came up to the quarry, sat on the <b>wooden</b> <b>bench,</b> was lowered over the mountainside, and started cutting marble. [...] After that no worker refused to go over the side and cut marble. Quarry 2 was followed by #3 in 1907 and #1 in 1912. [...] A fourth opening to the left of #3 (out of view) was started but did not become a producing quarry.|$|E

2500|$|That same Wednesday 24 July 1974 at 3:30 pm, {{outside the}} Social Services office in Shaftesbury Square, Ogilby and her {{daughter}} were kidnapped by 25-year-old UDA man Albert [...] "Bumper" [...] Graham, while members of Elizabeth Douglas' [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] waited at the nearby Regency Hotel lounge bar overlooking the office. They knew beforehand that Ogilby had an appointment that afternoon at the Shaftesbury Square office. Using the pretext that a UDA commander wished to speak with her, Graham was able to abduct Ogilby {{and her daughter}} Sharlene {{as they left the}} office; Ogilby, taken in by Graham's words, willingly got into his blue minibus. [...] Having made a pre-arranged signal to the watching women, Graham drove the two females away to the UDA club in Hunter Street, Sandy Row, which had been turned into a [...] "romper room". When the UDA women, led by Douglas, arrived on the scene, Ogilby tried to escape, but was grabbed and forcibly detained. After Graham sent Sharlene to a corner shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was ordered by Douglas to be dragged inside the former bakery and forced upstairs to the first floor where she was made to sit on a <b>wooden</b> <b>bench,</b> blindfolded and a hood placed over her head. By this stage, Ogilby was so intimidated and terrorised by the [...] "Heavy Squad", she no longer put up any resistance. Sunday Life newspaper suggested that she was bound to a chair instead of a bench. Ciarán Barnes, a journalist writing for the paper, had conducted an interview with Sharlene Ogilby in 2010. Retired RUC detective, Alan Simpson, who devoted a chapter to the Ann Ogilby murder in his 1999 book Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles, instead affirmed that Ogilby was forced by her captors to sit on a <b>wooden</b> <b>bench.</b> Although hooded and blindfolded, her hands remained untied.|$|E
2500|$|Theru koothu is {{possibly}} the most popular entertainment forms in rural Tamil Nadu. It literally means [...] "street party".

A <b>wooden</b> <b>bench</b> is set up to seat the singers and the music troupe. Make-up and costumes are considered of prime importance. Traditionally, only men take part; the female roles are also played by them. The performance consists of story-telling, dialogue-rendering, singing and dancing, all performed by the artists having good performing skills. The stories are taken from Puranas (ancient texts), epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharata, and also local folklore. The play starts late in the evening and goes on until late in the night.|$|E
