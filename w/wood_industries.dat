40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the {{reduction}} in the number and size structure of large enterprises in the <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> on the dynamics of the shadow economy in the <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> in Slovenia. The empirical results show that the dynamics in the reduction of the number and size structure of large enterprises in the <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> significantly contributes on the increasing share of the shadow economy in the <b>wood</b> <b>industry.</b> The most important decision factors to participate in the shadow economy are the level of taxes and contributions, opportunities for better earnings and tax regulations. The estimated share of the shadow economy in the <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> is 21. 7 %. As the basic solutions to reduce the share of the shadow economy and to speed up the dynamics of the entering of small enterprises in the <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> are improved regulation system to provide better incentives to operate within the formal sector and better access for necessary financial capital at acceptable guarantees. As important are also good practices by the state institutions by providing incentives for entrepreneurship and encouraging decisions for the setting up of an enterprise...|$|R

40|$|Conservation and {{environmental}} protection are among the major world challengesin the next decade. To achieve the objectives of environment-friendly economic development, dynamic, flexible and profitable companies are needed, willing to deal with ecological issues. Since the <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> contributes significantly to environmental pollution, {{it has become increasingly}} necessary to implement environment-friendly production, in addition to existing economic criteria. This is one of the very important strategic goals of the <b>wood</b> <b>industry.</b> There are problems however, since in ecological systems not only parameters defined by numerical variables are at play, but also subjective assessments and value judgments, which are difficultto define in absolute values. Finding optimal economic and ecologicalsolutions in the <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> is an even more complex and demandingprocess, because mutually conflicting goals are usually involved. In this paper a methodology is developed for diagnosing the existing ecological state in <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> systems, as well as finding the optimal solution with regard to their management, taking into consideration economic and ecological criteria. ...|$|R
