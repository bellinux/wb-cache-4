5|$|On 9 February {{he claimed}} a night victory—a Ju 88 which vanished. MacLachlan claimed it destroyed. The Malta Y Service was combing the air waves {{and picked up}} the German crew's desperate {{distress}} calls. The aircraft was actually a He 111 from 5./Kampfgeschwader 26 (KG 26—Bomber Wing 26). All the crew survived though one was wounded. Within half an hour he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> again. He engaged a Ju 88 from II./LG 1 and claimed it shot down. In fact the Ju 88 managed to reach Catania, Sicily where it was written off in a crash-landing.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{responded to}} these {{actions of the}} central {{government}} with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks, and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews. When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E

5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called for just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued {{to hold onto the}} idea of a march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The idea of a march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of the}} Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E

5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> These factors coupled with {{the social and political}} upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, an essential element of the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E

The missile had improvements over the previous version in terms of bigger warhead, improved maneuverability and reduced mis-distance. As the missile <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> one of the sub systems malfunctioned making it veer away from the flight path resulting in the failure of the mission.

Their first album, eponymously titled, was released on Columbia Records (likely stemming from Clive Davis's long-term aspiration to sign the Grateful Dead) in late 1971. It {{proved to be a}} moderate success comparable to the Dead's releases of the era, peaking at No. 39 on the Billboard 200 chart. Entirely composed by Dawson (in comparison to the more egalitarian songwriting of later releases), the record was driven by Garcia's pedal-steel playing.|$|E
25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{used the}} month-long pause in McClellan's advance to fortify the {{defenses}} of Richmond and extended the works {{south of the}} James River to a point below Petersburg; the total length of the new defensive line was about 30 miles (50km). To buy time to complete the new defensive line and prepare for an offensive, Lee repeated the tactic of making {{a small number of}} troops seem more numerous than they really were. Lee also sent Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry brigade completely around the Union army (June 13–15) in order to ascertain if the Union right flank <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> In addition, Lee ordered Jackson to bring his force to the Peninsula as reinforcements. Meanwhile, McClellan shifted most of his forces south of the Chickahominy, leaving only Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps north of the river.|$|E
