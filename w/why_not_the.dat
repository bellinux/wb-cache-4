500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it.

Look at the bailout of Wall Street. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> bailout of Main Street?

2500|$|As {{she came}} from a strong legal background, her family [...] "weren't wildly happy" [...] about her desire to become an actress: [...] "My parents were always making me watch Rumpole of the Bailey, going 'You see?

[...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way in}} my career since he died and I wish he was here to see it.

[...] The interviewer Clive Myrie then asked if a female Dalai Lama must be attractive, he followed up, [...] "I mean. If female Dalai Lama come, then that female must be attractive. Otherwise not much use." [...] Myrie replied [...] "You're joking, I'm assuming. Or you're not joking?" [...] to which The Dalai Lama insisted [...] "No. True!". The Dalai Lama then pointed to his own face, stating that to some people think he is very attractive and continued to laugh.|$|E
2500|$|The terms inoculation, {{vaccination}} and immunization {{are often}} used synonymously to refer to artificial induction of immunity against various infectious diseases. This is supported by some dictionaries. However, there are some important historical and current differences. In English medicine, inoculation referred only {{to the practice of}} variolation until the very early 1800s. When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798, this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation. Soon, to avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation continued to be referred to as variolation (from variola = smallpox) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination (from Jenner's use of variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow). Then, in 1891 Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine and vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed. Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin, which contains preformed antibody to e.g. diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins. Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection etc., and the question e.g. [...] "Have you had your flu injection/vaccination/inoculation/immunization?" [...] should not cause confusion. The focus is on what is being given and <b>why,</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> literal meaning of the technique used.|$|E

2500|$|On November 2, 2015, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub ruled Cosby and {{his former}} lawyer Martin Singer must give a {{deposition}} despite their efforts to have the case thrown out (Singer is not named as a defendant in the case). The ruling states Dickinson's lawyers can only seek answers {{as to whether the}} denials were made maliciously, and Cosby and Singer can assert attorney-client privilege and refuse to answer some questions. Singer was scheduled to be deposed November 19 in Los Angeles, with Cosby's deposition occurring on November 23 in Boston. On November 12, a California appeals court temporarily halted an order requiring them to testify. Both parties are required to provide information {{by the end of this}} month to state their cases as to why or <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> deposition should proceed. [...] "We are confident that once the Court of Appeals hears full argument on the issues it will allow the deposition of Mr. Cosby and his attorney to go forward," [...] Dickinson's attorney Lisa Bloom wrote in an email.
