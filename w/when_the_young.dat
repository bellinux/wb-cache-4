5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E

5|$|The first camp {{opened on}} May 15, 1941 near Baltimore, Maryland. A total of 152 camps and units were {{established}} {{over the next}} six years. The federal government provided work projects, housing, camp furnishings and paid for transportation to the camps.

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E

5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} is a {{predominantly}} seed and grain eating bird which feeds {{on the ground}} in flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as chickweeds and goosefoot, spilled grain, and it may also visit feeding stations, especially for peanuts. It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> are fed mainly on animal food; it takes insects, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was among}} the first novels he {{released}} under his own name, Balzac did not use characters in La Peau de chagrin from previous works. He did, however, introduce several individuals who resurfaced in later stories. Most significant of these is Eugène de Rastignac, the older gentleman who tutors Valentin in the vicious ways of high society. Thirty pages into the writing of his 1834 novel Le Père Goriot, Balzac suddenly crossed out the name he had been using for a character– Massiac– and used Rastignac instead. The relationship between teacher and student in La Peau de chagrin is mirrored in Le Père Goriot, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Rastignac is guided in the ways of social realpolitik by the incognito criminal Vautrin.|$|E
5|$|By 829, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> emperor Theophilos {{ascended the}} Byzantine throne, the Byzantines and Arabs had been {{fighting}} {{on and off for}} almost two centuries. At this time, Arab attacks resumed both in the east, where after almost twenty years of peace due to the Abbasid civil war Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) launched several large-scale raids, and in the west, where the gradual Muslim conquest of Sicily was under way since 827. Theophilos was an ambitious man and also a convinced adherent of Byzantine Iconoclasm, which prohibited the depiction of divine figures and the veneration of icons. He sought to bolster his regime and support his religious policies by military success against the Abbasid Caliphate, the Empire's major antagonist.|$|E

5|$|In 1672 Churchill {{was posted}} to sea again, and on 28 May {{fought against the}} Dutch navy in the Battle of Solebay (Southwold Bay), on the Suffolk coast. He was {{possibly}} aboard the Duke of York's flagship, the Prince, which was crippled in the action. Shortly thereafter, Churchill was promoted (above the resentful head of his lieutenant) to a captaincy in the Duke of York's Admiralty Regiment. The following year Churchill gained a commendation at the Siege of Maastricht <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> captain distinguished himself {{as part of the}} 30-man forlorn hope, successfully capturing and defending part of the fortress. During this incident Churchill is credited with saving the Duke of Monmouth's life, receiving a slight wound in the process but gaining further praise from a grateful House of Stuart, as well as recognition from the House of Bourbon. King LouisXIV in person commended the deed, from which time forward bore Churchill an enviable reputation for physical courage, as well as earning the high regard of the common soldier.|$|E
5|$|King Teuruarii IV {{was born}} Prince Epatiana in around 1879 {{on the island}} of Rurutu, in present-day French Polynesia, to King Teuruarii III and his second wife Taarouru a Mootua. His family was {{originally}} from a chiefly line in Huahine rather than Rurutu, and it was only through the adoption of his father by King Teuruarii I that his family was eligible to rule. The island of Rurutu was settled later than many of the surrounding islands and was historically ruled as an unoccupied territory by the earliest kings of the archipelago. Including these early kings, the royal line of Epatiana stretched back more than forty generations and included many of the founding chiefs of the Austral Islands kingdoms, as well as early kings of Rurutu after the settlement of the island. Little is recorded of the prince's childhood, although it is known that Epatiana and his parents were visited by the French writer and later governor of French Polynesia, Édouard Petit, in the early 1880s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> prince Epatiana was still nursing from his mother.|$|E
5|$|Lachanodrakon reappears in 790, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) {{conspired to}} {{overturn}} the tutelage of Irene. The general was sent by Constantine to the Armeniac Theme to secure the allegiance of its soldiers. Constantine succeeded in toppling his mother in December 790; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the supreme non-imperial title, that of magistros. According to the account of Theophanes, he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 {{that led to the}} disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July, where he was killed. The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of Versinikia, again against the Bulgars, in 813, but this is clearly an error.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell’s father (also named Colin) {{came from}} an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the MacBrayne ferry company before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I. Mitchell (Snr) {{achieved}} the rank of captain (commissioned ‘in the field’) and was awarded the Military Cross at the Second Battle of Ypres but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Colin {{asked him how he}} would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, he worked in the City of London and married a Glaswegian woman (née Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the LMS Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of Purley where they had two children – Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local Presbyterian Church wearing a kilt.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her {{there are no such}} thing as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Political forces {{beyond the}} borders of Egypt {{exacerbated}} the internal problems of the Ptolemaic kingdom. AntiochusIII the Great and PhilipV of Macedon had made a pact to divide Egypt's overseas possessions. Philip had seized several islands and cities in Caria and Thrace, while the Battle of Panium (198 BC) had resulted in the transfer of Coele-Syria, including Judaea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Meanwhile, in the south of Egypt, there was a long-standing revolt that had begun during the reign of PtolemyIV, led by Horwennefer and by his successor Ankhwennefer. Both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> PtolemyV was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign), and the Memphis decree issued.|$|E

5|$|The young Ueshiba {{was raised}} in a {{somewhat}} privileged setting. His father Yoroku was a wealthy gentleman farmer and minor politician, being an elected member of the Nishinotani village council for 22 consecutive years. His mother Yuki was from the Itokawa clan, a prominent local family who could trace their lineage back to the Heian period. Ueshiba was a rather weak, sickly child and bookish in his inclinations. At a young age his father encouraged him to take up sumo wrestling and swimming and entertained him with stories of his great-grandfather Kichiemon, who was considered a very strong samurai in his era. The need for such strength was further emphasized <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Ueshiba witnessed his father being attacked by followers of a competing politician.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
5|$|From 1907 to 1908, {{during the}} time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> Turks {{came to power in}} the Ottoman Empire, Armenians from the Caucasus, Western Armenia, and Iran started to {{collaborate}} with Iranian constitutionalists and revolutionaries. Political parties, notably the Dashnaktsutiun, wanted to influence the direction of the revolution towards greater democracy and to safeguard gains already achieved. The Dashnak contribution to the fight was mostly military, as it sent some of its well-known fedayees to Iran after the guerrilla campaign in the Ottoman Empire ended with the rise of the Young Turks. A notable ARF member already in Iran was Yeprem Khan, who had established a branch of the party in the country. Yeprem Khan was highly instrumental in the Constitutional revolution of Iran. After the Persian national parliament was shelled by the Russian Colonel Vladimir Liakhov, Yeprem Khan rallied with Sattar Khan and other revolutionary leaders in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran against Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar. Relations between Sattar Khan and the ARF oscillated between amity and resentment. Sometimes he was viewed as being ignorant, while at other times he was dubbed a great hero. Nonetheless, the ARF came to collaborate with him and alongside Yeprem Khan posted many victories including the capture of Rasht in February 1909. At the end of June 1909, the fighters arrived in Tehran and after several battles, took over the Majles building and the Sepahsalar mosque. Yeprem Khan was then appointed chief of Tehran police. This caused tensions between the Dashnaks and Khan.|$|E
