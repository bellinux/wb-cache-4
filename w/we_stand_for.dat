[...] Emphasising a campaign against capitalism and the oppression of the working classes, the group is also highly critical of British foreign policy, believing it to be imperialistic in nature. In particular, they criticise British control of Northern Ireland and the Malvinas Islands, the involvement of British troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the British government’s support for Israel.|$|E

On October 18, 2006, Arar and the Center for Constitutional Rights were honoured {{with the}} Institute for Policy Studies Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award, {{in recognition of}} the struggle to clear his name and draw attention to American abuses of human rights in dealing with terrorist suspects. Arar, along with Sergeant Patrick Tower, was chosen a co-Nation Builder by The Globe and Mail for 2006. [...] In April 2007, Time magazine named Arar to the TIME 100, its annual listing of 100 influential people in the world. [...] Arar's entry, at No. 58 in the Heroes & Pioneers category, was written by US Senator Patrick Leahy and says his case [...] "stands as a sad example of how we have been too willing to sacrifice our core principles to overarching government power in the name of security, when doing so only undermines the principles <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> and makes us less safe."

2500|$|The {{origins of}} many of the letters are obscure, though several appear to be acrophonic rebuses, with many of these being symbols from Africa. Examples of rebuses include a curl with a dot in it {{representing}} a baby in the belly (in Ndyuka, a abi beli, lit.

A [...] "+" [...] sign stands for , from the word name, derived from the practice of signing one's name with an X. The odd conflation of [...] and [...] is due to the letter being a pair of hooks, which is uku in Ndyuka. The only letters which appear to correspond to the Latin alphabet are the vowels a, o, and maybe e, though o is justified as the shape of the mouth when pronouncing it.|$|E

2500|$|During the Cold War, Sweden {{maintained}} a dual approach, publicly the strict neutrality policy was forcefully maintained, but unofficially strong ties were kept with the U.S. {{and it was}} hoped that the U.S. would use conventional and nuclear weapons to strike at Soviet staging areas in the occupied Baltic states in case of a Soviet attack on Sweden. Over time and due to the official neutrality dogma, fewer and fewer Swedish military officials were aware of the military cooperation with the west, making such cooperation in the event of war increasingly difficult. At the same time Swedish defensive planning was completely based on help from abroad in the event of war. The fact that it was not permissible to mention this aloud eventually led to the Swedish armed forces becoming highly misbalanced. For example, a strong ability to defend against an amphibious invasion was maintained, while an ability to strike at inland staging areas was almost completely absent. The political unity among the democratic parties on the neutrality politics where total which made it possible for Sweden to rearm the military. [...] In the 1970th and 1980th Sweden's military expenditure per capita where the highest in the world. Because of the neutrality politics most of the military equipment where produced and developed in Sweden by companies such as SAAB, Kockums, Bofors and Hägglunds (today BAE Systems AB). [...] Prime minister Olof Palme summarized the Swedish neutrality in a speech in 1985; Vi står för Sveriges oberoende i fred och kommer med fasthet att värna vårt territorium mot varje inkräktare (en: <b>We</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> Sweden's independence in peacetime and will, with firmness, defend our territory against every foreign intruder).|$|E

On the whole the record of British rule is a pretty respectable one; I am not ashamed of our record. Nevertheless the case is altering.|$|E
