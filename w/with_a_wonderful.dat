When he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, however, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings ("I'm in Love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Guy").|$|E

25|$|Weekes had {{a classic}} batting style, possessed {{a variety of}} shots {{on both sides of}} the wicket, and is {{considered}} one of the hardest hitters in cricket history. Described by The Times as lightly bow-legged, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> eye, wrists the envy of any batsman, and feet always the right place to play a shot, Richie Benaud stated that many Australians who saw Weekes in action said he was the closest batsman in style to the pre-World War II Donald Bradman. He was also compared to Bradman in his ability to keep the scoreboard moving and at using his feet to come down the pitch to slower bowlers. Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled Aspects of Fielding.|$|E

500|$|In other words, Bellman was a [...] "tavern rhymester", admittedly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> gift of improvisation, who wildly {{ignored the}} rules of {{literary}} genres. For example, within the classical tradition odes and satires {{were supposed to have}} different metres and different use of language. Kellgren did not mind the amoral attitude: [...] "indeed he shared it". But an Epistle like No. 28 traversed all moods, [...] "from lyrical to humorous, tragic, descriptive and dramatic." [...] It was too much for critics such as Kellgren.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production enjoyed immense {{critical and}} box-office success, became the second-longest running Broadway musical {{to that point}} (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier Oklahoma! (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind. [...] The piece won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950. [...] Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including [...] "Bali Ha'i", [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair", [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", [...] "Happy Talk", [...] "Younger Than Springtime", and [...] "I'm in Love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Guy", have become popular standards.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Downing's {{name was}} {{put forward by}} Hawke's Bay {{to play for the}} North Island in the annual Inter-Island match and he made selection. The North beat the South 12–8 in a closely contested, entertaining game in front of a full capacity crowd. The Northern forwards in general played a good game; it was suggested that Downing's passing back from the lineout to the halfback was something that other forwards might consider imitating. A tour with the North Island Country team followed, in which Downing played all four games. The last, against South Island Country in Wellington on 4 August, had to be stopped at half time due to the condition of the match ground, and the North won 14–3. His Hawke's Bay and North Island Country team-mate Norman McKenzie described him as [...] "an outstanding line-out forward <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> pair of hands".|$|E
500|$|Martin {{influenced}} {{several of}} her songs. [...] While showering one day during rehearsals, {{she came up with}} the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage. [...] This gave rise to [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair". Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in South Pacific. To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played [...] "I'm in Love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Guy" [...] for her. [...] When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. [...] Rodgers gazed down at her, [...] "That's exactly what I want. [...] Never do it differently. [...] We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound." ...|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the sets}} were chosen {{because of their}} {{proximity}} to large trees. Lisa's house, for instance, was built next to a large willow. An additional tree limb {{that was more than}} twenty feet long was attached to the real tree to give it a more menacing feel. The tree limb that attacked Mulder's car was a branch of a massive tree that had fallen on a nearby plot of public land. The producers secured permission from the Canadian government and hoisted the tree with a crane and then dropped it onto a former police cruiser. Nigel Habgood, the series car coordinator, was able to refurbish the cruiser and it was later used in the episode [...] "Kill Switch." [...] Mark Snow, composer for the series, was particularly proud of the music he wrote for the episode, noting that the story was a [...] "dark tale <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> aura about it." [...] He credits this ominous feel to woodwind instruments.|$|E
500|$|Hooper {{made his}} debut as {{a feature film}} {{director}} with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission drama Red Dust (2004), which stars Hilary Swank, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jamie Bartlett. The film was not widely seen, which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the Iraq War: [...] "When I started making it you could watch the movie <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> sense of 'we'd never do it in our own country…they're the horrible people but it's not us.' By the time the film came out (there were) these revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing. The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences {{it was designed to}} target. I have learned that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led." [...] The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on BBC Two in 2005, making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Two songs, [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun" [...] are {{intended}} to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s. [...] In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a big band arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of swing. [...] The sections beginning [...] "If the man don't understand you" [...] and [...] "If you laugh at different comics" [...] have a blues style. [...] Lovensheimer deems the song [...] "Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song". Mordden suggests that [...] "I'm in Love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Guy" [...] with its [...] "take no prisoners bounce", might well {{be the center of}} the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clichés, many of which, such as [...] "corny as Kansas in August" [...] Hammerstein made up, and [...] "sure enough, over the years they have become clichés".|$|E

500|$|Rehearsals {{began at}} Broadway's Belasco Theatre on February 2, 1949. [...] There was no formal chorus; {{each of the}} nurses and Seabees was given a name, and, {{in the case of}} the men, $50 to equip {{themselves}} with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. Don Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. [...] Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. [...] Of the mood backstage, [...] "everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive." [...] He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in Allegro), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. [...] He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude [...] "I'm in Love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Guy" [...] with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage. [...] This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.|$|E

2500|$|Mary Beale's {{paintings}} are {{often described as}} [...] "vigorous" [...] and [...] "masculine". (It was common to praise a woman for her work by calling her [...] "masculine".)
