500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television sources and critics. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, calling it [...] "without a doubt, the most [...] episode I've seen in quite some time" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "if Family Guy <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> show itself the butt of every joke, it needs to ramp up the conflict and tone down on the flights of fancy–most of those are funny for a bit, but excess can ruin just about anything." [...] Another complaint of the episode were the Back to the Future references and the storyline.|$|E
500|$|The game {{features}} over 80 unique {{characters in}} addition to the main protagonist, Eddie Riggs. Initial designs for Riggs was modeled after Lemmy Kilmister, and though the model was changed, the signature vest, tour pass and cigarette of the character remained part of the character design. As the character continued to develop, they began to add more aspects of Black's character, an [...] "enthusiastic fan" [...] of music, from School of Rock. Ultimately, Riggs' design came to become half Jack Black and half Glenn Danzig. The art team was able to use videos of Black's performances to add additional features to the character, such as [...] "all his crazy eyebrow stuff he does". General Lionwhyte, who has [...] "fabulous hair", and his minions are based on the glam metal fad of the 1980s which displaced heavy metal to the disappointment of Schafer and other development team members, and became the opponents of the game. To help create a more mature game with concepts {{that could be used to}} pitch the game, the art team created several factions that represented different parts of the heavy metal experience. Each faction had their own [...] "exaggerated, simplified shapes and strong silhouettes" [...] as to help distinguish each faction while also reducing the development costs. Inspirations for such factions include Nordic imagery, goth metal, and the artwork of Hieronymus Bosch. Additional characters include headbangers, [...] "gravediggers", and [...] "battle nuns". As the game features over two hours of spoken dialog, the art team <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> characters' faces and performances stand out, creating [...] "clean, easy-to-read faces". The team had to change from their initial cartoony textures into more detailed ones that stood out on high-definition displays while exaggerating other features of the characters.|$|E

At any rate, the embankment was on the beach, and the waves lapped the foot of it, and there was a wall of cut rock to landward. Then we disturbed many villages of fishermen, whose verandahs gave on to the track, and whose nets lay almost under our wheels. The railway was still a new thing in that particular part of the world, for mothers held up their babes to see it.|$|E
60|$|In the {{beginning}} of the first act the young girl Zoe appears by some great rocks in the desert, and sits down exhausted, to rest. Presently arrive a pauper couple stricken with age and infirmities; and they begin to mumble and pray to the Spirit of Life, who is said to inhabit that spot. The Spirit of Life appears; also Death--uninvited. They are (supposably) invisible. Death, tall, black-robed, corpse-faced, stands motionless and waits. The aged couple pray to the Spirit of Life for a means to prop up their existence and continue it. Their prayer fails. The Spirit of Life prophesies Zoe's martyrdom; it will take place before night. Soon Appelles arrives, young and vigorous and full of enthusiasm: he has led a host against the Persians and won the battle; he is the pet of fortune, rich, honoured, believed, 'Master of Palmyra'. He has heard that whoever stretches himself out on one of those rocks there and asks for a deathless life can have his wish. He laughs at the tradition, but <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> trial anyway. The invisible Spirit of Life warns him! 'Life without end can be regret without end.' But he persists: let him keep his youth, his strength, and his mental faculties unimpaired, and he will take all the risks. He has his desire.|$|E
