5|$|Beginning in 1943, Madgwick {{participated in}} {{government}} educational {{planning for the}} post-war years. He {{played a major role}} in the establishment of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme to provide government assistance to ex-servicemembers to complete or undertake university education. In 1944 Madgwick and colleagues began drafting their vision for post-war adult education and articulated their vision at the <b>Workers</b> <b>Education</b> Association of New South Wales Conference, held 10–11 March 1944 in Sydney. They followed-up the conference with a formal, published paper, which called for heavy Commonwealth government involvement and expenditures on adult education. Their proposed plan, however, was rejected by the Prime Minister's office, which, to Madgwick's disappointment selected a more modest program. Madgwick's active duty service ended in March 1946 and he was transferred to reserve officer status on 19 April 1946.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{educational}} reform tenets, polytechnic colleges were to {{give priority to}} admitting secondary vocational and technical school graduates and providing on-the-job training for qualified <b>workers.</b> <b>Education</b> reformers continued to press for the conversion of about 50 percent of upper secondary education into vocational education, which traditionally had been weak in the rural areas. Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into vocational middle schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.|$|E

50|$|The AFL was {{not opposed}} to <b>worker</b> <b>education,</b> however. Indeed, it sought to use <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> for its own purposes. To improve {{communication}} among <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> units of labor unions and independent labor colleges, James Maurer, John Brophy, and J.B.S. Hardman co-founded the Workers' Education Bureau (WEB) on December 31, 1921. Their goal was to reform and liberalize the labor policies of the AFL, popularize the emerging concept of industrial unionism, and instill {{a greater sense of}} militancy in the worker-members of the AFL. Maurer was elected president of the WEB.|$|R
25|$|During {{the mass}} high school {{education}} movement from 1910–40, {{there was an increase}} in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present {{high school education}}, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled <b>workers.</b> <b>Education</b> is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap. It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries.|$|E

This article reviews key moments and dynamics in the trajectory of <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> in South Africa. We argue that international developments, the rise of neoliberalism, and the negotiated compromise between the African National Congress (ANC) and the apartheid state, as well as corporatism resulted in changes to <b>worker</b> <b>education.</b> While the latter as it existed in the past has weakened, the centre of gravity has shifted to community organizations where various forms of learning and creativity continue. Despite the challenges and setbacks of recent years, there remains a significant legacy and influence of the traditions of <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> and militant trade unionism in South Africa, which can and should be drawn upon...|$|R

Thats entirely separate, should supplement <b>workers</b> <b>education</b> and go along with it. But it is not the same thing. <b>Workers</b> <b>education</b> is a specialized branch of adult education. It covers in general the economic and labor problems related to the experience of industrial workers, office workers, farmers, anything that touches the economic field. It is also and usually supplemented with much work in English, with elementary science, social psychology, with history, with a background of life in the United States. It touches: employers problems, trade union problems, the worker in the community as citizen, the governments relation to industry and to the labor movement." ...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 164 - 176. The South African {{literature}} on <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> notes developments in Cosatu's approach to education from the 1980 's to the 1990 's. I critically explore the changes and continuities evident in Cosatu's policy on <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> from 1985 to 1992. I examined the national documentation produced by Cosatu {{during these years}} and conducted selected interviews with 11 people in the Western Cape who were active in Cosatu during this period. I qualitatively categorise and analyse the information on Cosatu's policy. Secondary data, together with the interviews provide both illustrative and contextual information on the policy, practice and politics of Cosatu at that time. The approach to <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> contained in the policy from 1985 to 1988 can be distinguished {{from that of the}} 1989 - 1992 period. Cosatu's policy on <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> in the 1985 - 1988 period contained a critique of capitalist education, an argument that education should contribute to socialist transformation, and the assertion of an 'alternative' education founded on progressive principles. In the 1989 - 1992 period some of the progressive principles evident in the 1985 - 1988 policy on <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> were still asserted. However there were stark changes from the earlier policy. The 1989 - 1992 policy asserted that education should assist with reconstructing the economy and developing individual careers. Cosatu was no longer promoting an alternative to the existing capitalist education, but was pushing for workers to have greater access to this system. I characterise the dominant approach to <b>worker</b> <b>education</b> of the 1985 - 1988 period as 'radical' or 'transformatory', whereas the 1989 - 1992 period increasingly manifested elements of a 'service' and 'instrumental' approach, which I characterise as 'reformist'...|$|R
