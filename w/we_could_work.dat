According to him, Gaga was tired from playing bigger venues, and wanted to have the tour visit smaller venues for at least three-four days, or for three-six weeks. Bennett also {{explained that he was}} accustomed to playing in acoustic music halls and outdoor theaters, so Gaga had been looking at such options. [...] "I'm not interested in playing to 45,000 people a night, so [...] finding places where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> for three or four days, or three or four weeks, in one place at a time. That's how she wants to work with me.", the singer concluded. On New Year's Eve 2014, the duo started the Cheek to Cheek Tour by performing at the Cosmopolitan Casino of Las Vegas, making it their first concert in US following the album's release. They also performed at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and its scheduled a post-Grammy concert on February 8, 2015, at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, just after the conclusion of the ceremony. More shows were scheduled in 2015, including Hollywood Bowl on May 30; the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 8; and Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 19. Jesse Lawrence from Forbes reported that there was high demand for the tickets, leading to additional dates being added to the itinerary. He also noted that the concerts had a much higher ticket price than the average, especially in the secondary markets.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of [...] and At World's End, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers' 1987 novel On Stranger Tides, which they considered a good {{foundation on which}} to base [...] "a new chapter" [...] in the Pirates series. Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, [...] "but whenever you say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no way <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." [...] However, they denied {{that it would be a}} straight version of the novel: [...] "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation." [...] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, [...] "kind of a James Bond sort of thing", instead of the [...] "designed to be a trilogy" [...] structure of the previous installments. They hoped to [...] "design a story that would support new characters," [...] as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to [...] "streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.|$|E
