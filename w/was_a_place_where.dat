5|$|In the 16th century, St Thomas-a-Watering on Old Kent Road <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> {{religious}} dissenters {{and those}} {{found guilty of}} treason were publicly hanged. The road was rural in nature and several coaching inns were built alongside it. In the 19th century it acquired the name Old Kent Road and several industrial premises were set up to close to the Surrey Canal and a major business, the Metropolitan Gas Works was developed. In the 20th century, older property was demolished for redevelopment and Burgess Park was created. The Old Kent Road Baths opened around 1905 had Turkish and Russian bath facilities. In the 21st century, several retail parks and premises typical of out-of-town development have been built beside it while public houses have been redeveloped for other purposes.|$|E

25|$|On 9 August 2003, {{an open-air}} stage located 350ft {{from the sea}} on the sands of the Marina called Seerani Arangam, {{constructed}} in 1970, which was used by religious groups and political parties to address gatherings, was demolished by the state government in order to modernise the beach. This spot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> rallies were held for the freedom movement during the British Raj, and the stage was considered {{a symbol of the}} historical events that had taken place in the Marina.

25|$|Near Paw Paw, the {{engineers}} had no good solutions. If {{they followed the}} river, {{they would have to}} cross over to West Virginia to avoid the cliffs, and an agreement with the B railroad was that the canal would avoid {{the south side of the}} river, unless it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the railroad would not need it. So they took the more expensive decision to build a tunnel through the mountain. The initial cost estimate of $33,500 proved far too low. The tunnel was completed for $616,478.65 Among the components of the project, a kiln was built to provide bricks to line the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|The site of Ament's {{cabin was}} settled in 1829 when John L. Ament {{and his brother}} Justin staked claim on {{adjacent}} claims Berlin and Dover Townships, in present-day Bureau County, Illinois. Shortly after settling, Elijah Phillips bought Justin Ament's land and built his own cabin. West of Ament's and Phillips' settlement was a large Native American sugar camp, part of this camp was included in Ament's claim. The camp <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> Native Americans lived during the winter and spring on an annual basis. Prior to the attack, both Ament and Phillips were warned by Potawatomi chief Shabbona of impending danger to the settlers along Bureau Creek. The men had fled, with their families, leaving their goods and livestock behind. Eventually, {{it was decided that}} it was safe to return to the settlement to tend to the deserted possessions.|$|E
25|$|In the {{economic}} and technological circumstances of the time such an entrepôt (or to use the Dutch term: stapelmarkt) fulfilled important functions. The word has connotations of a duty-free port, but in an economic sense, a stapelmarkt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> commodities were temporarily physically stocked for future reexport. This was viable because of a legal monopoly for stockpiling a single commodity (wool), granted by a political ruler (like the staple ports designated by the kings of England in medieval times), but also more generally because of technical and economic reasons that still give certain advantages to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm. An important ancillary function of such a physical stock of commodities {{is that it makes}} it easier for merchants to even out supply fluctuations, and hence to control price gyrations in thin and volatile markets. Finally, where a physical market forms, market information can more easily be gathered. This was actually the most important economic function of a stapelmarkt in the primitive circumstances of the late 16th century.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the fact}} that during the time as a federal penitentiary no inmates were ever {{permanently}} held here, [...] A-Block was never modernized, so retained its [...] "flat strap-iron bars, key locks and spiral staircases" [...] from the original military prison. [...] Several inmates, however, were held briefly in A-Block before a hearing or transfer.

500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the term [...] "cottage garden" [...] might be applied even to as large and {{sophisticated}} a garden as Hidcote Manor, which Vita Sackville-West described as [...] "a cottage garden {{on the most}} glorified scale" [...] but where the colour harmonies were carefully contrived and controlled, as in the famous [...] "Red Borders". Sackville-West had taken similar models for her own [...] "cottage garden", one of many [...] "garden rooms" [...] at Sissinghurst Castle—her idea of a cottage garden <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> [...] "the plants grow in a jumble, flowering shrubs mingled with Roses, herbaceous plants with bulbous subjects, climbers scrambling over hedges, seedlings coming up wherever they have chosen to sow themselves". The cottage garden ideal was also spread by artists such as water-colourist Helen Allingham (1848–1926). Another influence was Margery Fish (1892–1969), whose garden survives at East Lambrook Manor.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} March 24, 1926, that new models, by Keck, {{were sent to the}} Fine Arts Commission. Although the {{commission}} admired Keck's portrait of Allen, they disliked his choice of Fay's Tavern for the reverse, and also disliked his enclosing the building in a wreath. On April 2, Moore wrote to Keck, advising him to get rid of both, and to put in place of the building a catamount, which would make a coin one could admire. The animal is a reference to Fay's Tavern, that was also known as the Catamount Tavern, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the Green Mountain Boys met. A copy of the letter was sent by Keck to Spargo, who wrote to Moore on the 12th, suggesting the Fine Arts Commission was overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate the design, but to resolve the matter, he would agree to the catamount: [...] "Life is too short to be spent in futile argument with the Commission of Fine Arts." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the name, Wolf Point, is unknown. In her 1856 memoir Wau-Bun, Juliette Kinzie states that 'the place was then called Wolf Point, from its having been the {{residence}} of an Indian named [...] "Moa-way," [...] or [...] "the Wolf."' Other alternate explanations are that it was so-named after the landlord of what would later be called the Wolf Point Tavern killed a ferocious wolf and hung a painted sign of a wolf outside his tavern to commemorate the event, or that it was named by a soldier at Fort Dearborn because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> wolves would gather at night. Originally the term Wolf Point referred {{to the west bank}} of the Chicago River at the fork junction of its branches, but it gradually came to refer to the whole region around the forks and in modern usage is often more specifically used to mean the plot of land on the north side of the forks. The confluence of the three branches of the river near Wolf Point provided inspiration for Chicago's Municipal Device, a Y-shaped, city identification symbol that can be seen on many buildings in Chicago, and on city owned vehicles.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} a {{settlement}} at Bramhall since Saxon times. According to Alfred Burton, who wrote about Bramhall in the late 19th century, the house {{has not always been}} in the present location, and was originally at Crow Holt Wood. This theory was rejected by another historian, Frederick Moorhouse, who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> animals would have been taken to be sorted. There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory. Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides, which two streams run through. It is a grade I listed building, and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century, with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries. It was originally accessed from the east side [...] the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream, then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side, reaching the courtyard on the other side. The main entrance is now {{on the side of the}} courtyard, in the west, because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888. The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building, in the courtyard: the service wing is on the left, the Great Hall is in the centre, and the Banqueting Hall is on the right. Before the 19th century, the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down between 1774 and 1819, because of its being neither required nor in vogue.|$|E
500|$|As a precautionary measure, in 1596 {{they were}} each arrested during Queen Elizabeth I's illness. [...] They were incarcerated at the White Lyon prison in 1601 for their {{involvement}} in the Earl of Essex's rebellion. Both were skilled swordsmen, and John was renowned for his courage. The Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond wrote that he possessed a [...] "good physique and sound constitution. [...] Rather on the tall side, his features were pleasing. [...] He was somewhat taciturn in manner, but very loyal to his friends, even if his friends were few". Christopher's appearance was slightly {{different from that of}} his brother, [...] "not like him in face, as being fatter and a lighter coloured hair and taller of person". According to Father John Gerard, John's involvement with Essex coincided with his conversion to Catholicism. [...] Gerard also noted that John's household, Twigmoor Hall in Lincolnshire, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> [...] "he had Priests come often, both for his spiritual comfort and their own in corporal helps", although the government's description, [...] "a Popish college for traitors", was somewhat less favourable. Following his conversion John became [...] "a man of exemplary life". Two years later, as the queen's health waned, a nervous government ensured that John and Christopher were again imprisoned, the English antiquarian William Camden describing them as men [...] "hunger-starved for innovation". [...] Christopher may have travelled to Spain in 1603 using the alias Anthony Dutton, seeking Spanish support for English Catholics, although biographer Mark Nicholls mentions that Dutton's role may have been attributed to Christopher by Fawkes and Thomas Wintour, held in the Tower of London after the failure of the plot.|$|E
500|$|Hirst {{produced}} {{a large number}} of important articles, chapters and books on Australian history. His academic interests were wide-ranging, including social, cultural and political history. Hirst's goal was to elucidate the qualities and characteristics of Australian society and how they had developed. Jeremy Sammut has described him as [...] "an elegant and outstanding stylist, as adept at clarifying complex issues by reducing them to their essentials as he was at crafting the pithy line that eliminated all doubt his interpretation was true and correct". In his historical work, Hirst's colleague at La Trobe University, Alan Frost, has noted that Hirst [...] "challenged orthodoxies and produced many new insights". He wrote two seminal books on colonial New South Wales which Frank Bongiorno has described as displaying [...] "a raw intellectual power": Convict Society and its Enemies (1983) and The Strange Birth of Colonial Democracy (1988) (both reprinted as Freedom on the Fatal Shore in 2008). Convict Society and its Enemies was particularly influential, arguing that rather than being a brutal slave society, early New South Wales <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> rights and freedoms were well-established from the beginning. Hirst's study of Federation, The Sentimental Nation, was also a ground-breaking work, arguing that national sentiment was more important than economics in uniting the nation. Alan Frost has described Hirst's shorter analyses as notable: [...] "Distance in Australia: Was It a Tyrant?" [...] (1975), his response to Geoffrey Blainey's most famous concept, [...] "deserves much more attention than it now receives"; his [...] "Egalitarianism" [...] (1986) challenges [...] "received wisdom about colonial life". Many of his best shorter pieces were collected in Sense and Nonsense in Australian History (2009). A major achievement of Hirst's was a project to index the Melbourne Argus newspaper (1860–1909).|$|E
