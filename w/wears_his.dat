5|$|Employees from Marvel Comics {{worked closely}} with Capcom's art design team to ensure that each {{character}} from their company was properly represented. As a result, several Marvel characters were modeled after their more recent comic book appearances. For example, Iron Man sports his Extremis Armor, while Wolverine <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> costume from Astonishing X-Men. The development team originally planned to have English and Japanese voice actors for all characters. Niitsuma eventually decided against it, stating that having the Marvel roster speaking Japanese did not mesh well with the characters' image.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. He rises, grabs his gun, and checks its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, as the camera pans to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he can count on Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by his thought dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} {{free exercise of religion}} problems to come to the courts is the conflict that arises when an attorney who is also a ordained Roman Catholic priest claims the right to appear before a criminal jury while <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> clerical collar. The New York Court of Appeals forbade a priest from <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> collar, while the New York Supreme Court granted an application by an attorney/priest to <b>wear</b> <b>his</b> collar. This decision was subsequently overruled by the appellate division. This Article examines arguments in favor of allowing a priest to <b>wear</b> <b>his</b> collar.

25|$|The Shadow Lord – The Shadow Lord {{was once}} the king of a small and {{insignificant}} kingdom. When Sauron offered {{him one of the}} Nine Rings, the promise of its power proved irresistible.

The Shadow Lord is a name applied to one of the nine Ringwraiths, representing the aspect of their dimming, shadowy influence on their environment. In-game, The Shadow Lord shrouds his allies in darkness, making it more difficult to fight against them.|$|E
25|$|Unlike some of Pisanello's other {{portrait}} medals, such {{as those}} of Leonello d'Este, the reverse of the medal of John presents no iconographic or allegorical mysteries. It shows the emperor on horseback, in profile to the right. Behind him, mounted on another horse, is a page or squire viewed from the rear and foreshortened. The emperor <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> distinctive hat and carries a bow on his left side and a quiver of arrows above his right leg. The double reigns of the emperor’s horse are visible and both horses possess elaborate straps over their hindquarters. The illustration conveys the arrest of a hunting expedition occasioned by John’s encounter with a pedestalled wayside cross. The gesture of the emperor’s raised right hand indicates his acknowledgement, in an act of piety, of the cross before him. The event takes place in a rocky landscape and is framed in the bottom portion by a Greek inscription: Ἕργον του Πισἀνου Ζωγρἀφου (‘The work of Pisano the painter’). This inscription is repeated in Latin within the top of the scene: OPVS • PISANI • PICTORIS.|$|E

25|$|The Great Caesar is {{the head}} of the Los Angeles {{division}} of the TNT group. He is a former Chicago mobster who made his fortune during the Prohibition era. After Al Capone's downfall, he became the most powerful mafioso in Chicago and held this position until his early retirement from business. He is independent from the New York division, but he still acts on Number One's orders. He usually dresses in white or grey suits, smokes Cuban cigars, is completely bald and always <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> trademark sunglasses. He also runs a flower shop, which, in contrast to the New York one, is much larger and successful than its counterpart. He has his own crew of TNT agents, consisting of Tim, Tom and Tumb, Bob's brothers, Professor Lamb, an inventor and former adversary of the TNT group, and Clodoveo, who remained for a while with him until he sent him back to Number One due to their constant quarrels. He enjoys fine wines, cigars, and he owns a panther, a bulldog and a gorilla, all tamed.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, {{she began}} work on Little Lord Fauntleroy with the {{serialization}} beginning in 1885 in St. Nicholas, and the publication in book form in 1886. Little Lord Fauntleroy received good reviews, became a best-seller in the United States and England, was translated into 12 languages, and secured Burnett's reputation as a writer. The story features a boy who dresses in elaborate velvet suits and <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> long hair in curls. The central character, Cedric, was modeled on Burnett's younger son Vivian, and the autobiographical aspects of Little Lord Fauntleroy occasionally led to disparaging remarks from the press. After the publication of Little Lord Fauntleroy, Burnett's reputation as a writer of children's books was fully established. In 1888 she won a lawsuit in England over the dramatic rights to Little Lord Fauntleroy, establishing a precedent that was incorporated into British copyright law in 1911. In response to a second incident of pirating her material into a dramatic piece, she wrote The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy, which was produced on stage in London and on Broadway. The play went on to make her {{as much money as}} the book.|$|E

500|$|The boxing {{scene was}} {{intended}} to differentiate the relationship between Q and Sisko from that of Q and Picard. [...] "Picard is an explorer, and in some ways, very much an intellectual. Sisko is a builder, {{a different kind of}} guy. He <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> heart a little more on his sleeve, and he acts on emotion, on instinct, more than Picard", Wolfe explained. John de Lancie offered a similar opinion: [...] "Q's relationship with Picard has always been a battle of wits, but I come into Deep Space Nine, and Sisko just bopped me on the nose! From a character point of view, that's a very big difference." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid {{states that}} what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl {{apart from other}} female {{characters}} was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, [...] "she <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> symbol on her chest, {{but she is not}} his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden." [...] Because of the fact she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, [...] "Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male." [...] Historian Peter Sanderson observed that Barbara Gordon's Batgirl reflected the Women's liberation movement of the 1960s.|$|E

Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is not pleased that he was not selected to replace Michael, believing that Michael put in a good recommendation for him. Michael becomes disturbed, however, when Deangelo wants to make some changes, such as how Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) answers the phone.|$|E

500|$|In {{creating}} the visual look for Miles, Pichelli followed her usual practice of approaching the design by giving {{thought to the}} character's personality, including the background that influenced it, and the distinctive traits that he would exhibit, such as the clothing he <b>wears,</b> <b>his</b> body language and expressions. Pichelli also designed Spider-Man's new costume, a mostly black outfit with red webbing and a red spider logo. Pichelli had worked on four issues of Ultimate Spider-Man before she was approached {{to work on the}} new title with Miles Morales. Pichelli, who works with a Cintiq 12wx graphic tablet, added more screentones to her illustrations to give what she called [...] "a more 'pop' feeling to the book", which she felt would be fitting to the series.|$|E

500|$|Depp wears a dreadlock wig in a rock-and-roll {{approach}} to a pirate aesthetic. He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects in his hair, influenced by Keith Richards' habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels; Sparrow's decorations include his [...] "piece of eight". Sparrow wears kohl around his eyes, which was inspired by Depp's study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates, and he wore contacts that acted as sunglasses. Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp, although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting The Curse of the Black Pearl, and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels. Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth. Sparrow <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids stick up when Depp lay down. Sparrow has numerous tattoos, and has been branded a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett, underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.|$|E
