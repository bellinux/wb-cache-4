60|$|As trade {{alone has}} peopled those countries, so trading with them has raised them also to a prodigy {{of wealth and}} opulence; and <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now</b> the {{ordinary}} planters at Jamaica and Barbadoes rise to immense estates, riding in their coaches and six, especially at Jamaica, with twenty or thirty negroes on foot running before them whenever they please to appear in public.|$|E

60|$|Surprized, to be sure, {{with this}} sudden and yet glorious Work of the Almighty; for the Creation was enough, with its Lustre, even to surprize the Devils; they might {{reasonably}} be supposed {{to start out}} of their dark Retreat, and with a Curiosity not below the Seraphic Dignity; for {{these are some of}} the things which the Angels desire to look into, to take a flight thro' all the amazing Systems of the fix'd Suns or Stars, which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now</b> but at a Distance, and only make Astronomical Guesses at.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{if we have}} God abiding with us, {{and filling}} us with His Eternal Life, what more do we need for life, or death, or eternity, or eternities of eternities? For we shall live in and with and by God, who can never die or change, an {{everlasting}} life of love, whereof St. Paul says, that though prophecies shall fail, and tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall vanish away, because all that we know now is but in part, and all that <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now</b> is through a glass darkly, yet Love shall never fail, but abide for ever and ever.|$|E
60|$|Many of {{the animals}} from Poissy have come here. On the arrival of each drove, it was turned into yonder ample space, where each butcher who had bought, {{selected}} his own purchases. Some, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now,</b> in these long perspectives of stalls with a high over-hanging roof of wood and open tiles rising above the walls. While they rest here, before being slaughtered, {{they are required to}} be fed and watered, and the stalls must be kept clean. A stated amount of fodder must always be ready in the loft above; and the supervision is of the strictest kind. The same regulations apply to sheep and calves; for which, portions of these perspectives are strongly railed off. All the buildings are of the strongest and most solid description.|$|E

60|$|The {{energetic}} {{culture of}} the Strawberry is of recent date, and the cultivated varieties can in most cases be classed under some one of the above native stocks. As the American strawberries cross so freely and spontaneously, we can hardly doubt that they will ultimately become inextricably confused. We find, indeed, that horticulturists at present disagree under which class to rank some few of the varieties; and a writer in the 'Bon Jardinier' of 1840 remarks that formerly {{it was possible to}} class all of them under some one species, but that now this is quite impossible with the American forms, the new English varieties having completely filled up the gaps between them. (10/107. 'Le Fraisier' par le Comte L. de Lambertye pages 221, 230.) The blending together of two or more aboriginal forms, which {{there is every reason to}} believe has occurred with some of our anciently cultivated productions, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now</b> actually occurring with our strawberries.|$|E
60|$|In {{her brown}} crisp hair is {{the gleam of}} a golden snake, and she is clad in a silken robe of dark violet that clings tightly to her limbs, more expressing than hiding them; the colour of this dress is like the colour of a purple sea-shell, broken here and there with slight gleams of silver and pink and azure; it has a strange {{metallic}} lustre like the iris-neck of the dove. Were this Mr. Burne-Jones's only work it would be enough of itself to make him rank as a great painter. The picture is full of magic; and the colour is truly a spirit dwelling on things and making them expressive to the spirit, for the delicate tones of grey, and green, and violet seem to convey to us the idea of languid sleep, and even the hawthorn-blossoms have lost their wonted brightness, and are more like the pale moonlight to which Shelley compared them, than the sheet of summer snow <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now</b> in our English fields.|$|E
60|$|Eph {{took his}} fiddle and scraped away to his heart's {{content in the}} parlor, while the girls, after a short rest, set the table and made all ready to dish up the dinner when that {{exciting}} moment came. It {{was not at all}} the sort of table <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now,</b> but would look very plain and countrified to us, with its green-handled knives and two-pronged steel forks; its red-and-white china, and pewter platters, scoured till they shone, with mugs and spoons to match, and a brown jug for the cider. The cloth was coarse, but white as snow, and the little maids had seen the blue-eyed flax grow, out of which their mother wove the linen they had watched and watered while it bleached in the green meadow. They had no napkins and little silver; but the best tankard and Ma's few wedding spoons were set forth in state. Nuts and apples at the corners gave an air, and the place of honor was left in the middle for the oranges yet to come.|$|E

60|$|We {{shall not}} mention the number of clients thronging to Mr. Whipple's office to consult Mr. Brice. These things are humiliating. Some of Stephen's income came from {{articles}} in the newspapers of that day. What funny newspapers they were, {{the size of a}} blanket! No startling headlines such as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now,</b> but a continued novel among the advertisements on the front page and verses from some gifted lady of the town, signed Electra. And often a story of pure love, but more frequently of ghosts or other eerie phenomena taken from a magazine, or an anecdote of a cat or a chicken. There were letters from citizens who had the mania of print, bulletins of different ages {{from all parts of the}} Union, clippings out of day-before-yesterday's newspaper of Chicago or Cincinnati to three-weeks letters from San Francisco, come by the pony post to Lexington and then down the swift Missouri. Of course, there was news by telegraph, but that was precious as fine gold,--not to be lightly read and cast aside.|$|E
6000|$|Looking {{back on the}} Victorian era, whose ripeness, decline, and 'fall-of' is in {{some sort}} pictured in [...] "The Forsyte Saga," [...] <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now</b> that we have but jumped out of a frying-pan into a fire. It would be {{difficult}} to substantiate a claim that the case of England was better in 1913 than it was in 1886, when the Forsytes assembled at Old Jolyon's to celebrate the engagement of June to Philip Bosinney. And in 1920, when again the clan gathered to bless the marriage of Fleur with Michael Mont, the state of England is as surely too molten and bankrupt as in the eighties it was too congealed and low-percented. If these chronicles had been a really scientific study of transition one would have dwelt probably on such factors as the invention of bicycle, motor-car, and flying-machine; the arrival of a cheap Press; the decline of country life and increase of the towns; the birth of the Cinema. Men are, in fact, quite unable to control their own inventions; they at best develop adaptability to the new conditions those inventions create.|$|E
60|$|I was {{interested}} {{in looking at the}} busts of the Triumvirs, Antony, Augustus, and Lepidus. The first two are men of intellect, evidently, though they do not recommend themselves to one's affections by their physiognomy; but Lepidus has the strangest, most commonplace countenance that can be imagined,--small-featured, weak, such a face as you meet anywhere in a man of no mark, but are amazed to find in one of the three foremost men of the world. I suppose that it is these weak and shallow men, when chance raises them above their proper sphere, who commit enormous crimes without any such restraint as stronger men would feel, and without any retribution in the depth of their conscience. These old Roman busts, of which there are so many in the Vatican, have often a most lifelike aspect, a striking individuality. One recognizes them as faithful portraits, just as certainly as if the living originals were standing beside them. The arrangement of the hair and beard too, in many cases, is just what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now,</b> the fashions of two thousand years ago having come round again.|$|E

5000|$|Within {{the context}} of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine gas dispute in early January 2009, Nikolai Petrov, an analyst with the Carnegie Moscow Center said: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>see</b> right <b>now</b> is the {{dominant}} role of Putin. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> him as a real head of state. ...

6000|$|True, {{the best}} part of him, perhaps almost all the good part of him, spent itself in words, and must be looked for, not in his life, but in his books. But in those books it can be found; and if you look through them, you will see that he has not touched upon a subject without taking, on the whole, the right, and pure, and lofty view of it. Howsoever extravagant he may be in his notions of poetic licence, that licence is never with him a synonym for licentiousness. Whatever is tender and true, {{whatever}} is chivalrous and high-minded, he loves at first sight, and reproduces it lovingly. And it may be possible that his own estimate of his poems was not altogether wrong; that his words may have awakened here and there in others a love for that which is morally as well as physically beautiful, and may have kept alive in their hearts the recollection that, both for the bodies and the souls of men forms of life far nobler and fairer than those which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>now</b> are possible; that they have appeared, in fragments at least, already on the earth; that they are destined, perhaps, to reappear and combine themselves in some ideal state, and in ...|$|E
60|$|I no {{not pretend}} {{to be able to}} explain to you the whole meaning of this text, or even more than a very small part of it. For it speaks of God; of God the Holy Spirit. And God is {{boundless}}; and, therefore, every text which speaks of God is boundless too, as God is. No man can ever see the whole meaning of it, or do more than understand dimly a little of its truth. But what we can see, we must think over and make use of. What can <b>we</b> <b>see,</b> <b>now,</b> from this text? First, we may see that the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, is a person. Not a mere thing, or a state of our own hearts, or a feeling in us, or a power, like the powers and laws by which the trees and plants grow, and the sun and moon move in their courses; but a person, just as each of us is a person. He, the Holy Spirit, gives life to trees and plants, sun and moon: but He is not their life. He gives them their life; and, therefore, that life of theirs is not He, or He could not give it; for you can only give something which is not you.|$|E
60|$|The {{expansive}} {{nature of}} truth {{comes to our}} succor, elastic, not to be surrounded. Man helps himself by larger generalizations. The lesson of life is practically to generalize; to believe what the years and the centuries say against the hours; to resist the usurpation of particulars; to penetrate to their catholic sense. Things seem to say one thing, and say the reverse. The appearance is immoral; the result is moral. Things seem to tend downward, to justify despondency, to promote rogues, to defeat the just; and, by knaves, as by martyrs, the just cause is carried forward. Although knaves win in every political struggle, although society seems to be delivered over {{from the hands of}} one set of criminals into the hands of another set of criminals, as fast as the government is changed, and the march of civilization is a train of felonies, yet, general ends are somehow answered. <b>We</b> <b>see,</b> <b>now,</b> events forced on, which seem to retard or retrograde the civility of ages. But the world-spirit is a good swimmer, and storms and waves cannot drown him. He snaps his finger at laws; and so, throughout history, heaven seems to affect low and poor means. Through the years and the centuries, through evil agents, through toys and atoms, a great and beneficent tendency irresistibly streams.|$|E
