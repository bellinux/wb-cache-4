40|$|Exclusive {{bus lane}} (EBL) is {{typically}} {{located in the}} roadway median, and is accessed by weaving across the GPLs(general purpose lanes) before entering from the left lane of the GPLs. To maximize the potential for successful EBL operations, a critical design issue that requires special attention is the length of bus weaving section before entering EBL. The process of developing guidelines {{for the length of}} bus weaving section can be supported by a sensitivity analysis of performance measure (safety) with respect to the bus <b>weaving</b> <b>distance.</b> However, field data are difficult to obtain due to inherent complexity in creating performance measure (safety) samples under various interesting flows and bus <b>weaving</b> <b>distance</b> that are keys to research success. In this paper, VISSIM simulation is applied to simulate the operation of roadway weaving areas with EBL, and based on vehicle trajectory data from microscopic traffic simulation models, the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) computes the number of surrogate conflicts (or degree of safety) with respect to the bus <b>weaving</b> <b>distance.</b> Then, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model using safety data (number of surrogate conflicts) is developed. Finally, guidelines for bus <b>weaving</b> <b>distance</b> are established based on the developed MLR. Developed guidelines explicitl...|$|E
40|$|Shadow of the Headframe is {{a feature}} length essay film that paints a complex {{portrait}} of the Attawapiskat First Nation – {{a place that is}} a homeland for some, and a new frontier for others. In the shadow of a De Beers diamond mine, the remote indigenous community lurches from crisis to crisis, while facing eroding treaty rights and an inability to directly benefit from resource revenues. Filmed over five years, Shadow of the Headframe follows Attawapiskat’s journey from obscurity and into the international spotlight during the protest movement, Idle No More. <b>Weaving</b> together great <b>distances,</b> intimate everyday scenes, and archive images, the documentary chronicles the First Nation’s fight for awareness and justice in the face of repeated attempts to thwart their demands. This supporting document provides insight into the film’s theoretical foundations, production process, and creative treatment, as well as background information on the historical and socioeconomic context...|$|R

According to Gregory of Tours, a contemporary historian, [...] "king Charibert married Ingoberga, by {{whom he had}} a daughter who afterwards married a husband in Kent and was taken there. At that time Ingoberga had in her service two daughters of a certain poor man, of whom the first was called Marcovefa, who wore the robe of a nun, {{and the other was}} Merofled. The king was very much in love with them. They were, as I have said, the daughters of a worker in wool. Ingoberga was jealous that they were loved by the king and secretly gave the father work to do, thinking that when the king saw this he would dislike his daughters. While he was working she called the king. He expected to see something strange, but only saw this man at a <b>distance</b> <b>weaving</b> the king's wool. Upon this he was angry and left Ingoberba and married Merofled." ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{people might}} not reflect upon {{textiles}} as anything more than the soft material in our clothes. As a crafts practitioner, I gain knowledge of woven materials that go beyond that. The knowledge of weaving and materials is developing the ideas that form the concept of this project. From the tacit knowledge, derived from years of practically working with textile materials, an intellectual understanding of materials and the worlds they construct is growing. In this project, I decipher my own ideas of the woven structure in order to invite others to experience the universe within textiles. I look at the weave as a structure, built up by small particles in forms of threads. If seeing the <b>weave</b> from a <b>distance,</b> each repeated pattern can in turn be perceived as the smallest element. By seeing woven materials {{from more than one}} perspective, I believe that the understanding of the construction itself can develop. As this understanding grows, so does the ability to judge the quality of the material. In this line of thought, the tools used to reflect upon what materials are, how they are made and what they signify, becomes greater. To visualise the knowledge I have of the textile structures I make, I work with a waffle weave structure, together with a dyeing technique called Ikat. I also draw connections between the woven structure and that of a map – as a tool that humans use to understand their surroundings. The use of perspectives and scale is another tool that is used to widen our perception of the world around us. In order to create an experience of the universe within textiles and to invite others into that world, I draw parallels between the miniature scale of the woven material and larger, architectural structures. The final outcome of this project is a textile installation, consisting of three weavings that together form a larger construction. The construction is open for people to enter and experience. Inside the construction a smaller woven piece is presented as a map over the woven world. This weaving initially contains the same information as the large structure, but on a much smaller scale.
