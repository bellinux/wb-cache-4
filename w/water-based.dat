5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} treatments in {{many forms}} are available, which are {{often referred to as}} cosmeceuticals. Certain types of makeup may be useful to mask acne. In those with oily skin, a <b>water-based</b> product is often preferred.|$|E
5|$|On Mars, {{observations}} of the Phoenix Mars lander reveal that <b>water-based</b> snow crystals occur at high latitudes. Additionally, carbon dioxide precipitates from clouds during the Martian winters at the poles and contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound, which is the principal component of that planet's ice caps.|$|E
5|$|As a {{publicity}} stunt {{for the opening of}} The Simpsons Movie on 16 July 2007, a giant Homer Simpson brandishing a doughnut was outlined in <b>water-based</b> biodegradable paint {{to the left of the}} Cerne Abbas giant. This act displeased local neopagans, who pledged to perform rain magic to wash the figure away.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly used. These were good at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than <b>water-based</b> lubricants.|$|E
5|$|If possible, {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; <b>water-based</b> varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E
5|$|Julian {{supervised}} {{the assembly of}} the plant at Glidden {{when he arrived in}} 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of <b>water-based</b> paints.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the journey}} resumes, the train moves across an {{overpass}} and passes by the façade of the It's a Small World <b>water-based</b> dark ride attraction before reaching a fuel pump {{disguised as a}} boulder, where the train stops if the locomotive needs to be refueled. From this point, the train cuts across an access road and goes underneath the track of the Disneyland Monorail before stopping at Tomorrowland Station in the Tomorrowland section.|$|E
5|$|Since {{trade and}} {{commerce}} typically involve items significantly more massive than one gram, and since a mass standard made of water would be inconvenient and unstable, {{the regulation of}} commerce necessitated the manufacture of a practical realization of the <b>water-based</b> definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass standard was made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gram—the kilogram.|$|E

5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to <b>water-based</b> lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} of <b>water-based</b> and terrestrial insects, flying insects, such as {{various types of}} fly, and, to a lesser extent, tiny crustaceans and algae. Field work on Narrabeen Lakes showed that Pacific blue-eyes spent time near the surface looking for dead flying insects, consuming anything below their mouth gape size. This varied from around 2.5 to 3.5mm, and was proportional {{to the length of}} the fish. The Pacific blue-eye forages using vision, and the turbidity of the water affects its ability to find food.|$|E
5|$|<b>Water-based</b> {{recreation}} {{is available}} near the pass as well, {{particularly on the}} Roaring Fork side. At the Grottos climbing cliffs eight miles (14.4km) {{to the west of}} the pass, a short trail leads to an area along the river known as the Devil's Punchbowl, with high stone cliffs on either side and waterfalls. It is a popular swimming hole due to its deep and cool waters. The river is popular with anglers casting for trout as well, and some even make the hike from the pass up to Blue Lake for its lake and cutthroat trout stocks.|$|E
5|$|Because Ratatouille is {{intended}} to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week in the city to properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. There are also many <b>water-based</b> sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint department coordinator Kesten Migdal) jumped into Pixar's swimming pool wearing a chef's uniform and apron to see which parts of the suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water absorption.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 {{days off}} the California coast, {{as all the}} {{shooting}} required in the Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was shot in a monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was shot in a former air hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast had to wear wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not come inside and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating <b>water-based</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time few players had seen or played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a <b>water-based</b> playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E
5|$|On <b>water-based</b> pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce {{friction}} {{and increase the}} speed at which the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile third-generation or 3G pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a <b>water-based</b> alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent the human eye. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination {{to be taken into account}} in the rendering. Refraction effects were added to make light account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate <b>water-based</b> effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{there has}} been rapid growth in the tissue residue {{approach}} to toxicology. The <b>water-based</b> approach has been re-evaluated due to challenges in assessing the toxicity of bioaccumulating chemicals. <b>Water-based</b> approaches are not always an accurate estimation of the concentration of a bioaccumulating chemical in an organism, nor does the <b>water-based</b> approach incorporate the multiple routes of exposure of an organism to a toxicant and the additive effects across these routes.|$|E
25|$|Rollerball pens {{employ the}} same ballpoint mechanics, {{but with the}} use of <b>water-based</b> inks instead of {{oil-based}} inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the <b>water-based</b> inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. <b>Water-based</b> inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to smearing—posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)—and running, should the writing surface become wet.|$|E
