500|$|Quesada {{confirmed}} in April 2014 that the Netflix series {{would be set}} within the MCU. Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe {{there are thousands of}} heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> seen in the Marvel movies." [...] In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release. A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the [...] "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out {{more than one or two}} [...] year ... The complex one is really The Defenders. The Defenders production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." [...] He also noted on potential spin-offs that [...] "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" [...] into their own series at some point, with Netflix ordering Marvel's The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil, that April. Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the Defenders series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning I presented myself to the commandant with a complaint, having been prompted thereto by Sergeant Corney. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> been assigned to any duty, and {{each member of the}} garrison seemed particularly averse to allowing us to even help ourselves.|$|R

2500|$|Peru's {{response}} to the events taking place in Ecuador was provided by foreign minister Carlos Concha, who stated, [...] "In Peru <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> lost our heads. Our country is {{in a process of}} prosperous development and the Government heads would have to be completely mad to think of war." [...] The social situation of Peru at that time was undergoing major changes, with the social reforms begun by president Augusto B. Leguia (which were aimed at improving roads, sanitation, industrial development, and promoting the general welfare of Peru's Native American population) being continued by president General Oscar Benavides. Economically, Peru claimed to be attempting to run on a balanced budget, but Peru still held a large debt despite its positive foreign trade. However, despite these claims, Peru also began to mobilize its troops to its border with Ecuador in order to match the Ecuadorian troops which had been deployed to the dispute zone.|$|E

2500|$|Daredevil is {{the first}} of the ordered Netflix series, and is {{followed}} by Marvel's Jessica Jones, Marvel's Luke Cage, and Marvel's Iron Fist, which lead to the miniseries, Marvel's The Defenders. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, [...] "It's quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In December 2014, Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> seen in the Marvel movies." [...] Dawson later elaborated that [...] "When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit [...] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs—bones are going to break. People aren't hitting each other and nothing's going to happen because they're indestructible. These are people. They're vulnerable and you get to experience that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{songs were}} set to music by Francesco Berger and Lady Charlesmont, and later on by Margaret Ruthven Lang, Arthur Foote, Ethelbert Nevin, and many others. Marston wrote her, [...] "Much as we all love and admire your work, {{it seems to me}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> fully {{realized}} the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':— [...] "'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'" [...] Marston wrote her again concerning [...] "The House of Death" [...] {{that it was one of}} the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. [...] "No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without—light girdling darkness—and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced." [...] The poem of [...] "The House of Death" [...] is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, [...] "Laus Veneris," [...] inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.|$|E
2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{were more}} temperate, but {{generally}} agreed the production was a failure. They were most divided over Pousseur's musical collage technique. Claudio Sartori found the quotations [...] "pointless", while the critic for La Stampa was noncommital, saying only that [...] "Pousseur is a musician of proven dexterity, {{aligned with the}} most up-to-date ranks of the avant-garde" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ). Peter Heyworth, on the other hand, found the [...] "elaborate collage of citation, parody, pastiche and genuine composition" [...] to have been [...] "carried off with considerable panache", and admitted that Votre Faust is [...] "utterly unlike any opera I have ever heard, and I {{would like to believe}} that it represents a major attempt to bring music and drama into a new sort of relationship" [...] but, on the whole, found it [...] "nothing more than a box of tricks; full of sound and signifying precious little. In the worst sense of the word, an experiment" [...] Luciano Berio, a colleague and friend of Pousseur, was wholly enthusiastic about [...] "a score that I love deeply for innumerable reasons", but nevertheless admitted the production was a failure—a failure which he blamed partly on Butor's text, but more emphatically on the stage design and [...] "what is normally defined as directing but in our case is revealed as a gratuitous succession of inconsistent poses perpetrated by a pair of naïve amateurs inexplicably dragged to Milan by M. Butor" [...] Sartori concurred, describing the production as [...] "heavy" [...] and the sets [...] "ugly" [...] In an interview conducted shortly after the Milan performances, one of the singers confirmed that stage direction was practically nonexistent, so that the performers were forced largely to improvise their movements. After protracted wrangling that began with the first rehearsals in the theatre and continued through most of the run, it was finally agreed to do the fourth and last performance in concert form [...] The instrumentalists were described as [...] "bravissimi" [...] (talented) and the singers as [...] "strenui" [...] (stalwart) , and although Jean Topart in the role of Mondor was generally admired, the other actors' performances were scarcely mentioned. One exception was made by Berio, who paid Roger Mollien a backhanded compliment: [...] "The 'protagonist' Henri, ... is, in the words of Butor, a perfect cretin, equaled in this respect only by 'actor-director' Mollien trying to portray the part", who in the end, according to Berio, uttered only two coherent sentences: [...] "C'est que nous n'avons pas encore abordé la question du livret" [...] (<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> addressed the issue of the libretto), and [...] "s'il y a eu un coupable dans l'affaire, c'est moi, tu le sais bien, Maggy" [...] (If there has been a guilty man in this case it's me, you know that, Maggy) [...]|$|E
