50|$|This {{structure}} also {{enables a}} 'natural ventilation' through the selective opening of windows. The 50 cm {{gap between the}} 17 cm thick floors and the glass encasing also allows for vertical ventilation, if needs be helped by opening glass hatches in the roof. And the glass allows for maximum entry of sunlight. Peutz reported after one year of use of the building, that experience had shown that the 50 cm gap was more than enough. In the early years, the gap has even been reduced in size in some places. In winter only the <b>window</b> <b>flaps</b> in the glass encasing need to be opened and the roof hatches can remain closed. During summer, on the sunny side the curtains should be closed and the hatches opened (note, though, that the south side is the one without glass). The result is a 'double wall' of glass on the outer side and curtains on the inner side, with an upward draft caused by the Sun's heat. This suffices for ventilation and the two surface ducts (as shown on the drawings) were partly intended for mechanical ventilation (with an exhauster fan), but this {{has turned out to}} be unnecessary. During winter, heating is done with a hot water installation (of course fuelled with coal) with natural circulation. The radiators along the windows now provide the heat for the circulation. The installed pumps have turned out to be unnecessary. The airtight glass walls have turned out to be better insulators than thought. Also, the mass of the concrete is such a good heat accumulator that extra time heating up the building in the morning has turned out unnecessary and there have never been any major temperature changes. This technology is being rediscovered and used, for example, by Canadian architect Chris Holmes in his energy-saving designs.|$|R

40|$|Positional {{variations}} of the maxillary cuspid are frequently encountered in dental practice. In such cases, because of its devious path to reach {{its position in the}} arch, it often gets impacted and becomes difficult to bring into occlusion.

Sixty-six cases of unerupted maxillary canines were treated by two different surgical exposures and methods (<b>window</b> and open-closed <b>flap</b> techniques) and were orthodontically moved into occlusion. The etiology, diagnosis and evaluation of the impaction, as well as the possible orthomechanics used to arrange the canine's position, need a clear understanding to plan a final treatment.

Purpose: This study assessed the clinical outcome of such technique {{during the first year}} of loading. Material and Methods: Fifteen patients with a mean residual bone height of 6. 2  mm were consecutively recruited for sinus lifting. After opening a replaceable bone window, the membrane was dissected from the sinus walls. A total of 28 implants were placed in the residual crest and they kept the membrane lifted upwards. After <b>window</b> repositioning, the <b>flap</b> was sutured. A 6 -month healing period was allowed. Patients were re-examined after 12 months of loading. Results: All the implants survived at the end of the follow-up. The 5. 5  mm mean bone reformation was significantly lower than the 8. 2  mm mean membrane lift achieved after implant placement. Regeneration at the distal surface of the most posterior implants was significantly less than at other aspects. The height of membrane lift was not correlated with the amount of regenerated bone.

40|$|Understanding {{the tumor}} {{microenvironment}} {{is critical to}} characterizing how cancers operate and predicting their response to treatment. We describe a novel, high-resolution coregistered photoacoustic (PA) and pulse echo (PE) ultrasound system used to image the tumor microenvironment. Compared to traditional optical systems, the platform provides complementary contrast and important depth information. Three mice are implanted with a dorsal skin <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chamber and injected with PC- 3 prostate tumor cells transfected with green fluorescent protein. The ensuing tumor invasion is mapped during three weeks or more using simultaneous PA and PE imaging at 25 MHz, combined with optical and fluorescent techniques. Pulse echo imaging provides details of tumor structure and the surrounding environment with 100 -μm 3 resolution. Tumor size increases dramatically with an average volumetric growth rate of 5. 35 mm 3 ∕day, correlating well with 2 -D fluorescent imaging (R = 0. 97, p < 0. 01). Photoacoustic imaging is able to track the underlying vascular network and identify hemorrhaging, while PA spectroscopy helps classify blood vessels according to their optical absorption spectrum, suggesting variation in blood oxygen saturation. Photoacoustic and PE imaging are safe, translational modalities that provide enhanced depth resolution and complementary contrast to track the tumor microenvironment, evaluate new cancer therapies, and develop molecular contrast agents in vivo...|$|R

40|$|When {{monitoring}} {{response to}} cancer therapy, {{it is important}} to differentiate changes in glucose tracer uptake caused by altered delivery versus a true metabolic shift. Here, we propose an optical imaging method to quantify glucose uptake and correct for in vivo delivery effects. Glucose uptake was measured using a fluorescent D-glucose derivative 2 -(N-(7 -Nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) Amino) - 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 -NBDG) in mice implanted with dorsal skin <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chambers. Additionally, vascular oxygenation (SO 2) was calculated using only endogenous hemoglobin contrast. Results showed that the delivery factor proposed for correction, "RD", reported on red blood cell velocity and injected 2 -NBDG dose. Delivery-corrected 2 -NBDG uptake (2 -NBDG 60 /RD) inversely correlated with blood glucose in normal tissue, indicating sensitivity to glucose demand. We further applied our method in metastatic 4 T 1 and nonmetastatic 4 T 07 murine mammary adenocarcinomas. The ratio 2 -NBDG 60 /RD was increased in 4 T 1 tumors relative to 4 T 07 tumors yet average SO 2 was comparable, suggesting a shift toward a "Warburgian" (aerobic glycolysis) metabolism in the metastatic 4 T 1 line. In heterogeneous regions of both 4 T 1 and 4 T 07, 2 -NBDG 60 /RD increased slightly but significantly as vascular oxygenation decreased, indicative of the Pasteur effect in both tumors.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an optical}} strategy using intravital microscopy of dorsal skin <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chamber models to image glucose uptake and vascular oxygenation in vivo. Glucose uptake was imaged using a fluorescent glucose analog, 2 -[N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diaxol- 4 -yl) amino]- 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG). SO 2 was imaged using the differential absorption properties of oxygenated [HbO 2] and deoxygenated hemoglobin [dHb]. This study {{was carried out}} on two sibling murine mammary adenocarcinoma lines, 4 T 1 and 4 T 07. 2 -NBDG uptake in the 4 T 1 tumors was lowest when rates of delivery and clearance were lowest, indicating perfusion-limited uptake in poorly oxygenated tumor regions. For increasing rates of delivery that were still lower than the glucose consumption rate (as measured in vitro), both 2 -NBDG uptake and the clearance rate from the tumor increased. When the rate of delivery of 2 -NBDG exceeded the glucose consumption rate, 2 -NBDG uptake decreased with any further increase in rate of delivery, but the clearance rate continued to increase. This inflection point was not observed in the 4 T 07 tumors due to an absence of low delivery rates close to the glucose consumption rate. In the 4 T 07 tumors, 2 -NBDG uptake increased with increasing rates of delivery at low rates of clearance. Our results demonstrate that 2 -NBDG uptake in tumors {{is influenced by the}} rates of delivery and clearance of the tracer. The rates of delivery and clearance are, in turn, dependent on vascular oxygenation of the tumors. Knowledge of the kinetics o...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that the}} arteriolar input in window chamber tumours is limited in number and is constrained to enter the tumour from one surface, and that the pO 2 of tumour arterioles is lower than in comparable arterioles of normal tissues. On average, the vascular pO 2 in vessels of the upper surface of these tumours {{is lower than the}} pO 2 of vessels on the fascial side, suggesting that there may be steep vascular longitudinal gradients (defined as the decline in vascular pO 2 along the afferent path of blood flow) that contribute to vascular hypoxia on the upper surface of the tumours. However, we have not previously measured tissue pO 2 on both surfaces of these chambers in the same tumour. In this report, we investigated the hypothesis that the anatomical constraint of arteriolar supply {{from one side of the}} tumour results in longitudinal gradients in pO 2 sufficient in magnitude to create vascular hypoxia in tumours grown in dorsal <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chambers. Fischer- 344 rats had dorsal <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chambers implanted in the skin fold with simultaneous transplantation of the R 3230 AC tumour. Tumours were studied at 9 – 11 days after transplantation, at a diameter of 3 – 4 mm; the tissue thickness was 200 μm. For magnetic resonance microscopic imaging, gadolinium DTPA bovine serum albumin (BSA-DTPA-Gd) complex was injected i. v., followed by fixation in 10 % formalin and removal from the animal. The sample was imaged at 9. 4 T, yielding voxel sizes of 40 μm. Intravital microscopy was used to visualize the position and number of arterioles entering window chamber tumour preparations. Phosphorescence life time imaging (PLI) was used to measure vascular pO 2. Blue and green light excitations of the upper and lower surfaces of window chambers were made (penetration depth of light ~ 50 vs > 200 μm respectively). Arteriolar input into window chamber tumours was limited to 1 or 2 vessels, and appeared to be constrained to the fascial surface upon which the tumour grows. PLI of the tumour surface indicated greater hypoxia with blue compared with green light excitation (P < 0. 03 for 10 th and 25 th percentiles and for per cent pixels < 10 mmHg). In contrast, illumination of the fascial surface with blue light indicated less hypoxia compared with illumination of the tumour surface (P < 0. 05 for 10 th and 25 th percentiles and for per cent pixels < 10 mmHg). There was no significant difference in pO 2 distributions for blue and green light excitation from the fascial surface nor for green light excitation when viewed from either surface. The PLI data demonstrates that the upper surface of the tumour is more hypoxic because blue light excitation yields lower pO 2 values than green light excitation. This is further verified in the subset of chambers in which blue light excitation of the fascial surface showed higher pO 2 distributions compared with the tumour surface. These results suggest that there are steep longitudinal gradients in vascular pO 2 in this tumour model that are created by the limited number and orientation of the arterioles. This contributes to tumour hypoxia. Arteriolar supply is often limited in other tumours as well, suggesting that this may represent another cause for tumour hypoxia. This report is the first direct demonstration that longitudinal oxygen gradients actually lead to hypoxia in tumours. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Carbogen {{is thought}} to be more {{effective}} than normobaric oxygen in reducing tumour hypoxia because it may reduce hyperoxic vasoconstriction. In this study, tumour and normal arteriolar diameters were measured simultaneously with perivascular pO 2 during air breathing followed by either carbogen or 100 % oxygen to determine whether the action of carbogen is the result of alterations in feeding vessel diameter. Fischer- 344 rats bearing dorsal <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chambers, with or without implanted R 3230 AC tumours, were the experimental subjects. Arteriolar diameters were measured using optical techniques and perivascular pO 2 was measured using recessed-tip electrodes (3 - 6 microns tip diameter). Baseline arteriolar pO 2 averaged 30 - 50 % of blood gas pO 2 (mean = 97 mmHg). Both hyperoxic gases increased blood gas pO 2 by 4 -to 5 -fold, but relative improvements in arteriolar pO 2 were < or = 2. 5 for all arterioles studied. This means that these normobaric high O 2 gases are not very efficient in increasing O 2 delivery to tumours. In addition, improvements in tumour arteriolar pO 2 were transient for both hyperoxic gases. Oxygen and carbogen caused no change and mild vasodilatory responses in tumour arterioles, respectively. Normal arterioles on the other hand, tended toward vasoconstriction by carbogen breathing. Peri-arteriolar pO 2 in tumours increased within the first 5 min of breathing either hyperoxic gas, followed by a decline back toward values seen with air-breathing. These results suggest that temporal changes in tumour oxygenation after exposure to carbogen or O 2 may not be due to changes in perfusion. Other factors, such as changes in O 2 consumption rate may be involved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{tracking}} algorithm to measure the velocity of fluorescently labelled red blood cells travelling through microvessels of tumours, growing in dorsal skin <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chambers, implanted on mice. Preprocessing removed noise and artefacts from the images and then segmented cells from background. The tracking algorithm is based on a 'keyhole' model that describes the probable movement of a segmented cell between contiguous frames of a video sequence. When a history of cell movement exists, past, present and a predicted landing position of the cells will define two regions of probability that resemble the shape of a keyhole. This keyhole model was used to determine if cells in contiguous frames should be linked to form tracks and also as a postprocessing tool to join split tracks and discard links that could have been formed due to noise or uncertainty. When there was no history, a circular region around the centroid of the parent cell was used as a region of probability. Outliers were removed based on the distribution of the average velocities of the tracks. Since the position and time of each cell is recorded, a wealth of statistical measures can be obtained from the tracks. The algorithm was tested on two sets of experiments. First, the vasculatures of eight tumours with different geometries were analyzed; average velocities ranged from 86 to 372 microm s(- 1), with minimum and maximum track velocities 7 and 1212 microm s(- 1), respectively. Second, a longitudinal study of velocities was performed after administering a vascular disrupting agent to two tumours and the time behaviour was analyzed over 24 h. In one of the tumours there is a complete shutdown of the vasculature whereas in the other there is a clear decrease of velocity at 30 min, with subsequent recovery by 6 h. The tracking algorithm enabled the simultaneous measurement of red blood cell velocity in multiple vessels within an intravital video sequence, enabling analysis of heterogeneity of flow and response to treatment in mouse models of cancer...|$|R
40|$|The tumor {{vascular}} {{effects of}} the tubulin destabilizing agent disodium combretastatinA- 4 3 -O-phosphate (CA- 4 -P) were investigated in the rat P 22 tumor growing in a dorsal skin <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chamber implanted into BD 9 rats. CA- 4 -P is in clinical trial as a tumor vascular targeting agent. In animal tumors, it can cause the shut-down of blood flow, leading to extensive tumor cell necrosis. However, the mechanisms leading to vascular shut-down are still unknown. Tumor vascular effects were visualized and monitored on-line {{before and after the}} administration of two doses of CA- 4 -P (30 and 100 mg/kg) using intravital microscopy. The combined effect of CA- 4 -P and systemic nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition using N(omega) -nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) was also assessed, because this combination has been shown previously to have a potentiating effect. The early effect of CA- 4 -P on tumor vascular permeability to albumin was determined to assess whether this could be involved in the mechanism of action of the drug. Tumor blood flow reduction was extremely rapid after CA- 4 -P treatment, with red cell velocity decreasing throughout the observation period and dropping to < 5 % of the starting value by 1 h. NOS inhibition alone caused a 50 % decrease in red cell velocity, and the combined treatment of CA- 4 -P and NOS inhibition was approximately additive. The mechanism of blood flow reduction was very different for NOS inhibition and CA- 4 -P. That of NOS inhibition could be explained by a decrease in vessel diameter, which was most profound on the arteriolar side of the tumor circulation. In contrast, the effects of CA- 4 -P resembled an acute inflammatory reaction resulting in a visible loss of {{a large proportion of the}} smallest blood vessels. There was some return of visible vasculature at 1 h after treatment, but the blood in these vessels was static or nearly so, and many of the vessels were distended. The hematocrit within larger draining tumor venules tended to increase at early times after CA- 4 -P, suggesting fluid loss from the blood. The stacking of red cells to form rouleaux was also a common feature, coincident with slowing of blood flow; and these two factors would lead to an increase in viscous resistance to blood flow. Tumor vascular permeability to albumin was increased to approximately 160 % of control values at 1 and 10 min after treatment. This could lead to an early decrease in tumor blood flow via an imbalance between intravascular and tissue pressures and/or an increase in blood viscosity as a result of increased hematocrit. These results suggest a mechanism of action of CA- 4 -P in vivo. Combination of CA- 4 -P with a NOS inhibitor has an additive effect, which it may be possible to exploit therapeutically...|$|R
40|$|Flightdeck Interval Management {{is one of}} the NextGen {{operational}} {{concepts that}} FAA is sponsoring to realize requisite National Airspace System (NAS) efficiencies. Interval Management will reduce variability in temporal deviations at a position, and thereby reduce buffers typically applied by controllers - resulting in higher arrival rates, and more efficient operations. Ground software generates a strategic schedule of aircraft pairs. Air Traffic Control (ATC) provides an IM clearance with the IM spacing objective (i. e., the TTF, and at which point to achieve the appropriate spacing from this aircraft) to the IM aircraft. Pilots must dial FIM speeds into the speed window on the Mode Control Panel in a timely manner, and attend to deviations between actual speed and the instantaneous FIM profile speed. Here, the crew is assumed to be operating the aircraft with autothrottles on, with autopilot engaged, and the autoflight system in Vertical Navigation (VNAV) and Lateral Navigation (LNAV); and is responsible for safely flying the aircraft while maintaining situation awareness of their ability to follow FIM speed commands and to achieve the FIM spacing goal. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether three Notification Methods and four Avionics Conditions affect pilots' performance, ratings on constructs associated with performance (workload, situation awareness), or opinions on acceptability. Three Notification Methods (alternate visual and aural alerts that notified pilots to the onset of a speed target, conformance deviation from the required speed profile, and reminded them if they failed to enter the speed within 10 seconds) were examined. These Notification Methods were: VVV (visuals for all three events), VAV (visuals for all three events, plus an aural for speed conformance deviations), and AAA (visual indications and the same aural to indicate all three of these events). Avionics Conditions were defined by the instrumentation (and location) used to present IM information to crews: (1) Integrated (IM information is embedded in extant PFD (Primary Flight Display), ND (Navigation Display), EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) displays); (2) EFB_Aft (IM information is only supplied in an EFB and mounted in location similar to that for MITRE's UPS work); (3) EFB_Fore (IM information is only supplied in an EFB which is mounted more forward, under the side window), and (4) EFB_Aft plus use of an AGD (the same IM information is supplied in an EFB and on an AGD, both mounted in locations similar to that in MITRE's UPS work). Twelve commercial pilot crews flew descent scenarios (VNAV Speed with the mode control panel (MCP) speed <b>window</b> open until <b>flaps</b> extended, then VNAV Path) in a commercial transport flight simulator with realistic visual scene and communications. The results of this study serve three practical aims: (1) contribute to the down-select of avionics configuration for future assessment of the ASTAR spacing algorithm at NASA; (2) provide information useful to the FAA Human Factors Division (ANG-C 1) 's mission to identify issues pertinent to flight certification of, and flight standards; (3) identify methodological considerations in support of future FIM human-in-the-loop (HITL) investigations...|$|R
40|$|Altered {{metabolism}} is {{a hallmark}} of almost all cancers. A tumor’s metabolic phenotype can drastically change its ability to proliferate and to survive stressors such as hypoxia or therapy. Metabolism {{can be used as}} a diagnostic marker, by differentiating neoplastic and normal tissue, and as a prognostic marker, by providing information about tumor metastatic potential. Metabolism can further be used to guide treatment selection and monitoring, as cancer treatments can influence metabolism directly by targeting a specific metabolic dysfunction or indirectly by altering upstream signaling pathways. Repeated measurement of metabolic changes during the course of treatment can therefore indicate a tumor’s response or resistance. Recently, well-supported theories indicate that the ability to modulate metabolic phenotype underpins some cancer cells’ ability to remain dormant for decades and recur with an aggressive phenotype. It follows that accurate identification and repeated monitoring of a tumor’s metabolic phenotype can bolster understanding and prediction of a tumor’s behavior from diagnosis, through treatment, and (sadly) sometimes back again. The two primary axes of metabolism are glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and alteration of either can promote unwanted outcomes in cancer. In particular, increased glucose uptake independent of oxygenation is a well-known mark of aggressive cancers that are more likely to metastasize and evade certain therapies. Lately, mitochondria are also gaining recognition as key contributors in tumor metabolism, and mitochondrial metabolism has been shown to promote metastasis in a variety of cell types. Most tumor types rely on a combination of both aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, but the two axes’ relative contributions to ATP production can vary wildly. Knowledge of both glycolytic and mitochondrial endpoints is required for actionable, systems-level understanding of tumor metabolic preference. Several technologies exist that can measure endpoints informing on glycolytic and/or mitochondrial metabolism. However, these technologies suffer from a combination of prohibitive cost, low resolution, and lack of repeatability due to destructive sample treatments. There is a critical need to bridge the gap in pre-clinical studies between single-endpoint whole body imaging and destructive ex vivo assays that provide multiple metabolic properties, neither of which can provide adequate spatiotemporal information for repeated tumor monitoring. Optical technologies are well-suited to non-destructive, high resolution imaging of tumor metabolism. A carefully chosen set of endpoints can be measured across a variety of length scales and resolutions to obtain a complete picture of a tumor’s metabolic state. First, the fluorescent glucose analog 2 -(N-(7 -Nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) Amino) - 2 -Deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG) can be used to report on glucose uptake. The fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) reports on mitochondrial membrane potential, which provides information regarding capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. Vascular oxygenation (SO 2) and morphological features, which are critical for interpretation of 2 -NBDG and TMRE uptake, can be obtained using only endogenous contrast from hemoglobin. Three specific aims were proposed toward the ultimate goal of developing an optical imaging toolbox that utilizes exogenous fluorescence and endogenous absorption contrast to characterize cancer metabolic phenotype in vivo. In Aim 1, we optimized the fluorescent glucose analog 2 -(N-(7 -Nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) Amino) - 2 -Deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG) to report on glycolytic demand in vivo. Our primary goal was to demonstrate that correcting 2 -NBDG uptake (NBDG 60) by the rate of delivery (RD) showed improved contrast between distinct tumor phenotypes. We showed that the ratio 2 -NBDG 60 /RD served as a delivery-corrected measure of glucose uptake in the dorsal skin <b>flap</b> <b>window</b> chamber models containing normal tissues and tumors. Delivery correction was able to minimize the effects of a large change in the injected 2 -NBDG dose. Further, the endpoint showed a significant inverse correlation with blood glucose levels. Since glucose has been shown to competitively inhibit 2 -NBDG transport into cells, this finding indicating that we were indeed reporting on glucose uptake. Importantly, the ratio was able to distinguish specific uptake of 2 -NBDG from accumulation of a fluorescent control, 2 -NBDLG, which is identical to 2 -NBDG in molecular weight and fluorescent spectrum, but is unable to undergo active transport into the cell. The ratio 2 -NBDG 60 /RD was then leveraged to compare different tumor phenotypes and to characterize the dependence of glucose uptake on vascular oxygenation within these tumors. Our results showed that 2 -NBDG 60 /RD was an effective endpoint for comparing in vivo glucose uptake of metastatic 4 T 1 and nonmetastatic 4 T 07 murine mammary adenocarcinomas. Further, the addition of vascular information revealed metabolic heterogeneity within the tumors. The primary conclusion of Aim 1 was that delivery-corrected 2 -NBDG uptake (2 -NBDG 60 /RD) is an appropriate indicator of glucose demand in both normal and tumor tissues. In Aim 2, we optimized fluorescent tetramethyl rhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) for measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). We then leveraged the relationships between MMP, glucose uptake, and vascular endpoints to characterize the in vivo metabolic landscapes of three distinct and extensively studied murine breast cancer lines: metastatic 4 T 1 and non-metastatic 67 NR and 4 T 07. Using two-photon microscopy, we confirmed that TMRE localizes to mitochondrial-sized features in the window chamber when delivered via tail vein. The kinetics of TMRE uptake were robust across both normal and tumor tissues, with a stable temporal window for measurement from 40 - 75 minutes after injection. We saw that TMRE uptake decreased as expected in response to hypoxia in non-tumor tissue, and in response to chemical inhibition with a mitochondrial uncoupler in both non-tumor and 4 T 1 tissue. MMP was increased in all tumor types relative to non-tumor (p We leveraged the relationships between the now-optimized endpoints of MMP (Aim 2), glucose uptake (Aim 1) and vascular endpoints (Aims 1 and 2) to characterize the in vivo metabolic landscapes of three distinct and extensively studied murine breast cancer lines: metastatic 4 T 1 and non-metastatic 67 NR and 4 T 07. Imaging the combination of endpoints revealed a classic “Warburg effect” coupled with hyperpolarized mitochondria in 4 T 1; 4 T 1 maintained vastly increased glucose uptake and comparable MMP relative to 4 T 07 or 67 NR across all SO 2. We also showed that imaging trends were concordant with independent metabolomics analysis, though the lack of spatial and vascular data from metabolomics obscured a more detailed comparison of the technologies. We observed that vascular features in tumor peritumoral areas (PA) were equally or more aberrant than vessels in the tumor regions that they neighbored. This prompted consideration of the metabolic phenotype of the PA. Regional metabolic cooperation between the tumor region and the PA was seen only in 4 T 1, where MMP was greater in 4 T 1 tumors and glucose uptake was greater in 4 T 1 PAs. Because of their regional metabolic coupling as well as their demonstrated capacity for glycolysis and mitochondrial activity, we hypothesized that the 4 T 1 tumors would have an increased ability to maintain robust MMP during hypoxia. 67 NR and 4 T 07 tumors showed expected shifts toward decreased MMP and increased glucose uptake during hypoxia, similar to the trends we observed in normal tissue. Surprisingly, 4 T 1 tumors appeared to increase mitochondrial metabolism during hypoxia, since MMP increased and SO 2 dramatically decreased. Overall, this aim demonstrated two key findings: 1. TMRE is a suitable marker of mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo in normal tissue and tumors, and 2. imaging of multiple metabolic and vascular endpoints is crucial for the appropriate interpretation of a metabolic behavior. Finally, in Aim 3 we evaluated the feasibility of combined 2 -NBDG and TMRE imaging. The primary objective was to enable simultaneous imaging of the two fluorophores by minimizing sources of “cross-talk”: chemical reaction, optical overlap, and confounding biological effects. A secondary objective was to transition our imaging method to a new platform, a reflectance-mode, high-resolution fluorescence imaging system built in our lab, which would expand the use of our technique beyond the dorsal window chamber model. We first used liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry to confirm that the chemical properties of the two fluorophores were compatible for simultaneous use, and indeed saw that the mixing of equimolar 2 -NBDG and TMRE did not form any new chemical species. We also performed a phantom study on the hyperspectral imaging system, used for all animal imaging in Aim 1 and Aim 2, to estimate the range of 2 -NBDG and TMRE concentrations that are seen at the tissue level in normal and tumor window chambers. We created a new phantom set that spanned the range of estimated in vivo concentrations, and imaged them with the reflectance-mode fluorescence imaging system. The phantom experiments gave us two important findings. First, we saw that fluorescence intensity increased linearly with fluorophore concentration, allowing for accurate quantification of concentration changes between samples. Most importantly, we found that we could exploit the optical properties of the fluorophores and our system’s spectral detection capability to excite the two fluorophores independently. Specifically, we could excite 2 -NBDG with a 488 nm laser without detectable emission from TMRE, and could excite TMRE with a 555 nm laser without detectable emission from 2 -NBDG. With this characterization, the optical properties of the two fluorophores were considered compatible for simultaneous imaging. Next, we sought to determine whether biological or delivery interactions would affect uptake of the two fluorophores. Surprisingly, both in vitro and in vivo imaging suggested that simultaneous dosing of the 2 -NBDG and TMRE caused significant changes in uptake of both probes. Since we previously found that TMRE equilibrates rapidly at the tissue site, we hypothesized that staggering the injections to allow delivery of TMRE to tissue before injecting 2 -NBDG would restore the full uptake of both fluorophores. Two sequential injection protocols were used: in the first group, TMRE was injected first followed by injection of 2 -NBDG after only 1 - 5 minutes, and in the second group, TMRE was injected first followed by injection of 2 -NBDG after 10 - 15 minutes. Both sequential injection strategies were sufficient to restore the final fluorescence of both fluorophores to that seen in the separate TMRE or 2 -NBDG imaging cohorts; however, the shorter time delay caused changes to the initial delivery kinetics of 2 -NBDG. We concluded that sequential imaging of TMRE followed by 2 -NBDG with a 10 - 15 minute delay was therefore the optimal imaging strategy to enable simultaneous quantification of glucose uptake and mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo. Applying the sequential imaging protocol to 4 T 1 tumors demonstrated a highly glycolytic phenotype compared to the normal animals, as we had seen in Aim 2. However, mitochondrial membrane potential was comparable for the normal and tumor groups. The next study will test an extended delay between the injections to allow more time for TMRE delivery to tumors prior to 2 -NBDG injection. Overall, the key finding of Aim 3 was that a carefully chosen delivery strategy for 2 -NBDG and TMRE enabled simultaneous imaging of the two endpoints, since chemical and optical cross-talk were negligible. The work presented here indicates that an optical toolbox of 2 -NBDG, TMRE, and vascular endpoints is well poised to reveal interesting and distinct metabolic phenomena in normal tissue and tumors. Future work will focus on the integration of optical spectroscopy with the microscopy toolbox presented here, to enable long-term studies of the unknown metabolic changes underlying a tumor’s response to therapy, its escape into dormancy, and ultimately, its recurrence.
