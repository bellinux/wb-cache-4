40|$|Wind {{power has}} a strong {{position}} at the Danish electricity market, mainly caused by high feed-in tariffs in the 1990 s. Investments in new <b>wind-power</b> <b>installations</b> on land, however, have declined dramatically after the Danish electricity market was liberalised in 1999. First, the paper describes how policy measures directed towards wind power have been redesigned to match the liberalised market. Then, we estimate {{the impact of the}} redesigned tariffs on the electricity prices. Finally, we assess whether the new tariffs make an incentive to invest in wind power. The paper concludes that the new tariffs not by itself make evidence for the actual Danish recession in new <b>wind-power</b> <b>installations</b> after the electricity reform. The main causes could include a combination of problems in spatial planning, high risk aversion of new wind turbine investors and perhaps more favourable support schemes in other countries.

Power is being sold to NSTAR under a power purchase agreement, and will go to the Boston area.|$|R
40|$|The article studies {{functioning}} of the scheme of transformation power through the converter <b>wind-power</b> <b>installations</b> during emergency operation. The main types of emergencies for this converter are considered. An approach to the calculation of short-circuit current of a synchronous generator and short-circuit current of an LC-circuit is presented. Protection elements (voltage limiters, fuses, fast current sensors) are given for circuit protection and the reliability in emergency conditions is offered. Unlike classic circuit diagrams for <b>wind-power</b> <b>installations,</b> the circuit diagrams without multiplying gear for turbo-generator wind-рower installations have a self-stabilization effect of electromechanical system under optimal conditions {{in a wide range}} of a wind flow. In order to improve its effectiveness and implement an offline mode, you need to use converters to match the frequency of the generator voltage and that the frequency of network. Circuit diagrams of such converters have a complex structure, they contain a number of power supplies and rectifiers, capacitive storages, pulse converters and multi-level inverters...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{amounts of}} wind power connected, the power system is impacted {{in a number of}} ways. In this paper, the emphasis has been on one of those impacts: the harmonic emission from <b>wind-power</b> <b>installations.</b> The harmonic emission of individual wind turbines as well as from a wind park has been studied. For four modern wind turbines estimations have been done on the impact on the grid per harmonic and interharmonic group. The primary emission from complete windpark due to the emission from the turbines has been analyzed. Godkänd; 2013; 20130905 (kaiyan...|$|R
50|$|Granite Reliable Wind Farm is a 99-megawatt wind farm, {{opened in}} 2011 in Millsfield and Dixville, New Hampshire, in the {{northeast}} United States. Owned by Brookfield Renewable, {{it is the second}} major <b>wind-power</b> <b>installation</b> in the state of New Hampshire. Most of the electricity generated will be sold to utilities in Vermont, Central Vermont Public Service and Green Mountain Power. Power from the wind turbines is connected through three 34.5 kV lines to a substation and from there through a 115 kV line. The wind farm was constructed by Madison, Wisconsin-based RMT Inc.|$|R

This work inspired a series of two-dimensional and <b>installation</b> <b>works</b> made with hair. In 1967, he created a huge <b>installation</b> <b>work</b> that was made from Lee's accidental experiment, which occurred when he went to a military camp near the DMZ to draw a portrait for a division commander. He obtained bags full of hair of new recruits and used them to create the <b>installation</b> <b>work</b> in a then-newly-built church.|$|R
