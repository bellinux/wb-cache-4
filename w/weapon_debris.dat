50|$|An explosion, {{whether or}} not by a <b>weapon,</b> causes the <b>debris</b> to act as {{multiple}} high velocity projectiles. An explosive weapon, or device may also be designed to produce many high velocity projectiles by the break-up of its casing, these are correctly termed fragments.|$|R
40|$|With {{the absence}} of nuclear weapons testing {{there has been an}} {{increase}} in the reliance on simulation and modeling for the analysis of nuclear weapons effects. The principal objective of this dissertation was to develop a particle code for modeling the spatial distribution and temporal decay of ionized fission fragments and beta-decay electrons injected into the magnetic field of the earth. No known code existed for this explicit purpose. The code provides a robust, realistic computational capability to predict the persistent radiation environment produced for such an injection (most likely due to a nuclear detonation at high altitudes) into L-shells less than 1. 5. The code {{can also be used to}} produce a source term for the <b>weapons</b> <b>debris</b> from a nuclear detonation at any high altitude location. Using the model, several of the free parameters are examined and reported to highlight the sensitivity of the persistent environment to the initial conditions fission fragment release. The parameters examined and reported here include the effects of ion release location (longitude, latitude, and altitude), the charge state of the fission fragments, the beta decay half-life, the initial pitch angle of the fission fragments, and the significance of neutral fission fragments. Additionally, the effects of the magnetic bubble on the dispersion and trapping efficiency of the particles is studied and reported...|$|R

2500|$|The {{heat and}} {{airborne}} debris {{created by a}} nuclear explosion can cause rain; debris is thought to do this by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. During the city firestorm which followed the Hiroshima explosion, drops of water were recorded to have been {{about the size of}} marbles. This was termed black rain, and has served as the source of a book and film by the same name. Black rain is not unusual following large fires, and is commonly produced by pyrocumulus clouds during large forest fires. The rain directly over Hiroshima on that day is said to have begun around 9 a.m. with it covering a wide area from the hypocenter to the north-west, raining heavily for one hour or more in some areas. The rain directly over the city may have carried neutron activated building material combustion products, but it did not carry any appreciable nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>debris</b> or fallout, although this is generally to the contrary to what other less technical sources state. The [...] "oily" [...] black soot particles, are a characteristic of incomplete combustion in the city firestorm.|$|E

In order to do that, you must retrieve Hestu's maracas from a group of Bokoblins in the Lanayru or Necluda region. Once that is done, he will retreat to Korok Forest, location of the Great Deku Tree and the Master Sword. Curiously, the Kokiri are absent in the game.|$|R
40|$|Archaeologists {{have long}} studied hunting {{strategies}} and weapons {{technology of the}} Paleoindian period of North America, dating to {{the close of the}} Pleistocene more than 10, 000 years ago. Less well understood are women’s activities, the toolkits they used, and how gendered activities can be recognized in the archaeological record. I use a number of lines of inquiry, including ethnographic review, cross-cultural analysis, and archaeological investigation, to address these questions. Because the Paleoindian record consists largely of flaked stone, investigating gendered activities is challenging, particularly if women did not use stone tools to any great extent. Examination of the historic and ethnographic literature reveals women’s participation in all aspects of technological organization, including quarrying, transport, manufacture, use, and maintenance. Especially prominent among women’s toolkits are stone hide-working tools. Similar tools, called endscrapers, occur in the Paleoindian record, suggesting that these may have been used by women. To further examine the possibility of women’s contributions to the Paleoindian record, I conducted cross-cultural analyses, which indicate that high reliance on hunting and increasing latitude results in a division of labor in which women do {{the vast majority of the}} hide processing. Employing embodied capital theory (Kaplan et al. 2000), I argue that tasks requiring both in-depth knowledge and complex perceptual motor skills, such as hide-working, take many years to master and are often divided along gender lines beginning in early childhood. Finally, I use the Rio Rancho Folsom site in the Central Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico as a case study to investigate Paleoindian gendered activities. Spatial distribution of Folsom-age endscrapers and weaponry from the Rio Rancho Folsom site indicate that endscrapers and <b>weapons</b> <b>debris</b> were distributed differently, though they also overlapped to a degree. The spatial distributions of weapons and endscrapers suggest that most endscrapers were not associated with weapons production. Raw material allocation for weapons and endscrapers differs to some degree, but there are overall similarities in the makeup of these assemblages in terms of local and non-local materials. The allocation of raw material to endscrapers does not appear to have been expedient, but rather planned for in anticipation of use at the site. Further, the production of endscrapers does not appear to have been a byproduct of weapons production, but rather a separate strategy to produce a particular form. Overall, multiple lines of evidence are suggestive of women’s hide-working in the Paleoindian record, and point to the possibility of endscrapers as a component of women’s hide-working toolkits.

50|$|After Fallout 4s release, Bethesda has {{released}} several patches {{to address some}} of the issues that were present at the game's launch along with presenting features that improve general gameplay. The first patch—coded as patch 1.2—fine-tuned the game by improving the frame rate. Patch 1.2 also fixed a few bugs and errors present at the launch of the game but interfered with unofficial mod support. Patch 1.3 improved the game's graphics on all platforms, along with presenting the game with new features such as an added status menu for settlers in settlements. With regard to the graphical updates introduced in this patch, the PC platform was given a new <b>weapon</b> <b>debris</b> effect and a new ambient occlusion setting. The patch also fixed several bugs and glitches present in the game. Patch 1.4 was designed to ready the game for the upcoming Creation Kit and downloadable content. Patch 1.4 also brought a variety of additions to the settlement building mechanic of the game by adding symbol to new content placed in by the modding community along with adding a variety of items, such as Raider and Super Mutant decors. The patch also brought general improvements to the game's stability. The 1.5 patch added a revamped survival mode along with support for the downloadable content. The patch also brought bug fixes. Similar to the previous Bethesda games, Fallout 4s fan community created unofficial patches to address issues and bugs unaddressed by the official patches.|$|E
