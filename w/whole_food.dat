500|$|The {{breeding}} behaviour of the melampittas is only known in any detail for the lesser melampitta. All {{that is known}} of the breeding of the greater melampitta are reports from local people that it creates nests that are baskets of vines suspended in the limestone sinkholes that it roosts in. There is also some evidence {{that it may be}} territorial. The lesser melampitta is known to start nesting in the dry season and continue into the beginning of the wet. The nest is a closed dome shape constructed out of live green moss. The nest that has been described was found [...] from the ground {{on the side of a}} tree fern, with nesting material woven into the bark and attached to dead fronds of the tree fern to secure it. The female lays a single chalky white and slightly speckled egg, which measures , and undertakes all the incubation duties. The incubation is quite long for a small passerine, lasting around 27 days, during which the male will feed the female. Both sexes feed the single chick, which is hatched covered in downy feathers. Unlike their relatives in the birds of paradise family, which feed their chicks by regurgitation, the parents feed the chick <b>whole</b> <b>food</b> that has not been swallowed. The chick takes up to 35 days to fledge, a long time for passerines.|$|E

2500|$|Nutritionists often {{refer to}} {{carbohydrates}} as either simple or complex. However, the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous.

However, the report put [...] "fruit, vegetables and whole-grains" [...] in the complex carbohydrate column, despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides.

60|$|Whatever superstitions {{the sperm}} whalemen in general have {{connected}} with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one {{and all of them}} declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his <b>whole</b> <b>food</b> in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.|$|E
