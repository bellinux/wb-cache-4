The collaboration is conducting a ten-year, basin-scale <b>monitoring</b> <b>project</b> of salmonid habitat restoration projects in the Middle Fork John Day (MFJD) River basin in Eastern Oregon. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>project</b> is known as an intensively monitored watershed (IMW), one of sixteen throughout the Pacific Northwest. The research is guided by the following question: How do leadership dynamics in the MFJD IMW collaborative governance structure facilitate effective collaborative process or create limitations to that process? This study uses qualitative research methods in evaluating multiple research sources. Insights from this study may prove valuable in providing guidance on effectively structuring and managing basin-scale collaborative habitat <b>monitoring</b> <b>projects,</b> including future IMW projects. This study further aims to contribute to research on collaborative leadership for the greater scholarship on collaboration...|$|R
