2500|$|At {{the onset}} of a thunderstorm, {{according}} to Nikola's own description, he felt a great excitement; he heard some music in the thunder, all his muscles tightened, and something made him go. He would take a sickle and a scythe, a warp beam on which a twin sister had wound <b>warp</b> <b>yarns,</b> the bag with the last-year's pellets, and the bottle with last-year's dew. With this he would run directly toward the cloud, looking neither left nor right, nor watching where he treads. Once on the field, Nikola would stick the scythe into the ground, and say a prayer for lightning to strike. Having gone away from the scythe, he would make {{the sign of the}} cross with the warp beam in the direction of the cloud, to break it into quarters. Further beneath it, he would shake the cloud apart using the pellets and dew. There he also addressed the souls of the drowned and hanged leading the cloud, praying them that the [...] "rain like this dew" [...] fall, and spoke various other prayers. For these protective services, Nikola had been receiving wheat and maize from his fellow villagers. He was eventually warned by the authorities to stop with these activities, branded backward superstition by them.|$|E

(2007) {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the ratio of the force applied on the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> by the whip roller to the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> tension, and the vertical and horizontal position of the whip roller with variations in warp beam radius during the weaving process. Adanur and Qi (2008 a) established an on-line tension measurement system by producing denim fabric on an air-jet loom in order to evaluate yarn tensions. Adanur and Qi (2008 b) studied the effects of tension on the properties of denim fabrics made on an air-jet weaving loom. The variations in <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> tension during the weaving process become smaller by the backrest rollerâ€™s swinging motion. At a high speed of the weaving machine, it could be possible to obtain a suitable relationship between movements of the whip roller and <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> tension (Kloppels et al. 2002).|$|R

50|$|There are two {{different}} fiber yarns that are woven {{together to form a}} hose jacket. The yarns that run lengthwise down the hose are called <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> and are usually made from spun polyester or filament nylon. They form the inner and outer surfaces of the jacket and provide abrasion resistance for the hose. The yarns that are wound in a tight spiral around the circumference of the hose are called the filler yarns and are made from filament polyester. They are trapped between the crisscrossing <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> and provide strength to resist the internal water pressure. The spun polyester <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> are specially prepared by a yarn manufacturer and are shipped to the hose plant. No further preparation is needed.|$|E

If inserted {{from both sides of the}} <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> layers, the weft yarns may be inserted simultaneously or alternately from each side of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> layers. The vertical yarn is then inserted into the fabric by reciprocation of a plurality of harnesses which separate the vertical yarn into a plurality of vertical yarn systems as required by the shape of the three-dimensional fabric being formed...|$|R
40|$|Fabric {{properties}} such as pilling and {{abrasion resistance}} and tensile strength vary when greige fabric is processed further. The quality of dyed fabric {{depends on the}} quality of greige fabric. Cotton Plain and Twill weave fabrics were woven at three different <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> tension and then dyed using monochlorotriazine, Drimerene Red Cl- 5 B dye gives difference in fabric properties. The ASTM, American International Standards were used to determine the greige and dyed fabric properties. It has been observed fabric woven at proper loom setting or <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> tension have high strength, less pilling and abrasion tendency as compared to fabric woven at variant <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> tension. Moreover, fabric tenacity is decreased after dyeing whereas, slight difference in pilling and abrasion values is observed after dyeing than that of greige fabric...|$|R

50|$|Leno weave (also called Gauze weave or Cross weave) is a weave {{in which}} two <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> are twisted around the weft yarns to provide a strong yet sheer fabric. The {{standard}} warp yarn is paired with a skeleton or 'doup' yarn; these twisted <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> grip tightly to the weft which causes the durability of the fabric. Leno weave produces an open fabric with almost no yarn slippage or misplacement of threads.|$|E
5000|$|Shedding. Shedding is {{the raising}} of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> to form a loop through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted. The shed is the {{vertical}} space between the raised and unraised <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or heald frame, {{also known as a}} harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which <b>warp</b> <b>yarns,</b> and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are dobbies and a Jacquard Head.|$|E
50|$|The sheen and softer feel of sateen is {{produced}} through the satin weave structure. <b>Warp</b> <b>yarns</b> are floated over weft yarns, for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or sateen, the weft yarns are floated over the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.)</b> Standard plain weaves use a one-over, one-under structure. The long floats produce a surface that is smooth {{to the touch}} and reduces light scattering to increase shine. This weave structure is more susceptible to wear than other weaves.|$|E

The output signals of MEMS sensors, which were mounted on harness cords of a Jacquard machine, {{at the moment of}} <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> break and after the break for a broad range of basic weaves were acquired during weaving. The weaves investigated are commonly used in Jacquard weaving to form patterns. The strength of the MEMS output acceleration signals was analyzed in time domain. The results show that the system is capable of detecting <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> breaks for the broad range of weaves studied...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the loom}} starts, the filler bobbins wind the filler yarn {{in a circle}} through the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> As soon as the bobbins pass, the loom crisscrosses each pair of {{adjacent}} <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> to trap the filler yarn between them. This weaving process continues at a high speed as {{the lower end of}} the jacket is slowly drawn down through the loom, and the bobbins continue to wrap the filler yarns around the circumference of the jacket in a tight spiral. The woven jacket is wound flat on a take-up reel.|$|E

5000|$|... 8-harness {{satin weave}} (8HS), {{in which the}} fill yarn passes over seven <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> and then under one warp yarn, is the most pliable satin weave and forms most easily around {{compound}} curves.|$|E
5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|E

50|$|In Medieval England, double weaves called {{compound}} weft-faced twills featured weft or filling yarns {{in multiple}} colors, {{with the design}} completely covering the face <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> and the unused colors for any particular section woven into a binding warp on the reverse side.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} twist in a yarn helps {{to define the}} style of yarn- a yarn {{with a lot of}} air such as a woollen yarn will have much less twist than a yarn with little air, like a worsted yarn. It also affects the stretchiness of the yarn, {{strength}}, the halo of the yarn, and many other attributes. Filling or weft yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with <b>warp</b> <b>yarns,</b> and highly twisted yarns are, in general, stronger. <b>Warp</b> <b>yarns</b> have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. Filament fibers, such as silk, or many synthetics, need only to be twisted slightly to create a yarn.|$|E
5000|$|Weaving {{can be done}} in a {{conventional}} manner to produce two-dimensional fibres as well in a multilayer weaving that can create three-dimensional fibres. However, multilayer weaving is required to have multiple layers of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> to create fibres in the z- direction creating a few disadvantages in manufacturing,namely the time to set up all the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> on the loom. Therefore, most multilayer weaving is currently used to produce relatively narrow width products, or high value products where the cost of the preform production is acceptable. Another one of the main problems facing the use of multilayer woven fabrics is the difficulty in producing a fabric that contains fibres oriented with angles other than 0" [...] and 90" [...] to each other respectively.|$|E
