5|$|We {{probably}} have more influences than {{we know what}} to do with. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E

25|$|To sum up, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> {{notions of}} weight of which weight1 is dominant. Yet 'weightlessness' is {{typically}} exemplified not by absence of weight1 {{but by the}} absence of stress associated with weight2. This is the intended sense of weightlessness in what follows below.|$|E

60|$|Sam and I always argue {{a little}} about the exact spot where a fish has broken water. I never missed it far, but Sam seldom missed it at all. He could tell by a slight foam always left by the break. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> baits out, as one or another of my companions always holds a rod. The more baits out the better! <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> vicious, smashing strikes at the same time. The fish on the other rod let go just as I hooked mine.|$|R

25|$|The flag {{consists}} of three (3) horizontal stripes; the superior one green, the center white and the bottom one yellow. A fourth cross. In {{the center of that}} cross <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> arms united with a ripe yellow pineapple. The cross is surrounded by eleven gold stars; five in the superior (north) part and six in the inferior (south) part of the cross forming a circle.|$|E
25|$|Thinking of the N-V− {{center as}} a multielectronic system, we can draw the diagram {{in the figure}} at right, where the states are labeled {{according}} to their symmetry and with a left superscript that indicates with a 3 {{if it is a}} triplet (S=1) and with a 1 if it is a singlet (S=0). It is well accepted today that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> triplet states and two intermediate singlet states.|$|E
25|$|In , <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> examples: Yomiel, the {{original}} bad guy, {{who was a}} man that was neither alive nor dead, as his body constantly regenerated because {{of the power of}} a meteorite that entered his back and lodged in his heart; and Sissel which becomes a more literal example after going 10 years in the past to save his master Yomiel from such fate, but in turn the meteorite lodged inside the black cat himself, allowing him to be both dead and alive.|$|E

25|$|Even {{the name}} Gentius or Genthius {{does not help}} {{to solve the problem}} since <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> Illyrian forms Genthius and Zanatis. If Gentius or Genthius derives from *ǵen- (be born) this is proof of a Centum language, but if the name Zanatis is {{similarly}} generated (or from *ǵen- know) than we have a Satem language. Another problem related to the name Gentius is that nowadays it cannot be stated surely if the initial /g/ of the sources was a palatovelar or a labiovelar.|$|E
25|$|Not {{one of his}} librettists {{managed to}} produce a {{libretto}} on the same artistic level as Rameau's music: the plots were often overly complex or unconvincing. But this was standard for the genre, and is probably part of its charm. The versification, too, was mediocre, and Rameau often {{had to have the}} libretto modified and rewrite the music after the premiere because of the ensuing criticism. This is why <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> versions of Castor et Pollux (1737 and 1754) and three of Dardanus (1739, 1744, and 1760).|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} samples t-test is used when two separate sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, one {{from each of}} the two populations being compared. For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50subjects to the treatment group and 50subjects to the control group. In this case, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> {{independent samples}} and would use the unpaired form of the t-test. The randomization is not essential here – if we contacted 100people by phone and obtained each person's age and gender, and then used a two-sample t-test to see whether the mean ages differ by gender, this would also be an independent samples t-test, even though the data are observational.|$|E

25|$|For example, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> {{patients}} who are taking codeine for pain relief. Codeine is a prodrug, so it requires conversion from its inactive form to its active form. The active form of codeine is morphine, which provides the therapeutic effect of pain relief. If person A receives one *1 allele each from mother and father to code for the CYP2D6 gene, then that person is considered to have an extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype, as allele *1 is considered to have a normal-function (this would be represented as CYP2D6 *1/*1). If person B {{on the other hand}} had received one *1 allele from the mother and a *4 allele from the father, that individual would be an Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) (the genotype would be CYP2D6 *1/*4). Although both individuals are taking the same dose of codeine, person B could potentially lack the therapeutic benefits of codeine due to the decreased conversion rate of codeine to its active counterpart morphine.|$|E

500|$|On 1 November, Benfica hosted Celtic; {{they scored}} two {{goals in the}} first 25 minutes and a third through Andrei Karyaka in the 90th minute, winning by the same margin they had lost in Glasgow. Santos was happy with the win, saying, [...] "We knew he had three 'finals' and now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two.</b> We are better now, with four points and closing in on Celtic." [...] Four days later, Benfica hosted [...] Beira-Mar for a Primeira Liga match. Benfica did not score until the second half, when in the 51st minute, Katsouranis headed in the match's first goal. Three minutes later, Petit scored the second and an own-goal from Beira-Mar made the score 3–0.|$|E

500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson heralded {{the return}} of the series, declaring [...] "Fringe comes {{crashing}} headlong back onto television. That's not just a metaphor. Before we even fade in <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> cars smashing into each other. What a way to return: an accident in which one driver is nowhere to be found and the other flees into a nearby apartment, smooches his face and then uses a strange device to rearrange his appearance. That's my good old Fringe." [...] The Futon Critic rated [...] "A New Day in the Old Town" [...] the sixteenth best television episode of 2010, while website blogger io9 listed it as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
500|$|Given {{submitted}} a written transfer request in December 2000, {{after failing to}} regain {{his place in the}} first team from Steve Harper after a thigh injury had ruled him out of a match against Leeds United. Manager Sir Bobby Robson stated at the time: [...] "A lot of clubs have a very good goalkeeper and one who stands by. I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> keepers — and Harper is proving that — who can play in the Premiership". The club rejected Given's request, which was then withdrawn by the goalkeeper, who later stated that his [...] "intention was simply to express [...] frustration at being left out of the team," [...] and that he [...] "never had any intention of actually leaving the club." [...] An injury to Harper led to Given being recalled to the first team, and he kept his place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
