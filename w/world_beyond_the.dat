5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves {{got a sense of}} belonging to a <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the <b>world.</b> <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E

When the Titans invade his town, he is powerless to save her from being devoured by one of the Titans, and vows to kill every Titan henceforth. Enlisting in the military, Eren eventually places fifth overall in his graduating class. Parts of Eren's past are revealed through the series. Following Shingashina's fall, he has a brief encounter with his father Grisha who entrusts him with a key to the basement of their house, and who injects him with a mysterious liquid. When he was nine years old, he and his father were planning to meet Mikasa Ackerman and her family, but they discover that her parents have been killed and that she is held hostage. He kills two of the captors and convinces Mikasa to kill the third as he is being strangled by the latter.|$|E
500|$|A common {{belief in}} Europe {{during this period}} was the Aristotelian idea that the <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Moon and planets was immutable. So {{observers}} argued that the phenomenon {{was something in the}} Earth's atmosphere. However Tycho noted that the object remained stationary from night to night—never changing its parallax—so it must lie far away. He published his observations in the small book De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa stella (Latin for [...] "Concerning the new and previously unseen star") in 1573. It is from the title of this book that the modern word nova for cataclysmic variable stars is derived.|$|E

In the world below, they discover a warlock named Xande, one of three apprentices to the legendary Archmage Noah, is trying to possess the crystals of light, so as to bring forth chaos and disorder. The four warriors eventually arrive at the Crystal Tower where they discover that the Cloud of Darkness {{is the source of}} the recent events. The Cloud attempts to create a similar situation to the Flood of Light a millennia earlier so that the world is pulled into the void. The Light Warriors traverse into the domain of the dark crystals to free the imprisoned Dark Warriors and defeat the Cloud of Darkness, thereby restoring the crystals and balance to the world. In the DS remake, there are also several [...] "side quests" [...] that can also be completed.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Brockmann argues {{the fact}} that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because [...] "there is no access to a natural <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> realm of the {{tortured}} human psyche". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect {{the chaos of the}} film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they {{are the only ones who}} truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} she {{had been}} cast, Reed hired a personal trainer and practiced a healthier diet to prepare herself for her revealing costumes in which she exposes her midriff as the character. In the musical, Jasmine resembles an even stronger, more spirited character than the film version, specifically {{the way in which}} she fights against marriage laws and men who wish to control her. Reed believes her character changed the most during workshops as the show traveled from Seattle to Toronto, and finally Broadway, including the replacement of an original musical number with [...] "These Palace Walls", which composer Alan Menken wrote specifically for Reed. Described by Reed as [...] "a really beautiful song" [...] that [...] "sets up her character", [...] "These Palace Walls" [...] narrates Jasmine's desire to explore the <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> confines of the palace, despite being grateful for everything her father has already provided her with. Reed originally found performing [...] "A Whole New World" [...] particularly daunting because, as the film's most famous song, [...] "everyone has these very specific ideas of what they think it should look like or sound like", in addition to feeling pressured to match Salonga's performance, of whom she is a fan.|$|E
500|$|Alexei Panshin and Cory Panshin {{wrote in}} The <b>World</b> <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> Hill: Science Fiction and the Quest for Transcendence (1989), [...] "Typewriter in the Sky can be {{understood}} as an old-fashioned alien exploration story, with a new basis of transfer from one world to another– the thoughts of an outside intelligence." [...] Writing in a 1992 article for the journal Science Fiction Studies, David N. Samuelson pointed out that the literary conceit of [...] "assuming human beings are necessary for the universe we know" [...] predated Typewriter in the Sky as well as What Mad Universe (1949) by Fredric Brown. Authors Lionel Fanthorpe and Patricia Fanthorpe wrote in The World's Most Mysterious People (1998) that Hubbard accomplished a difficult task of writing about two different worlds at the same time, [...] "even through the medium of fiction Hubbard succeeds in posing deep metaphysical questions about the mind's interpretation of experiential data, and its response to the questions about the nature of being." [...] Writing in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1999), John Clute and John Grant characterized the work as the best of Hubbard's stories in the Arabian-fantasy theme. In their book Mysteries and Secrets of Time (2007), Fanthorpe and Fanthorpe place the book within the sub-topic of [...] "the idea of being caught inside someone else's dream". In his 2011 book The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick, author Umberto Rossi analyzed Hubbard's story and called it a parody intended to spoof the experiences of hack writers.|$|E

This too, he relates to cricket. James returns to the values imbued with cricket, first into the 19th-century English bourgeois culture of the British public school, and then out into the colonies.
