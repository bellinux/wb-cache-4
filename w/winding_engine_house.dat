25|$|Dominating the {{colliery}} site are {{the above}} ground structures {{of a deep}} (i.e. vertical shaft) mine - the brick built <b>Winding</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>House,</b> and the red painted wooden Heapstead. These were relocated to the museum (which never had its own vertical shaft), the winding house coming from Beamish Chophill Colliery, and the Heapstead from Ravensworth Park Mine in Gateshead. The winding engine and its enclosing house are both listed.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum was}} opened to {{visitors}} on its current {{site for the}} first time in 1972, with the first translocated buildings (the railway station and colliery winding engine) being erected the following year. The first trams began operating on a short demonstration line in 1973. The Town station was formally opened in 1976, the same year the reconstruction of the colliery <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> was completed, and the miner's cottages were relocated. Opening of the drift mine as an exhibit followed in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|The {{colliery}} {{closed in}} 1989, and in 1990 the <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>houses,</b> generating station and water-treatment works, {{as well as}} the A frame, were given listed building status, as category B listed structures.|$|R
50|$|At 6.30 in {{the morning}} the miners started work. They were lowered down the shaft in a cage (by the head frame). These cages were also used to bring up coal as it was mined. A <b>Winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>housed</b> in a brick {{building}} would operate the cage.|$|R
5000|$|Woodhorn, officially Woodhorn Museum and Northumberland Archives and {{formerly}} known as Woodhorn Colliery Museum, is located in Ashington, Northumberland. The museum depicts the lives of coal mine workers and features original buildings and equipment from the former colliery, including the two headframes, a <b>winding</b> <b>house,</b> other <b>engine</b> <b>houses,</b> a steam <b>winding</b> <b>engine,</b> stables, a building with ventilation equipment, a blacksmith and joiners shop, and the office. Several buildings contain original equipment and mining exhibits, while others have been converted to museum exhibit areas or wedding, conference and event facilities.|$|R
25|$|Saltom Pit was {{constructed}} around 20ft above sea level, on land below the cliffs near to Haig Colliery. The pit workings {{went down to}} a depth of 456ft (138m). Saltom Pit ceased working coal in 1848, but today it is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SM 27801) and is the best known surviving example of an 18th-century colliery layout. Evidence of the shaft, horse gin, stable, <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house,</b> boiler house and chimney, cottages, cartroads and retaining walls, all survives in situ.|$|E
500|$|Francis Taylor is {{the first}} {{recorded}} fatality at the colliery, killed by a roof fall at [...] "Bradford coal pitt" [...] in 1622. Although the mines were relatively gas-free, there were nevertheless some gas-related incidents. One collier, working {{by the light of}} a candle in 1874, died from burns received in an explosion of firedamp. In 1907 a miner died in a shotfiring incident, when gas exploded as a fuse was lit. In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to the surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop, causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the main <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages crashing {{to the bottom of the}} main shaft and trapping 350men underground. All managed to reach a smaller shaft [...] away and were subsequently brought safely to the surface.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first part}} of the North Sydney tramway system was a {{double-track}} cable tramway which started at the original Milsons Point wharf, located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred Street (now Alfred Street South), Junction Street (now Pacific Highway), Blue Street and Miller Streets to the <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> and depot at Ridge Street. It used cable grip cars called [...] "dummies" [...] and unpowered trailer cars, similar to the large Melbourne cable tramway system but quite different from the surviving lines in San Francisco, where everything is combined in a single vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|The Urquhart shaft's Uskside <b>Winding</b> <b>Engine,</b> {{which was}} <b>housed</b> in a shed {{immediately}} {{to the north of}} the headframe, has been removed from the site and installed at the [...] "Outback@Isa Explorers Park" [...] tourist facility in the town. The original corrugated iron winding shed which had been replaced by more recent ribbed steel sheets on the former frame and concrete surface, has also been removed from the site.|$|R
50|$|The company {{supplied}} a 3,300 {{horse power}} twin tandem compound engine which survives in the <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> at the Astley Green Colliery Museum {{which was the}} largest steam <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> used on the Lancashire Coalfield.|$|R
50|$|The incline at Swannington {{is under}} the {{supervision}} of the Swannington Heritage Trust and the track bed down the incline has been opened as a footpath with information boards. The foundations of the <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> at the top of the incline, , have been uncovered and about 75 yd of track laid have been relaid. The historic <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> was removed from here after the inclined closed to the National Railway Museum at York.|$|R
50|$|Inside the <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house,</b> supplementing {{the winding}} engine is a smaller jack engine, {{housed in the}} rear. These were used to lift heavy equipment, and in deep mines, act as a relief winding engine.|$|E
50|$|Ridge Street Depot was {{originally}} a cable tram depot and <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> {{that opened in}} 1886. On the conversion to electric operation the depot was extensively rebuilt in 1902 to enlarge the tram shed to twelve roads.|$|E
50|$|The are {{restored}} mining {{buildings to}} explore in the site, including a locomotive shed, <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house,</b> blacksmith's shop, compressor house and Cornish engine. A circular walk links them, but some areas may {{be restricted to}} protect residents’ privacy. Stiperstones nature reserve can be accessed from this site.|$|E
50|$|Astley Green Colliery has {{the only}} {{surviving}} headgear and <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> {{on what was}} the Lancashire coalfield. The headgear is made from wrought iron lattice girders with rivetted plates at the joints. It has two large and one small wheel mounted at the top. It is nearly 30 m high and was built by Head Wrightson of Stockton-on-Tees and completed by 1912. In the winding house there is a twin tandem compound steam engine made by Yates and Thom of Blackburn who supplied 16 Lancashire boilers. Its <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> has the largest steam <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> used on the coafield. The 3,300 horse power twin tandem compound engine was built by Yates & Thom in Blackburn.|$|R
50|$|A sinking <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> {{would be}} {{established}} in a temporary corrugated iron <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> {{very similar to the}} one onsite at the Black Country Living Museum. The sinking winder, powered by a steam engine, was used to re-open a shaft at the Black Country Living Museum {{in the same way that}} 90 or 100 years ago they would have opened a new shaft. The miners digging out the shaft were lowered down in the bowk. The bowk then removed the spoil as it was dug out, and the circular shaft was lined with brickwork.|$|R
500|$|The {{new owners}} {{embarked}} on a programme of expansion and installed {{one of the earliest}} electrical plants at any colliery in 1900. A sirocco-type ventilation fan made by Hick, Hargreaves, which could be powered by either electricity or steam, was provided. Deepening the downcast shaft to access the Deep mine at [...] started in 1903 and coal was reached in 1906. A massive timber headgear was built over the downcast shaft and a twin-cylinder vertical <b>winding</b> <b>engine,</b> built by Robert Daglish of St Helens, installed in the <b>engine</b> <b>house.</b> Coal tubs holding 10 cwt of coal were wound, six at a time in double-deck cages. The upcast shaft was used for winding men and had a smaller horizontal <b>winding</b> <b>engine.</b> An earlier shaft at the Forge pit was [...] deep and used for pumping water from the workings. A windlass was used for winding at this shaft.|$|R
50|$|The main {{buildings}} in the yard were the wooden headgear, the <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house,</b> the boiler house with its square bricked chimney and the fan house for ventilating the underground workings. A small steam driven power plant supplied the electricity. The fitters', the blacksmiths' and the joiners' shops were all combined into one building.|$|E
5000|$|Several of the {{structures}} at Wheal Peevor became Grade II listed buildings on 12 September 1989: the stamps house, the pump house {{a house on the}} property north of the pump engine house [...] and the <b>Winding</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>House.</b> [...] A portion of the mine has been designated as a historic monument since 15 January 1974 ...|$|E
50|$|Claypon's Tramroad can be {{followed}} {{for much of}} its length. At the Onllwyn end it has been obliterated by opencasting and subsequent land restoration but lengthy sections can {{be followed}} around Mynydd y Drum, including sections where runs of stone blocks still remain. The mile-long incline down into Ystradgynlais can be followed including the ruined remains of the <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> at the summit.|$|E
5000|$|The mine had a {{substantial}} stone and slate <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> with a rotary beam pumping and <b>winding</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1878-9 the machinery and its <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> were dismantled, moved to Burrow Farm mine and re-erected, leaving bare foundations at Langham Hill. When the mines closed the Ebbw Vale Company {{not only had}} to bear considerable losses [...] but it also became liable for duties and charges it had entered into in the heady early days when the Brendon Hills seemed like Klondyke. James Insole, owner of the Chargot Estate, entered litigation with the company for {{costs associated with the}} cessation of mining. This eventually went to arbitration, where the main beneficiaries were lawyers and the main loser was the Ebbw Vale Company. In the midst of this the Ebbw Vale company covered the Langham Hill <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> foundations with the pit tip, landscaping the site to appease Insole. Remarkably, this had a beneficial outcome, as it [...] "preserved" [...] the foundations so that when the Exmoor National Park Authority excavated them in 1995-8 they were found to be in good order. They can be visited to this day.|$|R
50|$|A <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{stationary}} engine {{used to control}} a cable, for example to power a mining hoist at a pit head. Electric hoist controllers have replaced proper <b>winding</b> <b>engines</b> in modern mining, but use electric motors that are also traditionally referred to as <b>winding</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

50|$|Despite some demolition, {{the complex}} of buildings, which {{includes}} {{parts of the}} goods depot, the <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house,</b> the Roundhouse, the eastern portal of Primrose Hill railway tunnel, and the canal, represent {{one of the most}} important groupings of nineteenth century transport infrastructure to have survived in Britain. The survival of the horse tunnel and stairs shows the importance of horse-drawn transport in the developing railway system.|$|E
5000|$|Cromford and High Peak Railway {{opened in}} 1831 with grades up to 1 in 8. There were nine {{inclined}} planes: eight were engine-powered, {{one was a}} counterbalance (gravity) type operated by a horse gin. The Middleton Top <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> at the summit of Middleton Incline has been preserved and the ancient steam engine inside, once used to haul wagons up, is often demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|Dominating the {{colliery}} site are {{the above}} ground structures {{of a deep}} (i.e. vertical shaft) mine - the brick built <b>Winding</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>House,</b> and the red painted wooden Heapstead. These were relocated to the museum (which never had its own vertical shaft), the winding house coming from Beamish Chophill Colliery, and the Heapstead from Ravensworth Park Mine in Gateshead.

2500|$|Erected for the Earl of Carnarvon in 1891. The <b>wind</b> <b>engine</b> pumped {{water from}} a well [...] deep. It was last used in the 1920s. The sails were removed in the 1960s and placed in storage. Restoration of the <b>wind</b> <b>engine</b> was {{undertaken}} by Hampshire Industrial Archaeology Society and Hampshire Mills Group with assistance from the British Engineerium, Hove for the Crux Easton <b>Wind</b> <b>Engine</b> Restoration Trust. The restoration {{was funded by the}} Heritage Lottery Fund, which was asked to contribute £149,750 of the estimated £226,180 cost. Other grants were received from Basingstoke & Deane District Council, Hampshire County Council. and the Vodafone Charitable Trust. Restoration of the <b>wind</b> <b>engine</b> was delayed due to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease. The restored <b>wind</b> <b>engine</b> was officially opened on 25 September 2002 by Sir George Young.|$|R
5000|$|The steel headframe, 24m {{in height}} and with twin pulleys 3m in diameter, was {{purchased}} second-hand in Charters Towers {{as was the}} horizontal twin-cylinder <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> built by Walkers Limited of Maryborough.

5000|$|It was an independent, volunteer-led {{project to}} provide a {{permanent}} archive of the local mining history and community resource within the remaining <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house,</b> which is now a scheduled ancient monument. [...] One of the two massive steam winding engines had been returned to working order, and many artifacts were on permanent display to help describe {{the life of the}} local miners and the social history of the area.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the head}} frame and <b>winding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> and steam winding {{engine of the}} Hetty Pit are Grade I listed {{buildings}} and Scheduled Ancient Monuments. The Fan House is Grade II* listed. It was originally intended to incorporate the site into the Rhondda Heritage Park, but its future is now unclear. The Hetty winding house and engine are now being renovated by volunteers under supervision of Mr Brian Davies of the Pontypridd Museum.|$|E
