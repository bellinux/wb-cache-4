5000|$|The {{right hand}} valve {{is often called}} the flow <b>wing</b> <b>valve</b> or the {{production}} <b>wing</b> <b>valve,</b> because {{it is in the}} flowpath the hydrocarbons take to production facilities (or the path water or gas will take from production to the well in the case of injection wells).|$|E
50|$|Pumping is the {{simplest}} form of intervention {{as it does}} not involve putting hardware into the well itself. Frequently it simply involves rigging up to the kill <b>wing</b> <b>valve</b> on the Christmas tree and pumping the chemicals into the well.|$|E
50|$|The {{left hand}} valve {{is often called}} the kill <b>wing</b> <b>valve</b> (KWV). It is {{primarily}} used for injection of fluids such as corrosion inhibitors or methanol to prevent hydrate formation. In the North Sea, {{it is called the}} non-active side arm (NASA). It is typically manually operated.|$|E
40|$|Prostrate to {{scrambling}} perennial succulent herb; leaves imbricate, flat triangular in sectional view, with tips incurved, 30 - 40 × 10 - 15 mm, {{with large}} bladder cells giving foliage a glistening surface, dying back after flowering to leave skeletal remains; flowers (Jul-Sept.) white, pale yellow, pale pink or salmon, ± 20 - 30 mm in diameter; fruits 4 - 5 locular, with <b>valve</b> <b>wings...</b>|$|R
2500|$|These were {{specifically}} {{made for}} the Photo-Reconnaissance Spitfires, including the PR Mk X and XI; no armament was fitted and the [...] "D" [...] shaped leading edges of the wings, ahead of the main spar, were converted into integral fuel tanks, each carrying 66 gallons. To avoid the expansion of fuel in hot weather damaging the <b>wing,</b> pressure relief <b>valves,</b> incorporating small external vent pipes, were fitted near the wing tips.|$|R
50|$|The wing is an {{inflatable}} buoyancy bladder, {{similar to that}} in other varieties of BCD, except that it is not in or permanently attached to the harness part of a BCD. As with other BCDs, wings have an inflation valve on a corrugated hose, dump valve, and over pressure <b>valve.</b> <b>Wings</b> are usually oval (annular, doughnut or toroidal) or U-shaped (horseshoe), and are designed to wrap slightly around the diving cylinder(s) when inflated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} plant {{is said to}} begin after the production <b>wing</b> <b>valve</b> on the oil well. The product from each well is piped through the choke valve, which regulates the rate of flow. The flowlines are gathered at the inlet manifold and routed into a separator, which will separate the three components. Once the oil has been separated from the gas and produced water, it is usually routed to a coalescer before being metered and pumped to the onshore terminal.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if {{a section}} of pipe from a {{production}} line leading from a [...] Christmas tree to the process plant, were to need replacement, {{this area of the}} piping would need isolation before the offending section was removed or oil would be able to flow freely out of the piping into the environment, causing environmental damage, a health and safety hazard and waste of a precious resource. Under the two barrier rule, there must be two separate isolations between the oil flowing from the well to this area of the piping. The logical barriers in this case would be the production <b>wing</b> <b>valve</b> and the upper master valve.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of oil wells, pumping is a routine {{operation}} involving injecting fluids into the well. Pumping may either be done by rigging up to the kill <b>wing</b> <b>valve</b> on the [...] Xmas tree or, if an intervention rig up is present pumping into the riser through a T-piece (a small section of riser with a connection on the side). Pumping is most routinely done to protect the well against scale and hydrates through the pumping of scale inhibitors and methanol. Pumping of kill weight brine may be done {{for the purposes of}} well kills and more exotic chemicals may be pumped from surface for cleaning the lower completion or stimulating the reservoir (though these types are jobs are more frequently done with coiled tubing for extra precision).|$|E
5000|$|... 1997 GL1500s {{received}} engine, {{transmission and}} final drive improvements first introduced on the GL1500C; Aspencade price rose slightly to $14,900. A 1998 Gold Wing styling makeover {{extended to the}} engine with redesigned valve covers, but no price increase. Honda commemorated 50 years in America by adding 50th Anniversary emblems to all 1999 Gold Wings; the GL1500A '99 price increased to $15,100. The 2000 Gold <b>Wings</b> had chrome-plated <b>valve</b> covers, Canadian and American models also had gold-plated 25th Anniversary emblems marking 25 years since the first GL1000 debuted for the 1975 model year.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{tremendous}} {{increase in research}} activity and publications in Polymer matrix composite materials and nanostructures {{in the last few}} years, this article is an attempt to identify the topics that are most relevant to Shape Memory Polymer Composite (SMPC) materials and review representative journal publications that are related to those topics. Articles covering developments in Fabrication methods and integrated structural and non-structural functions characterization are emphasized. Structural functions include mechanical properties like strength, stiffness, fracture toughness, and damping, while non–structural functions include electrical and/or thermal conductivity, sensing and actuation, energy harvesting/storage, self-healing capability, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, recyclability and biodegradability. Many of these recent developments are associated with Actuating mechanisms of Shape memory polymer composite materials and corresponding advances in nanomaterials and nanostructures, as are many of the articles reviewed. The article concludes with a discussion of recent applications of Shape memory Polymers and structures, such as morphing aircraft <b>wings,</b> Industrial <b>valves,</b> seals etc., and in biomedical SMPs for dispensing drugs and diagnostics, and optically transparent impact absorbing structures. Several suggestions regarding future research needs are also presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} dispatch {{decision is}} a complex analysis based on many factors related to airworthiness regulations, aircraft health status, resource availability at current and future stop(s) and operational preferences of the operator. Within the turnaround time (TAT) a decision {{has to be made}} whether the aircraft can return to service, defects have to be deferred, operational restrictions apply, maintenance has to be performed, or if the aircraft is unable to safely perform the next flight. This paper presents a framework for automated dispatch decision support and, as a first step of implementation of the framework, a proof of concept for automated root cause identification by means of a case study on a Airbus A 320 <b>wing</b> anti-ice <b>valve.</b> A decision tree algorithm has been applied to a synthetic dataset, representing historical failure data with associated root causes and observed symptoms, achieving correct classification of the root cause for 40 % of the cases. Analysis of the results show that the accuracy of the method increases with an increasing number of symptoms associated to a root cause. Furthermore, the method cannot distinguish between root causes with similar symptoms. Although the use of synthetic data restricts conclusions that can be drawn from the results, the work shows a proof of concept for automated root cause identification and leads to initial findings that are essential for future implementation and optimisation of the method. Eventually, the framework will be operationalised {{in the form of a}} mobile tool to assist stakeholders in on-site aircraft dispatch decision support. Aerospace Transport & Operation...|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{sophisticated}} surface tree {{will have}} at least four or five valves, normally arranged in a crucifix type pattern (hence the endurance of the term [...] "Christmas tree"). The two lower valves are called the master valves (upper and lower respectively). Master valves are normally in the fully open position and are never opened or closed when the well is flowing (except in an emergency) to prevent erosion of the valve sealing surfaces. The lower master valve will normally be manually operated, while the upper master valve is often hydraulically actuated, allowing it {{to be used as}} a means of remotely shutting in the well in the event of emergency. An actuated <b>wing</b> <b>valve</b> is normally used to shut in the well when flowing, thus preserving the master valves for positive shut off for maintenance purposes. Hydraulic operated wing valves are usually built to be fail safe closed, meaning they require active hydraulic pressure to stay open. This feature means that if control fluid fails the well will automatically shut itself in without operator action.|$|E
