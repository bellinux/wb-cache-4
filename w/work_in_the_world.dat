25|$|According to Reformed theologians, God's self-revelation {{is always}} through his son Jesus Christ, because Christ {{is the only}} {{mediator}} between God and people. Revelation of God through Christ comes through two basic channels. The first is creation and providence, which is God's creating and continuing to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> This action of God gives everyone knowledge about God, but this knowledge is only sufficient to make people culpable for their sin; {{it does not include}} knowledge of the gospel. The second channel through which God reveals himself is redemption, which is the gospel of salvation from condemnation which is punishment for sin.|$|E
