5|$|The {{director}} of Kansas Saloon Smashers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist {{who came to}} work for Edison as a cameraman in 1900. Eventually, Porter became the director responsible for all of Edison Studios' output. Porter based the set off of {{a photograph of a}} wrecked saloon which appeared in the Journal, while the characters and plot were based on editorial cartoons published in the paper. Porter frequently read the publication <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> inspiration on topics that filmgoers would be interested in.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to taxi, Tibbets leaned {{out the window to}} direct the bystanders out of the way.

5|$|Varno later filed {{a second}} {{arbitration}} upon learning that Gene Corman was to receive writing {{credit for the}} original story. Varno claimed Corman {{had nothing to do}} with the story, and produced large amounts of dated notes he claimed proved he wrote it himself. Varno won both arbitration matters. However, Roger Corman refused to pay Varno, and as a result he was not allowed to use Writers Guild of America members on his films. Corman used non-union writers for several years, but he finally agreed to pay Varno <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to use a union writer on one of his films. Varno said he would have sought more money for the delay, but he was out of the country when Corman paid the money and missed his opportunity. Additionally, despite winning arbitration in the writing credit matter, Gene Corman was given on-screen original story credit in Night of the Blood Beast. When contacted by the distributor, American International Pictures, he was told removing Corman's credit would mean recalling all of the prints and changing them, which would have cost thousands of dollars, and Varno agreed to allow it to remain unchanged.|$|E
5|$|TNA held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match pitting {{the team}} of Alex Shelley, Christopher Daniels, Roderick Strong, and Samoa Joe against {{the team of}} Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. Matt Bentley was {{accompanied}} by Traci to the ring. The duration of this bout was 23 minutes and 15 seconds. Daniels took over the leadership role of his team, naming them Team Ministry. In this match, each person from each team had to be eliminated by pinfall or submission until all members of one team were gone. The wrestler(s) that remained won the bout for their team. Strong was the first eliminated after being pinned by Aries following a 450° aerial splash. Aries was eliminated soon-after by Daniels, who pinned him with a roll-up while he was distracted by Joe. The third elimination was Dutt, who submitted to Shelley's signature Border City Stretch submission hold. Not long after, Shelley was pinned by Bentley after being kicked in the face. Joe forced Bentley to submit with his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold, bringing the match down to Daniels and Joe versus Sabin. Daniels won the bout for his team by pinning Sabin after slamming Sabin face-first into the mat with his signature Angel's Wings maneuver. An argument ensued between Daniels and Joe after the contest, with Joe angry in the storyline that Daniels eliminated Sabin <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to instead. This led to Joe attacking Daniels and bashing him {{over the head with}} a steal chair. Joe followed up by slamming Daniels into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then a second time on a steal chair. This left Daniels bloodied {{in the center of the}} ring with TNA's medical crew tending to his injuries.|$|E

25|$|For example, a {{landowner}} {{may have}} a sharecropper farming an irrigated hayfield. The sharecropper uses his own equipment, and covers all the costs of fuel and fertilizer. The landowner pays the irrigation district assessments and does the irrigating himself. The sharecropper cuts and bales the hay, and delivers one-third of the baled hay to the landlord's feedlot.

Humans were machines that were only important for carrying genes, and it made sense for a gene to sacrifice a human if it meant that another copy of the gene elsewhere could prosper.|$|E

25|$|Ireland {{was changed}} from a lordship to a full Kingdom under Henry VIII. From {{the period of the}} {{original}} lordship in the 12th century onwards, Ireland had retained its own bicameral Parliament of Ireland, consisting of a House of Commons and a House of Lords. It was restricted for most of its existence in terms both of membership – Gaelic Irishmen were barred from membership – and of powers, notably by Poynings' Law of 1494, which required the approval of the English Privy Council before any draft bills might be introduced to the Parliament. After 1541, Henry VIII admitted native Irish lords into both houses and recognised their land titles, in return for their submission to him as King of Ireland. However, the real power in Ireland throughout this period lay not with the Parliament, but with the Lord Deputy of Ireland, who was nominated by the King of England to govern Ireland. The Parliament met only when called by the Lord Deputy, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to pass new laws or raise new taxes. The Lord Deputy's permanent advisors were the Irish Privy Council.|$|E
25|$|The other {{officers}} in Danyang {{were well aware}} that Gai Lan and Dai Yuan were the masterminds behind Sun Yi's murder but were unable {{to take action against}} the two men because their powers were limited. Gai Lan took over Sun Yi's residence and seized Sun's concubines and servants for himself. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to take Lady Xu (Sun Yi's widow), she declined, said that it was too soon after her husband's death to remarry, and told him to wait for a month. During the intervening period, Lady Xu secretly contacted Sun Gao (孫高), Fu Ying (傅嬰) and other former subordinates of Sun Yi, informed them of the circumstances, and plotted with them to avenge her husband. On the appointed day, Lady Xu changed out of her mourning garments and invited Gai Lan to her personal quarters, where Sun Gao and Fu Ying, in disguise as maids, ambushed and killed Gai while the others slew Dai Yuan. Gai Lan and Dai Yuan's heads were cut off and offered as propitiation at Sun Yi's altar. This incident shocked everyone in Danyang. Shortly thereafter, Sun Quan came to Danyang to reward those who remained loyal to Sun Yi and punish those who conspired with Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|E

25|$|In May 1840, journalist, {{publisher}} and republican revolutionary Eillert Meeter and 25 comrades {{were arrested in}} Groningen after removing a painting of William I from a pub and toasting on the republic. They were suspected of conspiracy against the monarchy, but released three months later because the allegations could not be proven. Nevertheless, the public prosecutor tried to convict Meeter to four years imprisonment for his anti-authoritarian writings in his magazine De Tolk der Vrijheid ("The Spokesman of Freedom"); he fled to Belgium in February 1841, and eventually to Paris. From there, he requested and was granted amnesty by King William II, and moved to Amsterdam. As an investigative journalist, he gathered all kinds of scandalous stories of William II's personal life, including his attempts to become king of France or Belgium, a conspiracy against his own father <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to remarry, and finally the king's secret homosexuality (considered perverse at the time). From 1840 to 1848, King William II frequently paid Meeter well to keep him silent. In 1857, Meeter published his memoires including his findings on royal affairs in English in London, Holland, Its Institutions, Its Press, Kings and Prisons, and although he {{had been accused of}} being a liar ever since, documents from the Royal House Archive in 2004 revealed he had written the truth., Voor de troon wordt niemand ongestraft geboren (2007).|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E

25|$|Clodius {{sought to}} become a plebeian tribune {{so that he could}} enjoy the powers of these tribunes to pursue his revenge against Cicero. These powers {{included}} presiding over the plebeian council and propose bills to its vote and the power to veto the actions of the officers of state and the senatus consulta (written opinions of the senate on bills, which were presented for advice and usually followed to the letter). However, Clodius was a patrician and the plebeian tribunate was exclusively for plebeians. Therefore, he needed to be transferred to the plebeian order (transitio ad plebem) by being adopted into a plebeian family. In some letters written in 62 BC, the year after Clodius’s trial, Cicero wrote that Herrenius, a plebeian tribune, made frequent proposals to the plebeian council to transfer Clodius to the plebs, but he was vetoed by many of his colleagues. He also proposed a law to the plebeian council to authorise the comitia centuriata (the assembly of the soldiers) to vote on the matter. The consul Quintus Metellus Celer proposed an identical bill to the comitia centuriata. Later in the year, Cicero wrote that Metellus Celer was ‘offering Clodius ‘a splendid opposition’. The whole senate rejected it. Cassius Dio, instead, wrote that in that year Clodius actually got his transitio ad plebem and immediately sought the tribunate. However, he was not elected due to the opposition of Metellus Celer, who argued that his transitio ad plebem was not done in accordance with tradition because this had to be done according to the lex curiata, which provided that adrogatio should be performed in the comitia curiata. In other words, Metellus Celer argued that the adoption was illegal. Cassius Dio wrote that this ended the episode. During his consulship Caesar effected this transitio ad plebem and had him elected as plebeian tribune with the cooperation of Pompey. Clodius silenced Calpurnius Bibulus <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a speech {{on the last day of}} his consulship in 59 BC and also attacked Cicero.|$|E
