50|$|The hull is wooden and V-shaped, with a {{hard chine}} and a square stern. In order to provide a stable {{platform}} when dredging, skipjacks have very low freeboard and a wide beam (averaging one third the length on deck). A centerboard is mounted {{in lieu of a}} keel. The mast is hewn from a single log, with two stays on either side, without spreaders; it is stepped towards the bow of the boat, with a small cabin. As typical in regional practice the bow features a curving longhead under the bowsprit, with carved and painted trailboards. A small figurehead is common. A typical skipjack is 40 to 50 feet in length. The boats use direct link Edson <b>worm</b> <b>steering</b> gear mounted immediately forward of the transom.|$|E

40|$|When you {{slip into}} the large and comfortably {{cushioned}} seat of a Farmall-H or a Farmall·M nd rest {{your hands on the}} large, automobile type steering wheel. right away you feel at home. As your left foot just naturally finds the clutch pedal and you put the tractor into gear you begin to get the feeling that here is a tractor that is as easy 10 drive as the family car. And as you give it the gas (gasoline. distillate or kerosene). and let in the clutch, you get the thrill which comes with the realization that here, under finger. tip control, is ready, eager power to romp through all your farm power jobs with salis· factoty thoroughness, speed and economy. When you hit rough ground you learn what it means todrive a tractor with irreversible <b>worm</b> <b>steering</b> gear. Yet. while none of the shocks occasioned by the front wheels encountering humps or bumps are passed back to your arms, you find the tractor instontly responsive to the lightest touch. Convenient to the right foot tl,re two differential brake pedals. For making short turns to right or lEft these pedals can be used separately. For equal brak iog of both rear wheels they can be instantly locked together 10 operate as one brake. The brakes and external expanding bands acting on forged sleel drums on the differential shafts. The large illustration at the riqht shows how conveniently the various controls are located.

50|$|The {{suspension}} is by double A-arms, {{manganese bronze}} trunnion, coil springs and tube shocks at the front, optional anti-roll bar, and with <b>worm</b> and peg <b>steering.</b> Unlike MGs {{of the same}} period, the steering mechanism and linkage have considerable play and friction, which increase with wear.|$|R
50|$|Ferrari America is {{a series}} of top-end Ferrari models built in the 1950s and 1960s. They were large grand touring cars with the largest V12 engines and often had custom bodywork. All America models used a live axle in the rear, were front-engined, and had <b>worm</b> and sector <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>worm</b> and sector <b>steering</b> box {{was fixed}} to the engine and {{received}} lubrication from it. All four wheels had internally expanding brakes. The hand lever operated only the back pair. Unconventional in action it was simplified for the following Motor Show. The front brakes used the Perrot system. The car's springs were all half-elliptical, flat-set and gaitered.|$|R
5000|$|The S9, a model {{based on}} the 840 JL truck range cab, is powered by the F 646 Fulgur engine, a 6.8-litre six-cylinder diesel {{delivering}} [...] at 1,500 rpm and a torque of 422 Nm at 1,650 rpm. The truck has a six-speed [...] "synchromesh" [...] manual gearbox. As the other S models, the S9 has a leaf spring suspension and a gammer <b>worm</b> and roller <b>steering.</b> Its wheelbases are between 3000 mm and 4600 mm.|$|R
50|$|The 125 F1 used a {{supercharged}} 1.5-litre V12 {{engine and}} sported a steel tube-frame chassis with longitudinal and cross members. It had a double wishbone suspension with a {{transverse leaf spring}} in front and a torsion bar in the rear which was upgraded to a de Dion tube for 1950. <b>Worm</b> and sector <b>steering</b> and four-wheel drum brakes were the norm for the time. The 2160 mm wheelbase was uprated to 2320 mm in the 1949 redesign. The chassis and transmission design was by Valerio Colotti.|$|R
2500|$|The {{change in}} the body style from the Mark B was both {{functional}} and aesthetic. The Mark C utilised the same 180° <b>steering</b> lock and <b>worm</b> and sector <b>steering</b> system that {{was seen in the}} prototype Commercial and the front wings allowed for ample clearance at full lock. They also addressed a demand from customers for a [...] "greater smoothness of line", and allowed a more robust location for the mounting of the front lights. Other improvements included rod and cable operated brakes on all three wheels, which [...] "appreciably shortens stopping distances." ...|$|R
5000|$|All Morris {{cars were}} given anti-splash side-shields to their front wings. The Minor {{was given a}} new better-looking {{radiator}} and longer bonnet, better steering by Bishop cam, and a four-speed gearbox. The £100 2-seater kept the old radiator, three-speed gearbox, <b>worm</b> and wheel <b>steering</b> and windscreen of a singe panel.Morris displayed at the next Motor Show in October 1932 a Minor chassis for £87.10.0. For £90 the same chassis came equipped with a four-speed twin-top gearbox ("silent" [...] third), cam steering and deep radiator.

The suspension of the four trucks have leaf springs on both axles. Brakes are hydraulic [...] (S5) and air brakes (S7 and S8).They have a five-speed [...] "synchromesh" [...] manual gearbox and a gammer <b>worm</b> and roller <b>steering</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The 1914 {{model was}} {{exhibited}} at the 1913 Olympia show, the company still named Swift Cycle Co Ltd, at which time its price was £140 'fully equipped'. For 1914 the car changed over to steel channel frame carried on four semi-elliptic leaf springs. The car had <b>worm</b> and sector <b>steering,</b> and the brakes comprised a pedal operated transmission brake and two hand-lever operated external contracting brakes. The two-seater body had the seats slightly staggered, and the specification included the hood, adjustable windscreen, a boot, mudguards, running boards, and an acetylene lighting set. The engine remained at 970cc and was fitted with an Eisemann magneto and Claudel carburettor. The clutch was a leather lined cone type fitted into the external flywheel. The petrol tank was placed behind the dashboard and fed the carburettor by gravity.|$|R
50|$|Like the VW Typ 166, the Typ 87 has a {{modified}} KdF-Wagen chassis. The backbone tube was increased in diameter {{to hold the}} additional cardan shaft for the front wheel drive. The steering knuckles were modified for the drive shaft. A <b>worm</b> and sector <b>steering</b> is used. The rear axle is equipped with reduction gears, both front and rear axle differentials are lockable. A single disc dry clutch transmits the torque from the engine to the manual four-speed gearbox which is equipped with an additional offroad gear. The offroad gear is activated with a lever, {{as well as the}} front wheel drive. With activated front wheel drive, the top speed is 10 km/h and the maximum slope climbing angle is 33,75°. The Typ 87 is powered by an air-cooled flat-four-cylinder-otto engine with a displacement of 1131 cm3 and a rated power of 18 kW.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} process sequence {{of a power}} <b>steering</b> <b>worm</b> gear blank is analyzed. The conventional process sequence for manufacturing power assisted steering (PAS) part contains three distinctive operational stages such as indentation, extrusion, and upsetting, which were originally designed by forming equipment experts. Process conditions such as reduction in area, semi die angle and upsetting ratio are carefully considered to prevent from internal or geometrical defects. The simulation results of the conventional forging process are summarized in terms of deformation patterns, load-stroke relationships and die pressures along the interface for each operational stage. Close investigation of simulation results for current forming process leads to a new process sequence in which the number of operation are reduced into just one operation. Comparisons between the existing and proposed processes are made in terms of maximum force requirement, required forming energy, and process time, respectively. Experiment has been performed {{to confirm that the}} proposed process could be applied to replace the existing conventional process sequence and proved the new process to be a safe process sequence for manufacturing PAS part...|$|R
