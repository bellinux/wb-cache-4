5|$|In Milford, Massachusetts, men in Hazmat suits drop a woman (Maria Dizzia) {{out of a}} <b>white</b> <b>van,</b> {{who then}} enters a nearby diner.

5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe the driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a <b>white</b> <b>van.</b> A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lanka {{became an}} {{independent}} nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil {{community has been}} strained. Sri Lanka {{has been unable to}} contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war. The Sri Lankan Civil War has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past. The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see <b>White</b> <b>van</b> abductions in Sri Lanka). Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.|$|E

25|$|On October 21, Richmond-area {{police arrested}} two men, {{one with a}} <b>white</b> <b>van,</b> outside a gas station.

A total of 18 people ignored her, some {{going so far as to}} walk around the blood. The girl was left for seven minutes before a recycler, Chen Xianmei, picked up the toddler and called for help. The child died eight days later.|$|E

50|$|Most food is {{transported by}} road {{nowadays}} {{due to the}} shorter journey times. The stock of refrigerated vans owned by railway companies has therefore shrunk considerably.

25|$|The {{third and}} final series focused on a {{different}} character each week but with the overlaps creating a more complex layering of the plot, more akin to a one-off episode of a situation comedy (albeit with intertwined plots) than a traditional sketch show. The end of each episode features a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> swerving to avoid a pedestrian and crashing into a garden wall. Some residents escape unharmed, while others are not so lucky. A red plastic bag is seen being blown by the wind through the town in every episode, indicating that all the stories occur simultaneously. It is the only series {{that does not include}} a laugh track.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the ransoming process, the Cázares {{were allowed}} to talk with their {{remaining}} relatives in three occasions. In their first phone conversation, the victims talked about their concern for their wives and children. Their second conversation was a lot shorter and emotive for the Cázares, however. By July 27, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash deliver in order to release them. The Cázares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a disclosed location for a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> {{that was supposed to}} deliver their relatives. The van never came and the phone line that the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. Weeks after that, the family decided to contact law enforcement.|$|E
25|$|Once in Rome, Vanunu and Bentov took {{a taxi to}} an {{apartment}} in the old quarter of the city, where three waiting Mossad operatives overpowered Vanunu and injected him with a paralyzing drug. Later that night, a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> hired by the Israeli embassy arrived, and Vanunu was carried to it on a stretcher. The van drove to La Spezia, where the agents took Vanunu to a dock, bound him to a stretcher, and put him on a waiting speedboat, which then rendezvoused with the waiting Noga anchored off the coast. The crew of the Noga were told to assemble in the ship's common room and lock the door as Vanunu and the Mossad agents were taken aboard. The ship then departed for Israel.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, 2011, alleged gunmen of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped 18 {{members of}} the Cázares family from three {{different}} households in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The children and women were eventually released three days later, but the abductors kept five men. Forty-eight hours later, the Gulf Cartel contacted the members who had been released to start negotiating ransom. After several days of negotiation and several ransom payments totaling US$100,000, the Cázares were called to deliver their final payment on July 27. They sent {{the money to the}} kidnappers and waited in a disclosed location for a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> the kidnappers had pledged to deliver their remaining family members. However, the van never arrived and the phone the kidnappers used to contact the Cázares went out of service. The family then decided to contact authorities and open the case. The Cázares men have been missing ever since.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 2008, Way was {{involved}} in a serious accident on the A3088 Cartgate link road between the A303 and Yeovil whilst a passenger in a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> he was passenger in collided head-on with a blue 4x4. He was airlifted to Dorchester Hospital, where his condition was described as serious but stable, before being treated at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. His injuries included a broken left femur, broken left kneecap, broken and dislocated right elbow, broken and dislocated left hip, multiple fractures of his right wrist, damage to his right hand, a ruptured left bicep, deep cuts to both shins and soft tissue damage. Initially Way hoped that {{he would be able to}} resume his footballing career. On 22 January 2009, Way was discharged from Yeovil Hospital, after having thirteen operations, marking a huge step on his road to recovery, although he was still wheelchair bound. During half-time in Terry Skiverton's first match in charge against Oldham Athletic, on 21 February 2009, Way came on the pitch in his wheelchair and did a lap of honour. Way had to learn how to walk again after his accident, and after his retirement he and stadium technician Bruce James were involved in a lengthy legal battle in the High Court with the insurers of the 4x4 driver over compensation for the accident.|$|E

25|$|Eyewitness {{accounts}} of the attacks were mostly confused and spotty. Hotlines {{set up for the}} investigation were flooded with tips. Early tips from eyewitnesses included reports of a white box truck with dark lettering, speeding away from the Leisure World shopping center, with two men inside. Police across the area and the state of Maryland were pulling over <b>white</b> <b>vans</b> and trucks. A gray car was spotted speeding away after the October 4 shooting in Spotsylvania.|$|R
50|$|The cargo {{variety of}} the Express/Savana is popular as a work vehicle, often used by electricians, plumbers, and others needing to haul a variety of large items.

500|$|An [...] "ugly" [...] blonde-haired man {{was seen}} on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete, {{and again on}} 2 May {{across the road from}} 5A, {{apparently}} watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A's former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and saw him again on 2 May near the Tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, [...] "ugly" [...] with spots. On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns' apartment block, where a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> was parked.|$|E
500|$|Redwood said in 2013 {{that the}} {{disappearance}} [...] "on one {{reading of the}} evidence", did look like a pre-planned abduction: [...] "That undoubtedly would have involved reconnaissance." [...] Several witnesses described men hanging around near apartment 5A {{in the days before}} the disappearance and on the day itself. In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> who were offering their services to British expats. In October that year Scotland Yard and the BBC's Crimewatch staged a reconstruction—broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany—during which they released e-fits of the men seen near 5A and of the Smith sighting. Days after Crimewatch aired, Portugal's attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the time}} he began {{recording}} his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a <b>white</b> <b>van</b> followed him wherever he went. He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that DreamWorks was out to get him: [...] "Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have {{wound up in the}} hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house." [...] During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.|$|E
