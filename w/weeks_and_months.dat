Canada donated $412,201 worth of assistance, including providing shelter in Honduras and rebuilding schools. The country of Brazil donated about $1.68million worth of food. The Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission provided nearly $2.2million for relief efforts. Other European country donations included nearly $500,000 from Ireland for hygiene and food supplies, $675,675 from the Netherlands for general relief efforts, $154,570 from Spain through the World Food Programme, $159,559 from Germany for shelters, and $892,468 from Sweden. Several Asian countries donated to the relief efforts, including $123,810 from Japan to Honduras to purchase emergency goods, $22,000 from South Korea, and $10,000 from Singapore to Honduras. Non-governmental organizations and other groups providing aid included $1.5million from the Central Emergency Response Fund, $300,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $120,000 from Catholic Relief Services, and $289,000 from ACT Alliance.|$|E
5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement in the <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>months</b> {{prior to the}} Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated {{in the creation of}} Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a lack of confidence in the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E

Beamer also was considered for the vacant head-coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins, but he also declined that position. Other Virginia Tech football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head-coaching positions.

Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community in the <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>months</b> after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E

Given the time constraints under such conditions, brain morphometry is rarely involved in diagnostics but rather used for progress monitoring over periods of <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>months</b> and longer.|$|E
40|$|Hourly {{proportions}} (or {{time of day}} factors) {{are often}} needed for estimating highway link hourly volumes, which are important for models in air quality estimation, vehicle crash prediction and transportation planning. Hence, {{it is a common}} task for researchers or engineers in transportation to estimate hourly proportion models. This task, however, is very challenging because there are many factors that affect the hourly proportions. These factors in general include: (1) geometric and operational features, socio-economic characteristics and land use patterns associated with the highway network, and (2) temporal factors, including hour, day of <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>month.</b> The temporal factors in the second group contrast from those in the first group further in that they have distinct cyclic effects. ^ These factors should all be taken into account in an hourly proportion model. However, factors in the second group are generally not considered or considered in a highly approximate way in previous models. This is because, in order to consider these factors, the number of model parameters can become extremely large and beyond the capacities of existing model building tools and computers. Consequently, only annual average hourly proportions are estimated using the previous models, which in turn result in annual average hourly volume estimates. In many cases, the accuracy of the estimated hourly volumes cannot satisfy the rapidly increasing demands of more detailed and accurate vehicle emissions, accident prediction, and transportation planning models. ^ This work is intended to learn how to obtain more accurate hourly proportion estimates. This is carried out by first thoroughly investigating the effects of hour, day of <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>month</b> using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical procedure. The issue of primary concern here is to identify whether these factors interact with each other. Procedures are then established to group these factors. This includes the use of Comparison of Means statistical procedure (along with an engineering criterion) and a grouping algorithm developed ad hoc. The purpose of these exercises is to reduce the model size and make it feasible to include hour, day of <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>month,</b> as well as other factors, in hourly proportion models. In addition, hourly proportion models are estimated considering only hour, day of <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>month.</b> The hourly proportions estimated using these models can be used to estimate volumes for a specific hour, day of <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>month</b> in a year at a highway location, which in turn can significantly improve the accuracy of the hourly volume estimates. ...|$|R

This cerebellar degeneration can result in episodic or progressive ataxia. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes, but can last for <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>months.</b> An attack resembles a stroke, but unlike a stroke, it resolves in time.

25|$|Symptoms are {{not seen}} {{immediately}} in cattle {{due to the}} diseases’ extremely long incubation period. Some cattle have been observed to have an abnormal gait, changes in behavior, tremors and hyper-responsiveness to certain stimuli. Hindlimb ataxia affects the animal’s gait and occurs when muscle control is lost. This results in poor balance and coordination. Behavioural changes may include aggression, anxiety relating to certain situations, nervousness, frenzy or an overall change in temperament. Some rare but previously observed symptoms also include persistent pacing, rubbing or licking. Additionally, nonspecific symptoms have also been observed which include weight loss, decreased milk production, lameness, ear infections and teeth grinding due to pain. Some animals may show {{a combination of these}} symptoms, while others may only be observed demonstrating one of the many reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis {{was done in}} 21 patients who underwent urethroplasty. An assessment of the urinary flow, urinary symptoms (International Prostate Symptome Score ), erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function- 5 ) and urinary continence (International Consultation Committee on Incontinence Questionaire male Short Form ) was done before urethroplasty <b>and</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> after urethroplasty. Patients {{were also asked to}} score their satisfaction with the urethroplasty after 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months.</b> RESULTS: Mean patient's age was 48 years (range: 26 - 80 years). Mean stricture length was 4. 2 cm (range: 1 - 12 cm). Three patients suffered a stricture recurrence. Mean maximum urinary flow increased from 5. 83 mL/s to 24. 92 mL/s (p < 0. 001). Mean IPSS preoperative, 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> postoperative was respectively 15. 86, 4. 60 and 6. 41 (p < 0. 001). The mean IIEF- 5 score preoperative, 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> postoperative was respectively 15, 12. 13 and 11. 62 (not significant). The mean ICI-Q-SF score preoperative, 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> postoperative was respectively 10. 47, 8. 33 (p = 0. 04) and 9. 47 (p = 0. 31).
