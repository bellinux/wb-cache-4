One individual called “Betty” spontaneously made a <b>wire</b> <b>tool</b> to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it {{at the bottom of the}} well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and unsticking it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the straight wire first.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- WEDM is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} unconventional material cutting process used to manufacture components with complex shapes and profiles of hard materials. In this thermal erosion process, there is no physical contact between the <b>wire</b> <b>tool</b> and work materials. Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) is getting more tasks in fields like dies, punches, aero and many more. It is the very difficult task to get optimum process parameters for higher cutting efficiency. Accuracy is becoming a predominant factor nowadays. In this paper EN 31 is taken for study. The design of experiments (DOE) is done in taguchi L 27 orthogonal array (OA). In WEDM process rough machining gives lesser accuracy and finish machining gives fine surface finish, but it reduces the machining speed.

30|$|Wire {{electric}} discharge machining (WEDM) process {{has opened a}} new swing in the manufacturing sector. Non-traditional machining processes changed the whole scenario of manufacturing industries. Traditional machining processes are rapidly replaced by non-traditional methods for achieving better production rates and quality. One of the successful methods is WEDM, {{which is based on}} the conventional {{electric discharge}} machining (EDM). The principle remains the same for WEDM as in conventional EDM, a thermo-electrical process. WEDM process involves the erosion effect by rapid repetitive and discrete spark discharges between the <b>wire</b> <b>tool</b> electrode and work piece in a liquid dielectric medium. Manufacturing the parts of high quality at high production efficiency is the main objective of WEDM process. Selecting the appropriate machining parameter for high quality product is very difficult. Much research is not found in the field of WEDM to find the optimum parameter; in the present research, GRA is used to find the response variable of WEDM. An attempt is made by Majhi et al. (2013) for the determination of the optimal process parameters material removal rate, surface roughness and tool wear rate for EDM process. Modelling and optimisation of WEDM were given by Kumar and Kumar (2013). To find the optimum surface roughness, they used to input parameters such as Time On, Time Off, Wire Speed and Wire Feed. Taguchi techniques have been used for optimisation of minimizing the SR. Due to multiple variables, an extremely trained operator with a modern WEDM is rarely to achieve the optimal performance. Pasam et al. (2010) conducted research to solve this problem to determine the relation among the responses and its parameter. The most important responses in WEDM are metal removal rate, workpiece’s surface finish, and kerf width. Discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension, and dielectric flow rate are some of the machining parameters which affect the responses. The gap between the wire and work piece is also an important in wire EDM and it usually ranges from 0.02 to 0.075  mm given by Mahapatra and Patnaik (2007). Taguchi-based Grey relational analysis, to find the optimal process parameter setting for multi-matrix composite using molybdenum wire of 0.18  mm diameter, as electrode is applied by Lal et al. (2015). Similar technique for optimisation was used by Shivade and Shinde (2014) for D 3 tool steel material. Nayak and Mahapatra (2016) applied an artificial neural network (ANN) model to determine the relationship between input parameters and performance characteristics for taper cutting of deep cryo-treated Inconel 718 with cryo-treated coated Bronco cut-W. In wire electrical discharge machining process 0.2 mm diameter wire electrode was used. Jaganathan et al. (2012) optimised the wire EDM parameter and responses MRR and surface finish for EN 31 is done by Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array (OA). Singha and Pradhan (2014) conducted experiment through Taguchi method and response surface methodology is applied to estimate the optimum machining condition within the experimental constraints. Varun and Venkaiah (2014) used an optimisation strategy by coupling Grey relational analysis (GRA) with genetic algorithm (GA) to optimise the response parameters. Experiments were conducted on EN- 353 work material to study the effects of input parameters. Zinc-coated copper wire with 0.25 mm diameter is used as an electrode. The response parameter such as material removal rate (MRR), the surface roughness (SR), and kerf width is observed. Saha and Mondal (2016) applied an optimisation technique combining Grey relational analysis with principal component analysis to identify the optimal combination of process parameters in WEDM for machining nanostructured hard facing materials. Sinha et al. (2015) used Taguchi method for single objective optimisation and then the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios obtained from Taguchi method have been further used in principal component analysis (PCA) for multi-objective optimisation. Huang and Liao (2003) applied Grey relational analyses with L 18 mixed orthogonal array to determine the optimal selection of machining parameters for the wire electrical discharge machining process. Baig and Vankaiah (2001) applied Taguchi and Grey relation analysis to find the optimal parameter settings for WEDM for a nickel-based alloy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBrittle {{materials}} such as ceramics, glasses and oxide single crystals find increasing applications in advanced micro-engineering products. Machining small features in such materials represents a manufacturing challenge. Ultrasonic drilling constitutes a promising technique for realizing simple micro-holes of high diameter-to-depth ratio. The process involves impacting abrasive particles in suspension in a liquid slurry between tool and work piece. Among the process performance criteria, the drilling time (productivity) is one ofthe most important quantities to evaluate the suitability of theprocess for industrial applications. This paper summarizes recent results pertaining to the ultrasonic micro-drilling process obtained with a semi-industrial 3 -axis machine. The work piece is vibrated at 40 kHz frequency with an amplitude of several micrometers. A voice-coil actuator and a control loop based on the drilling force impose the tool feed. In addition, the tool is rotated at a prescribed speed to improve the drilling speed {{as well as the}} hole geometry. Typically, a WC <b>wire</b> serves as <b>tool</b> to bore 100 m and 200 m diameter micro-holes of 300 to 1, 000 m depth in glass and ruby.
