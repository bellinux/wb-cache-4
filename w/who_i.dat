5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am and what I want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E

5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, <b>who</b> <b>I</b> later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|E

5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
25|$|To promote <b>Who</b> <b>I</b> AM, he {{embarked}} on a tour to Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Dominican Republic and Mexico. In this last country, Mateo performed with Carlos Rivera at Teatro Metropólitan and with the Mexican boyband CD9 at Mexico City Arena. The <b>Who</b> <b>I</b> AM concert tour began in December 2014 in Barcelona and ended after nine months and almost 40 shows, including a big concert at Sports Palace, in Madrid. He held his first solo concerts in Mexico City, at Plaza Condesa, and Peru, and his second sold-out concert at legendary Luna Park arena, in Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|Poor Sir Ed, {{who is a}} quiz of {{the first}} magnitude, and <b>who</b> <b>I</b> believe had not given a dinner for twenty years before, was all bustle and anxiety during {{the whole of the}} entertainment.

25|$|It {{is such an}} {{interesting}} drama to see a nation create itself, that I – if I now had not been <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am – would go to America to follow up close every phase {{in the emergence of}} this new republic. – This perhaps is America's century. The new republic, which hardly has a population put together better than Rome had to begin with, may perhaps take advantage of Europe some day, {{in the same manner as}} Europe has taken advantage of America for two centuries.

25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer <b>who</b> <b>I</b> know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E
