50|$|Some ranches still heat {{branding}} irons in a wood or coal fire; {{others use}} an electric branding iron or electric sources to heat a traditional iron. Gas-fired branding iron heaters are quite popular in Australia, as iron temperatures can be regulated {{and there is}} not the heat of a nearby fire. Regardless of heating method, the iron is only applied for the amount of time needed to remove all hair and create a permanent mark. Branding irons are applied for a longer time to cattle than to horses, due to the differing thicknesses of their skins. If a brand is applied too long, it can damage the skin too deeply, thus requiring treatment for potential infection and longer-term healing. Branding <b>wet</b> <b>stock</b> may result in the smudging of the brand. Brand identification may be difficult on long-haired animals, and may necessitate clipping of the area to view the brand.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{papermaking}} techniques use a {{dandy roll}} {{to create the}} laid pattern {{during the early stages}} of manufacture, {{in the same way as}} applying a paper watermark. While in the wet state, the paper stock (a dilute dispersion of the cellulose fibers in water) is drained on a wire mesh to de-water the stock. During this process, a dandy roll with a laid mesh pattern is pressed into the <b>wet</b> <b>stock,</b> displacing the cellulose fiber. This pattern has to be applied at a particular stock consistency; otherwise the pattern will be lost as the fiber flows back while the stock moves past the dandy (too wet), or fiber will pick out of the stock (too dry), causing surface disruption. As the fiber is displaced, localized areas of higher and lower density are produced in a laid pattern, and the pattern is also created on the paper's surface. The pattern is therefore apparent both as one looks through the sheet and as one views its surface. Applying the laid pattern as a mechanical emboss would not create the ribbed pattern seen on looking through the sheet, as this is achieved only by watermarking techniques.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2007. The {{impact of}} change and {{transformation}} on small businesses has compelled them to face a multitude of new challenges. The successful application of the selected strategies depends largely on {{an understanding of the}} predisposing and prevailing business dynamics and variables that impacts on their profitability, continued sustainability and future growth. There is increased attention that is focused on the turnover factor of small business in South Africa and this gives added need for extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. International experience suggests that small businesses are a pervasive feature of the economic landscape in the developed world. The intensity and growing proportions of small business failure in South Africa is alarming. The problem not only presents management with new dilemmas, but also presents a challenge to researchers who are faced with the task of identifying through rational and scientifically valid processes, the underlying causes of the high failure rate amongst small businesses. Previous studies suggest that government regulations and franchised business have proven to be successful due to the infrastructure support offered by the franchisor. Since retail service station dealers operate within a highly regulated industry and within a franchised environment, this study examines the reasons for failure and success within the Retail Fuel Industry sector in South Africa. It was anticipated {{that there are a number}} of factors that influence success and failure from both within and outside the control of the fuel entrepreneur. While some researchers have identified gender, education levels and age as critical success factors, others suggested that management factors and occupational experience are key drivers. The fuel retail industry is regulated and seeks to reward efficiency through a retail fuel margin. This study provides new insights and important clues concerning the failure amongst fuel retailers. The closure of the business did not result in the physical disappearance of the establishment but rather in a transfer to new ownership. The purpose of this study is to conduct a more in-depth and comprehensive qualitative research using the case study methodology, which will investigate the causal factors that lead to the high mortality rate of fuel retailers in South Africa. The non-fuel aspect of the business comprises the shops and quick service restaurants and presents another dynamic to fuel retailing. This was investigated to fully address the research question. The case study analysis also attempted to quantify the level of support that franchisees received. There was sufficient evidence from the research findings to nullify the rival proposition that success and failure of fuel retailers was only a function of sales and volume. The case study evidence supported the research proposition that the reasons for failure and success were due to factors other than size. The 47 % per annum failure rate recorded in the study was attributed to a number of factors from both within and outside the control of the fuel entrepreneur. While gender, education levels and age were not found to be critical success factors, the ability to manage the key components of target costs was critical. The management of manpower costs and the efficient application thereof was found to be the most significant variable in the cost build up and differentiated successful and failed retailers. There was also evidence of substantial imposed costs from both the regulatory environment and the franchisor. The monthly adjustment of fuel prices had an impact on working capital and generally resulted in net stock price losses. Both these variables were not factored into the calculation of the retail fuel margin resulting in the understating of the true costs. The loose regulatory environment also marginalised the fuel retailer. It was found that the oil companies optimised their fuel delivery regimes at the expense of the small business owner through the automatic replenishment system of wet stocks, controlled through a central ordering system. While, <b>wet</b> <b>stock</b> control mechanism was in place for the fuel business, the non-fuel business received limited support for stock and shrinkage management. The case study evidence also supported the retailers view on the inadequate level of business support and training. This was an important finding and such poor orientation negatively influenced the quality of the due diligence checks and business valuation. In many cases, the budgeting was optimistic with little or no recourse for remedial action leading to eventual failure. Statistical analysis indicated that the two groups differed significantly with regard to the mean difference between Shop sales and Budgeted Shop sales. It appears that in the case of the success group that the shop sales mean was much higher than budgeted mean, while in the case of the failure group the mean was lower than budgeted mean. Failure to achieve the shop budgets did contribute to failure. Important recommendations are made based on the case study findings. This includes the establishment of a central training unit, an industry valuation model and a more relevant regulatory regime aimed at removing the imbalances between the oil company and the retailer in terms of delivery and payment methodology...|$|E
50|$|Pastoral {{farmers are}} {{also known as}} graziers (in Australia) {{and in some cases}} pastoralists (in a use of the term {{different}} from traditional nomadic livestock cultures). Pastoral farming is a non-nomadic form of pastoralism in which the livestock farmer has some form of ownership of the land used, giving the farmer more economic incentive to improve the land. Unlike other pastoral systems, pastoral farmers are sedentary and do not change locations in search for fresh resources. Rather, pastoral farmers adjust their pastures to fit the needs of their animals. Improvements include drainage (in <b>wet</b> regions), <b>stock</b> tanks (in dry regions), irrigation and sowing clover.|$|R

The impact of growing larvae and fry, with densities of 40 - 118 m- 2 at harvest, on zooplankton was conspicuous only after Day 22 when Daphnia became rare and calanoid numbers were suppressed. Predation by fry caused reductions {{in the size of}} Moina, cyclopoids and calanoids found. An increase in Daphnia size, 'gigantism', occurred because of limitations in the mouth gape of the fry. Low densities of fingerlings (0. 65 g <b>wet</b> weight and <b>stocked</b> at 1 and 2 m⁻²) had little effect on zooplankton succession, whereas high density (15 fingerlings m⁻²) caused a shift to a zooplankton community dominated by small cladocerans, rotifers and cyclopoids. High fingerling density also caused a reduction {{in the size of the}} microcrustaceans found. The size and density of fish determined their impact on zooplankton composition and succession, demonstrating that similar starting times and consistency in fish density are necessary in obtaining 'sensible' statistical inferences in field fish-zooplankton experiments...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the nutritional composition of the intertidal marine polychaete Perinereis helleri (Nereididae) when artificially cultured in sand filters treating mariculture wastewater. Moisture levels in harvested P. helleri ranged from 758 to 855 g kg 1, and ash, from 23 to 61 g kg 1 <b>wet</b> matter (WM). <b>Stocking</b> density and graded size after harvest significantly affected their composition. Higher total lipid contents were found in large (> 0. 6 g) P. helleri(16 – 19 g kg 1 WM) and those grown at the lowest density(1000 m 2 : 18 g kg 1 WM) than in small (≤ 0. 6 g) ones (14 g kg 1 WM) and those grown at the highest densities (4000 – 6000 m 2 : 13 – 16 g kg 1 WM). Several fatty acids within a very broad profile (some 30 identified) reflected this pattern, yet their ARA/EPA/DHA ratios were relatively unaffected. Feeding the polychaete-assisted sand filters (PASF) with fish meal to increase worm biomass productivity significantly increased their DHA content. Other components (e. g. protein, phospholipids, cholesterol, carbohydrate, amino acids, nitrogen, minerals and bromophenols) and nutritional factors (e. g. maturity, feeding seaweed and endemic shrimp viral content) were also investigated. Results suggest that PASF-produced P. helleri have a well-balanced nutritional profile for penaeid shrimp and fish broodstock...|$|R

Twelve 3 m x 2 m x 2 m suspension nets made of nylon cloth (mesh size = 0. 1 mm) were set up in a Leganes Station pond (ave. water depth = 1 m) by means of 3 -m long poles stacked at distances approximating the area of each net. The net bottom was filled with topsoil at least 15 cm thick to stimulate the pond bottom. At least 60 cm of the upper edge of each net was above the water level to prevent mixing of water inside and outside the net. P. monodon of stages P 11, P 15, P 21 (from the hatchery) and P 25 (from the <b>wet</b> lab) were <b>stocked</b> in the nets at 200 /sq m or 1, 200 fry/net. Due to lack of fry, only one P 25 net was stocked. Each net had two large dried miapi branches as shelter from predation and cannibalism for the young sugpo fry. Fresh lablab was fed at the rate of one pail (approximately 5 kg) every four days per net. Harvest data show relatively higher survival rates for P 15 and P 18 compared to P 11 and P 25 with no significant difference between these two stages. The results for P 25 may not be valid because the stock came from the wet lab in comparison to the other postlarval stages which were reared in the hatchery. Moreover, the P 25 stock had no replicates and the net itself (no. 10) was discovered to have many holes. These preliminary results point to P 15 as the best stage for harvest from the hatchery in terms of high pond recovery and lesser expense in rearing compared to older postlarvae...|$|R

40|$|There is {{uncertainty}} over the potential changes to rainfall across northern Australia under climate change. Since rainfall {{is a key}} driver of pasture growth, cattle numbers and the resulting animal productivity and beef business profitability, the ability to anticipate possible management strategies within such uncertainty is crucial. The Climate Savvy Grazing project used existing research, expert knowledge and computer modelling to explore the best-bet management strategies within best, median and worse-case future climate scenarios. All three scenarios indicated changes {{to the environment and}} resources upon which the grazing industry of northern Australia depends. Well-adapted management strategies under a changing climate are very similar to best practice within current climatic conditions. Maintaining good land condition builds resource resilience, maximises opportunities under higher rainfall years and reduces the risk of degradation during drought and failed <b>wet</b> seasons. Matching <b>stocking</b> rate to the safe long-term carrying capacity of the land is essential; reducing stock numbers in response to poor seasons and conservatively increasing stock numbers in response to better seasons generally improves profitability and maintains land in good condition. Spelling over the summer growing season will improve land condition under a changing climate as it does under current conditions. Six regions were included within the project. Of these, the Victoria River District in the Northern Territory, Gulf country of Queensland and the Kimberley region of Western Australia had projections of similar or higher than current rainfall and the potential for carrying capacity to increase. The Alice Springs, Maranoa-Balonne and Fitzroy regions had projections of generally drying conditions and the greatest risk of reduced pasture growth and carrying capacity. Encouraging producers to consider and act on the risks, opportunities and management options inherent in climate change was a key goal of the project. More than 60, 000 beef producers, advisors and stakeholders are now more aware of the management strategies which build resource resilience, and that resilience helps buffer against the effects of variable and changing climatic conditions. Over 700 producers have stated they have improved confidence, skills and knowledge to attempt new practices to build resilience. During the course of the project, more than 165 beef producers reported they have implemented changes to build resource and business resilience...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary. In {{this report}} we analyse {{implementation}} {{costs and benefits}} for agricultural management practices, grouped into farming systems. In order to do so, we compare plot scale gross margins for the dominant agricultural production systems (sugarcane, grazing and banana cultivation) in the NRM regions Wet Tropics, Burdekin Dry Tropics and Mackay Whitsundays. Furthermore, where available, we present investment requirements for changing to improved farming systems. It {{must be noted that}} transaction costs are not captured within this project. For sugarcane, this economic analysis shows that there are expected benefits to sugarcane growers in the different regions through transitions to C and B class farming systems. Further transition to A-class farming systems can come at a cost, depending on the capital investment required and the length of the investment period. Obviously, the costs and benefits will vary for each individual grower and will depend on their starting point and individual property scenario therefore each circumstance needs to be carefully considered before making a change in management practice. In grazing, overall, reducing stocking rates comes at a cost (reduced benefits). However, when operating at low utilisation rates in <b>wetter</b> country, lowering <b>stocking</b> rates can potentially come at a benefit. With win-win potential, extension is preferred to assist farmer in changing management practices to improve their land condition. When reducing stocking rates comes at a cost, incentives may be applicable to support change among farmers. For banana cultivation, the results indicate that the transition to C and B class management practices is a worthwhile proposition from an economic perspective. For a change from B to A class farming systems however, it is not worthwhile from a financial perspective. This is largely due to the large capital investment associated with the change in irrigation system and negative impact in whole of farm gross margin. Overall, benefits will vary for each individual grower depending on their starting point and their individual property scenario. The results presented in this report are one possible set of figures to show the changes in profitability of a grower operating in different management classes. The results in this report are not prescriptive of every landholder. Landholders will have different costs and benefits from transitioning to improved practices, even if similar operations are practiced, hence it is recommended that landholders that are willing to change management undertake their own research and analysis into the expected costs and benefits for their own soil types and property circumstances...|$|R
40|$|This {{base line}} {{as well as}} {{comprehensive}} study about the productive potential of grasses in Cholistan desert was conducted for two consecutive years from 2009 to 2010. The {{aim of this study}} was to study the floristic composition, vegetation structure, biomass production, carrying capacity, palatability and nutritional evaluation of grass species. Based on our findings, total 27 grass species consisting of 16 genera, belonging to family Poaceae were identified. The documented grasses comprised of 13 annuals species and 14 perennials species whereas therophyte was dominant life form including 16 grass species followed by hemicrytophytes with 09 species and phanerophytes with 02 species. Abundance of grasses showed that 06 grass species were found very common, 14 were common and 07 species were rare. In current study, two phenological seasons were recognized from the Cholistan desert. First season started from February and ended in May while second phenological season was from August to December. Maximum grass species were found to be flowering during the second spell as compare to first one. Further, based on economic use classification it was observed that all 27 grasses were being used as fodder/forage while 05 species were used as medicine in the investigated area. Based on phytosociological study, twenty grass communities were identified from selected range sites. However, multivariate analysis has produce three major vegetation groups i. e. interdunal, sandunal and clayey saline group. The soil texture of sandunal group was sandy, interdunal group was sandy loam whereas clayey saline group was clayey. Moreover, it was observed that fluctuations in rainfall pattern influenced the biomass productivity of range grasses in the study area. There was high biomass production in wet season (8068 Kg/ha) as compared to dry season (5595 Kg/ha). Following the biomass productivity of grasses, overall carrying capacity of rangelands of Cholistan desert was 24. 20 ha/AU/year during dry season and 17. 25 ha/AU/year in <b>wet</b> season. However, <b>stocking</b> rate varied from 0. 041 AU/ha/year in dry season to 0. 057 AU/ha/year in wet season. In this study, degree of palatability showed that all the identified grass species were palatable. Out of which 18 grass species were highly palatable while 07 were moderately palatable and 02 were less palatable species. Among 27 palatable grass species 25 species (92. 6 %) were used by goats, 26 species (96. 3 %) were used by sheep and cattle, and camel were using only 07 grass species (25. 9 %). It was noted that flower and fruit parts of grasses were grazed in 14 species (51. 8 %) and 08 species (29. 8 %) respectively, whereas in 26 species (96. 3 %) leaves were used and in 23 species (85. 1 %) stem parts were grazed. Similarly, nutritional evaluation consisting of chemical, structural, and mineral analysis of major range grasses was conducted. Results showed that grasses were good source of dry matter and crude protein but deficient in other nutrients and remained fail to meet the animal requirements for optimum livestock production in Cholistan rangelands. Overall, this study showed that the investigated rangeland is less productive and needs proper management and rehabilitation through ecological approaches. There is a need that Government should give complete protection to this rangeland and provide alternate resource of energy to lessen the burden on this area. It is recommended that low stocking rate during growing seasons and moderate stocking rate during dry spell by proper livestock management technique improve range biomass, species diversity, and rangeland carrying capacity. This all would be possible with the participation of local people/pastoralist and Government to make the resources sustainable...|$|R
