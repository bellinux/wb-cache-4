5|$|As Typhoon Meranti never {{threatened}} any land masses, no watches or warnings {{were issued}} {{in response to}} the storm. Although Meranti passed near <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> as a tropical depression, no effects were recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Ma-on were {{from an area}} of {{convection}} that meandered near <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> on July 9. The disturbance slowly consolidated and developed a low-level circulation. Based {{on the presence of}} low wind shear and generally favorable environmental conditions, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that the system would develop into a tropical cyclone. Early on July 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and a few hours later the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported the formation of a tropical depression about halfway between <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> and the Northern Marianas Islands. The JTWC followed suit and initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 08W.|$|E
5|$|Captain Marion Frederic Ramírez de Arellano, (1913–1980) USN, {{the first}} Hispanic {{submarine}} commanding officer, participated in five war patrols. He led {{the effort to}} rescue five navy pilots and one enlisted gunner off <b>Wake</b> <b>Island,</b> {{and contributed to the}} sinking of two Japanese freighters and damaging a third. For his actions, he was awarded a Silver Stars Medal and a Legion of Merit Medal.|$|E

5000|$|... 20 August 1944: VP-23 was {{deployed}} {{to the island}} of Eniwetok. From this naval air base searches were conducted to the northern and western approaches of the island. Periodic reconnaissance flights were conducted to Ponape and <b>Wake</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 6-17 March 1945: VPB-19 was {{transferred}} back to Parry Island, Eniwetok, based ashore with a detachments aboard various tenders. The squadron returned to combat operations consisting of sector searches, hunter-killer patrols and Dumbo missions {{in the vicinity}} of Ponape and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|R
5|$|In mid-October, in {{response}} to suspicions of planned American raids on <b>Wake</b> <b>Island,</b> Musashi led a large fleet—three carriers, six battleships, and 11 cruisers—to intercept American forces, but failed to make contact and returned to Truk on 26 October. She spent the remainder of 1943 in Truk Lagoon. Captain Komura was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and transferred to the 3rd Fleet on 7 December as Chief of Staff, Captain Bunji Asakura assuming command of Musashi.|$|E
5|$|Lexington was at sea {{when the}} Pacific War began on 7 December 1941, {{ferrying}} fighter aircraft to Midway Island. Her mission was cancelled and {{she returned to}} Pearl Harbor a week later. After a few days, she was sent to create a diversion from the force en route to relieve the besieged <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands. The island was forced to surrender before the relief force got close enough, and the mission was cancelled. A planned attack on <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> in January 1942 had to be cancelled when a submarine sank the oiler required to supply the fuel for the return trip. Lexington {{was sent to the}} Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area. The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul, New Britain, and her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her. Together with the carrier , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March.|$|E
5|$|Next, Radford and his {{carriers}} {{took part}} in an air attack and cruiser bombardment of <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> on 5 to 6 October 1943. He shifted his flag to Lexington for the operation, which took two days. Though the effects on Japanese positions were not known, Radford and other leaders considered the operations useful for preparing their forces for the major battles {{to come in the}} Central Pacific.|$|E
5000|$|... 25 January 1945: VPB-26 {{departed}} NAS Kaneohe Bay for NAB Parry Island, Eniwetok. The squadron {{operated under}} the operational control of TG 96.1, conducting searches, reconnaissance, Dumbo (air-sea rescue) missions, convoy escort and hunter-killer missions. Occasional reconnaissance flights were conducted over enemy-held Ponape and <b>Wake</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction, Bruce Willis's {{grandfather}} {{was one of}} <b>Wake</b> <b>Island's</b> defenders in 1941, managing to smuggle his wristwatch out to his son before the island fell to the Japanese. The story is recounted to Willis' character, Butch Coolidge, by Captain Koons, played by Christopher Walken.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, MK built airfields, storage depots, and bases {{throughout}} the Pacific and built ships along the American West Coast. Japanese forces captured 1,200 workers, including many MK employees, stationed on Midway and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands</b> in late 1941. After the war MK expanded into {{a variety of}} foreign construction fields.|$|R
5|$|On 17 October 1943, Haruna again left Truk {{as part of}} an {{even larger}} force—five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and {{numerous}} destroyers—in response to American raids on <b>Wake</b> <b>Island.</b> When no contact was made the force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. On 16 December 1943, she arrived at Sasebo for refits and inland-sea training.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 1954 {{the airline}} began {{international}} flights, carrying 18 passengers from Tokyo to San Francisco on a Douglas DC-6B City of Tokyo via <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> and Honolulu. The flights between Tokyo and San Francisco are still Flights 1 and 2, to commemorate its first international service. The early flights were advertised as being operated by American crews and serviced by United Air Lines in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{storm of}} the season was Hurricane Ioke, which reached Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale in the central Pacific Ocean; Ioke passed near Johnston Atoll and later <b>Wake</b> <b>Island,</b> where it caused heavy damage but no deaths.

2500|$|During {{the task}} unit's retirement, TheSullivans refueled from [...] {{and arrived at}} Majuro on 4 May. Ten days later, TG58.2 sortied again, bound for Marcus and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands.</b> Launching the first raid at 08:00 on the 19th, the American {{carriers}} kept up nearly continuous air strikes with no enemy interruptions for three days. En route back to Majuro, TheSullivans and her sister destroyers conducted a thorough but unsuccessful search for a suspected submarine.|$|R
5|$|In early July, {{widespread}} {{showers and}} thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July9, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> became {{associated with the}} TUTT and quickly organized. By July11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320km (200mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a cold-core low.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid {{was ordered}} to relieve Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher as {{commander}} of Cruiser Division 6, consisting of the heavy cruisers , Minneapolis and San Francisco. This {{was part of the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet, based at Pearl Harbor. He did not reach his new command until after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the U.S. into the war. When he reached Hawaii, Kinkaid stayed with his brother-in-law, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was married to Kinkaid's sister Dorothy. Kinkaid accompanied Fletcher as an observer during the attempt to relieve <b>Wake</b> <b>Island,</b> and did not formally assume command of the division until 29 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|Oliwa passed {{south of}} <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> on September 6, where it caused heavy rains but no damage. On September 7, Oliwa started {{a period of}} rapid strengthening, {{becoming}} a typhoon on September 8 and a Super Typhoon eight hours later. Oliwa stayed at that intensity for over two days. While still a strong typhoon, Oliwa passed near the Northern Marianas Islands. It then started weakening as it curved towards Japan. It made landfall as a minimal typhoon September 16. It quickly dissipated later that same day. Typhoon Oliwa caused 12fatalities and left 30,000people homeless. Damage totaled to 4.36billion yen ($50.1million USD).|$|E
50|$|On 10 February 1945, {{the carrier}} got {{underway}} to join TG 52.2, {{which had been}} established to provide air cover and support while escorting major units to the Volcano Islands and then to furnish naval gunfire, spotting, and direct air support for landing forces. The following day, she steamed to an area off Saipan-Tinian where rehearsals for the invasion took place. On 13 February, <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands</b> commanding officer was designated OTC of Task Unit 52.2.1 (TU 52.2.1).|$|R
50|$|The event {{generated}} a large tsunami {{that was as}} high as 47 ft and was detected in Alaska, California, Japan, Okinawa, Samoa, and on Johnston and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands.</b> Significant changes to the shorelines along the southern coast of the Big Island with subsidence of 12 ft was observed, causing some areas to be permanently submerged. The source of the event was the Hilina Slump, which was also responsible for the more powerful 1868 Hawaii earthquake and tsunami.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the task}} units retirement, The Sullivans refueled from [...] {{and arrived at}} Majuro on 4 May.

5|$|On 17 October 1943, Kongō again left Truk {{as part of}} {{a larger}} task force {{consisting}} of five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and numerous destroyers. These sortied in response to U.S. Navy air raids on <b>Wake</b> <b>Island.</b> No contact between the two forces was made, and the Japanese task force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. She soon left Truk for home waters, and on 16 December 1943, Kongō arrived at Sasebo for refits and training in the Inland Sea.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December 1941, the Japanese {{attacked}} the U.S. Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, initiating {{a state of}} war between the two nations. The attack crippled much of the U.S. battleship fleet. The initial goals of Japanese leaders in the war were to neutralize the U.S. fleet, seize possessions rich in natural resources, and establish strategic military bases to defend Japan's empire in Asia and the Pacific. In support of these goals, Japanese forces attacked and took control of the Philippines, Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, <b>Wake</b> <b>Island,</b> Gilbert Islands, New Britain, and Guam.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E
50|$|She was recommissioned 5 June 1934 {{and cleared}} Bremerton 21 June for her base at San Pedro. For the {{following}} six years she cruised along the United States West Coast supplying oil and gasoline to ports in the Panama Canal Zone, the Caribbean, and Hawaii. In 1941 Kanawha widened her operations, sailing east to Midway and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands</b> {{and as far}} north as Alaska. The oiler was at Mare Island undergoing overhaul {{at the time of the}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of in flight refueling tactics. On 6 July 1952 the wing executed Operation Fox Peter One, the mass movement of the entire wing from Turner Field to Misawa Air Base, Japan using aerial refueling to fly non-stop from Turner to Travis Air Force Base, California, and from Travis to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. The unit then island-hopped across {{the rest of the}} Pacific with stops at Midway and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands,</b> Eniwetok Atoll, Guam, Iwo Jima and Yokota Air Base, Japan.|$|R
50|$|Arriving at Bethlehem Steel Company Fore River Yard near Boston, Massachusetts, Sprague took {{command of}} Wasp {{where she was}} {{commissioned}} on November 24, 1943. The carrier was quickly sent to the Pacific where she joined {{the war against the}} Japanese. Her first combat missions were to destroy enemy aircraft, installations, and surface craft on Marcus and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands</b> in May 1944. In June 1944 Wasp participated in the invasion of Saipan and the Battle of the Philippine Sea. On July 9, 1944, shortly before leaving Wasp, Sprague was promoted to rear admiral at age 48.|$|R
5|$|The Vinson-Trammell Act of 1934 set up {{a regular}} program of ship {{building}} and modernization to bring the Navy to the maximum size allowed by treaty. The Navy's preparation was helped along by another Navy assistant secretary turned president, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The naval limitation treaties also applied to bases, but Congress only approved building seaplane bases on <b>Wake</b> <b>Island,</b> Midway Island and Dutch Harbor and rejected any additional funds for bases on Guam and the Philippines. Navy ships were designed with greater endurance and range which allowed them to operate further from bases and between refits.|$|E
5|$|After her June 1891 commissioning, Bennington was {{attached}} to the Squadron of Evolution and for its cruise to South America. The gunboat made two Mediterranean tours between 1892 and 1894, after which she was assigned to the duties in the Pacific. She sailed the Pacific coasts of North and Central America and spent time in the Hawaiian Islands to protect American interests there. On her way to support United States Army operations of the Philippine–American War, Bennington claimed <b>Wake</b> <b>Island</b> for the United States. After two years in the Philippines, she returned to the United States and was decommissioned for 18months of repairs and refitting. After her March 1903 re-commissioning, most of the next two years were spent patrolling the Pacific coasts of North and South America.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{he served}} at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, where he was {{involved}} in an effort to improve aircraft instrumentation, notably the compass and altimeter. He attended the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering, and studied nuclear physics. In June 1942, he assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with PB4Y-1 Liberators, which he led in a daring raid on <b>Wake</b> <b>Island,</b> in the Solomon Islands campaign, and in the Southwest Pacific Area. Returning to the United States in 1944, he was posted was to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California, where he joined the Manhattan Project, participating in Project Camel, the development of the non-nuclear components of the Fat Man bomb, and in its drop testing.|$|E
50|$|The Fleet entered Panay Gulf about 100 miles (160 km) {{northwest}} of Manila. <b>Wake</b> <b>Island's</b> surface search radar was jammed by enemy transmission, and the escort carrier went to general quarters at 1714. One minute later, a Japanese single-engine plane appeared overhead in a steep diving attack on , some 4200 yd away. Fire immediately flared from that carrier's flight and hangar decks, and after 20 minutes, her crew abandoned Ommaney Bay under a dense cloud of black smoke. She burned with explosions of ammunition and was finally scuttled astern {{of the fleet}} by a torpedo from an American destroyer.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 March, the carriers, {{supported}} by battleships and cruisers and screened by {{a ring of}} destroyers, departed the atoll with Owen in the outer ring of steel.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the US {{was not yet}} {{actively}} involved in fighting World War II, but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of Naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. Following standard peacetime patterns the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These privately owned constructions firms employed native civilian populations as well as Americans. These firms were answerable to Navy officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large navy bases were being built in Guam, Midway and <b>Wake</b> <b>Islands,</b> Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad, in addition to many other places.|$|R
