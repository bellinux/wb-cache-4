50|$|Proper {{cleaning}} produces higher-quality oil. Grindstones, while ancient in design, are {{a suitable}} way to grind olives, because this method breaks up the drupe's pulp while only slightly touching the nut and the skin. This reduces {{the release of}} the oil oxidation enzymes present in these organs. In addition, in this extraction method, the introduction of water is minimal when compared to the modern one, thus reducing the <b>washing-off</b> of the polyphenols. The exhausted paste, called pomace, has a low content of water, making it an easier residue to manage.|$|E
40|$|Dyeing {{cellulosic}} fibres with reactive dyes wastes great {{quantities of}} salt and water. The objective of this work is to dye cellulosic fibers using coloured nanoparticles (CNPs) {{as an alternative to}} dyeing with reactive dyes, without salt and with only a short <b>washing-off</b> procedure at the end of dyeing. Samples of cotton were dyed by exhaustion with CNPs at light to medium colours. Washfastness results are given. Complete <b>Washing-off</b> sequence after dyeing was not necessary for the red and yellow colours, only one rinsing. The blue colour needs some washing off since the fastness is lower than for the other colours even though soaping is not necessary, saving energy and time relative to dyeing with reactive dyes.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{types of}} plants (lettuce and radish) were {{contaminated}} by dry deposition of radioactive aerosols (137 Cs, 85 Sr, 133 Ba and 123 mTe). Due {{to the rain}} efficiency in decreasing radiological contamination of crops, a rain scenario was applied on {{the two types of}} plants. These experiments aimed at improving the prediction of the consequences on agricultural products of a nuclear accident occurring on a PWR, and at improving the understanding of the different processes occurring between contamination and harvest. For a plant species at a given stage of its growth cycle, the interception of the four radionuclides was found to be identical and varied from 68 % for radish to 75 % (at the middle of ripeness stage) or 78 % (at the mature plant stage). Using a conceptual model, the predominance between the two processes- <b>washing-off</b> the leaves and absorption through the leaves cuticles allowing translocation- was evidenced. For Cs, Sr and Ba, for both the lettuce and the radish, <b>washing-off</b> on the foliar cover was the most significant during the first rain. The absorption process inside the plant became dominant only from the third rain event. Tellurium had a particular behaviour: it was non-mobile and stayed put on the leaves. The values of the <b>washing-off</b> and absorption coefficients were estimated. The global transfer factor values were dependant on both the radionuclides and the plant species; nevertheless, a higher value was obtained for cesium, regardless of the plant and the rainfall (from 0. 06 m. kgfresh- 1 for radish to 0. 1 m. kgfresh- 1 for a whole lettuce). 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCationic {{peptides}} {{could be}} successfully {{released from a}} precursor protein bound to a cation-exchange membrane by in-situ enzymatic cleavage with an appropriate enzyme. This procedure allows the <b>washing-off</b> of other hydrolytic fragments from the membrane before the selective removal of the strongly bound target peptide(s) at increased pH or with high ionic strength buffer. Two new applications of this method are presented. The lantibiotic nisin could be released with high efficiency by tryptic hydrolysis of its precursor polypeptide bound to the ionic membrane. Further, {{the production of a}} fraction enriched in a novel antibacterial domain from the N-terminal part of caprine lactoferrin is reported. Characterisation of this domain by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that this peptide corresponded to fragment 14 - 42 of the sequence of mature caprine lactoferrin, here referred to as lactoferricin-C. Thus, the purification procedure shown can be used to isolate cationic peptides initially produced in a longer, inactive form by bacteria (fusion proteins) or naturally occurring antibacterial peptides generated by the digestion of proteins...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{silicone}} chemistry {{have led}} {{in recent years}} {{to the development of a}} wide variety of compounds derived from the basic structure of siloxane bond polymers, with properties uch as chemical inertia, heat resistance, and lack of systemic toxicity. Because these compounds do not cause sensitization or irritation of the skin or eyes, they are excipients of choice in skin-care products and drugs. The advantages of silicone emulsions are that they can be prepared at room temperature, have adequate xtensibility, and do not leave a greasy, sticky, or unctuous film on the skin. Physical stability assays (centrifugation and aging at 25 øC, 40 øC, and 60 øC) yielded similar results. Rheological assays, tests at different pH values, and droplet size studies were also done. Stability of the preparation was adequate: droplets remained small and homogeneous, and did not increase in size because of coalescence during the assay. pH showed minimal variations, and remained within the range of 6. 5 - 7. Different centrifugation assays were used, none of which led to breakdown of the emulsion. Because of their hydrophobic nature, silicones impart substantiveness to the preparation. This was confirmed experimentally in <b>washing-off</b> tests, used because the final product was intended for use by swimmers exposed to natural sunlight. After 24 h of testing, an acceptable percentage of the initial concentration of solar filter remained present in the formulation...|$|E
40|$|The dyeing {{of cotton}} can be {{problematic}} to the dyeing industry when dyeing with different dye classes because {{a significant amount}} of dyes find their way into effluents. Cotton dyed with different class of dyes suffers from <b>washing-off,</b> wash-fastness, light-fastness, rubfastness and ring-dyeing problems. A method to increase the substantivity for the cotton fiber is to create a positive charge on the fiber. For this purpose the cotton fiber was pretreated with cationising agents Servon XRK and NMM derivative. Servon XRK and NMM derivative were used as part of EU Frame Work V. Servon XRK (3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxy-N, N, N-trimethyl-l-propanaminium chloride) and NMM derivative [4 -(3 -chloro- 2 - hydroxypropyl) - 4 -methylmorpholin- 4 -ium chloride) ] were applied to cotton by pad-batch method. In this research vat dyes, acid dyes, azoic colourants and reactive dyes have been used. The dyeings from vat dyes gave improved colour yield values when applied to the Servon XRK and NMM modified cotton fabrics as compared to the unmodified cotton fabrics. The dyeings from anthraquinone vat dyes (Cl Vat Violet 1, Cl Vat Red 13 and Cl Vat Green 1) on modified (Servon XRK and NMM) cotton fabric absolutely did not lose any colour in wash-off liquor as the dyeings from anthraquinone vat dyes (Cl Vat Violet 1, Cl Vat Red 13 and Cl Vat Green 1) on the unmodified cotton fabric gave {{a significant amount of}} colour in wash-off liquor. Vat dyes on the modified cotton fabric gave overall better dyeing results than on the unmodified cotton fabric. Disulphonated acid dyes Cl Acid Red 13 and Cl Acid Red 17 gave better wash-fastness results than monosulphonated (Cl Acid Red 88) and trisulphonated (Cl Acid Red 18 and Cl Acid Red 27). The light-fastness results were better for the dyeings from trisulphonated acid dyes than the monosulphonated and disulphonated acid dyes. The dyeings from Cl Acid Blue 193 gave good dyeing results than the dyeings from Cl Acid Violet 92. The overall dyeing results are better for the dyeings obtained by the application o f Naphthol AS to the Servon XRK modified cotton fabric by pad-dry and pad-batch-dry methods followed by coupling than the corresponding dyeings on the unmodified cotton fabric. Sumifix Supra Blue BRF and Sumifix Supra Red 3 BF applied on the Servon XRK modified cotton fabric gave improved dyeing results than applying on unmodified cotton fabric. Reactive dyes co-applied with NMM have given overall better results than when applied without NMM. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
