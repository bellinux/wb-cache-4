There was, it seemed, no mercy shown to weaklings in the arena he had rashly entered with none of the weapons that the command of money supplied to those pitted against him; but in place of shrinking from the conflict a slow, smoldering rage crept into his heart.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the construction of}} place for tourists at Port Arthur, Tasmania, Australia, between 1885 and 1960. Port Arthur, a popular Tasmanian tourist destination today, was first established in 1830 as a secondary punishment station for British convicts and closed in 1877. Six months following its closure, the first steamship full of pleasure-seekers interested in visiting the former penal settlement arrived at Port Arthur. While some groups in Tasmania worked to shed the stain of its convict past, tourist interest in Port Arthur increased. The substantial income tourism introduced to a limited local economy resulted in tensions between hiding the convict past and profiting from it. The <b>way</b> <b>Port</b> Arthur was created and recreated for tourists changed through time and was often affected by context. Constructions of the site and its history were driven {{by a number of}} fiscal, social and cultural factors, and these were navigated by several groups. A number of actors, including hotel proprietors, tour operators, postcard producers, museum curators and guidebook authors, had varied roles and interests in the site, and these were enacted in a variety of media. To explore some of the nuances in the ways Port Arthur was constructed for tourists, material culture from several contexts around the site was examined. This includes assemblages from hotels and guesthouses at Port Arthur, advertisements for the hotels printed in newspapers and guidebooks, postcards which depicted the site, and private museum collections that interpreted the site for visitors. These collections were examined for expressions of dark tourism and romanticism, along with broader understandings of authenticity and inauthenticity in the construction of Port Arthur for tourists. Evidence from all available contexts at Port Arthur was used (where possible) to evaluate historical theories regarding the development of mass tourism in the western world. Artefact assemblages from hotels and guesthouses at Port Arthur were also used to assess existing theories about the material nature of tourism as a phenomenon, identify a material signature unique to tourist sites and better understand material manifestations of tourism...|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{variegated}} means {{through which}} ports {{have become increasingly}} entangled in the planning logic of neoliberal innovation-driven economy. The research topic belongs to the academic disciplines of economics and human geography. The aim of the thesis is to analyse how the notion of innovation, adopted {{in a variety of}} supranational and national port policy documents, is deployed in operational port environment in two different ports of the Baltic Sea Region: the port of Stockholm, Sweden, and the port of Klaipeda, Lithuania. This novel innovation agenda is visible in several topics I examine in the study, that is, port governance, environmental issues, and seaport – port-city interface. The gathered primary source material on port policy documents, strategies, development planning documents and reports is analysed by utilizing the qualitative content analysis research method. Moreover, the empirical part of the case study, that is, tracing innovation practices in mundane port activities is based on collected qualitative semi-structured interviews with port authorities in Klaipeda and Stockholm, researchers and other port experts. I examine the interview material by employing the theoretical reading research method. In my analysis, I have reframed port-related policy development by tracing and identifying the port transformation from “functional terminals” to “engines for growth”. My results show that this novel innovation-oriented rhetoric imprinted in the narrative “engines for growth” is often contested in daily port practices. In other words, my analysis reveals that the port authorities’ and other port actors’ attitudes towards innovations do not necessarily correspond to the new narrative of innovation and do not always “fit” within a framework of neoliberal economic thinking that glorifies the “culture of innovations”. I argue that the ability to develop innovative initiatives in the ports of Klaipeda and Stockholm is strongly predetermined by local conditions, a port’s governance model, the <b>way</b> <b>port</b> actors perceive the importance of innovations per se, demand factors and new regulations...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Greater {{participation}} {{in international trade}} is {{an essential element of}} economic growth. Trade and transport facilitation (TTF) measures and instruments are seen as important initiatives to smooth the progress of trade volumes. The measurement of TTF performance provides the basis for the development of initiatives aimed at accelerating the flow of goods across borders as well as optimising customs processes. A key problem is that there is neither uniformity nor standard frameworks or methodologies for measuring the operations performance of trade and transport facilitation. This scenario leads us to the following questions: which performance factors can be considered as general key operational elements for the facilitation of trade and transport? Can these factors be expressed in terms of performance objectives that are strategic for operations in general? This study focused upon operational aspects of TTF. Its main purpose was to identify and categorise factors that represent key operations performance aspects on the field. Research approach: The research approach used to identify key TTF performance factors was Delphi study. This method was adopted because it allows the achievement of reliable consensus on complex issues, in circumstances where accurate information does not exist or is impossible to obtain economically. It also allows reliable and creative exploration of ideas {{as the basis for the}} production of suitable information for decision making. Delphi technique is an exercise of group communication interspersed with controlled opinion feedback involving a panel of geographically dispersed experts. In order to avoid influences, the group interaction in Delphi is anonymous. A knowledgeable group of eleven academics, consultants, and practitioners with large experience in the area of global logistics and supply chain management formed the group of experts in this study. Findings and Originality: This paper reports the findings of a Delphi study involved in a research project funded by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) UK. Critical operations performance elements such as speed, dependability, flexibility, quality, and cost provided the basis for the categorisation of the key TTF performance factors identified in the study. Those performance elements are well established performance aspects in the operations management discipline. This classification framework provides clarification, sound referential basis, and a more structured and consistent way to represent key performance factors on TTF operations. Research impact: The framework developed in this study can be a useful reference for regional comparisons, helping the assessment of trade and transport facilitation operations performance at port and country level. The study also contributes to the definition of more standardised indicators that can potentially assist in designing and implementing effective and targeted programs to increase agility, dependability, flexibility, quality, and lower the cost of moving goods and services across borders. Finally, it provides a basis for the development of further indicators for the analysis of performance aspect of trade and transport facilitation, as well as a basis for the development of further studies involving comparative analysis of operations performance aspects in the field. Practical impact: The main outcome of the study provides a useful managerial framework for the analysis of the performance of trade and transport facilitation at the operational level. In practical terms, the framework can be used as a basis for monitoring, benchmarking, and detecting specific areas with poor operational performance. This <b>way,</b> <b>port</b> managers and government customs officers can develop more targeted and straightforward initiatives to improve the agility (speed), reliability (dependability), responsiveness (flexibility), quality, and cost effectiveness of their trade and transport facilitation processes. The framework can also be used as a common reference for the comparison of the operational performance of different ports, supporting strategic decisions such as government prioritisation plans to improve the infrastructure of ports with poor performance as well as logistics service providers' decisions to operate, or not, with a particular port...|$|E
