[...] Charles was surprised by Bobby's paralysis storyline, but became [...] "really interested" [...] in finding out how it would affect him. However, she posited, [...] "The guy's a spitfire...and it probably won't change him much." [...] IGN's Diana Steenbergen also praised Beaver, calling Bobby [...] "a valuable member of the team" [...] that [...] "broadens [...] tight-knit unit, reminding them that there is more to family than just blood ties". She found the actor to be [...] "fantastic as the broken Bobby" [...] in the fifth season, [...] "despondent over his situation and feeling useless". Steenbergen noted, [...] "Bobby has been through a lot this season, and Jim Beaver has done an outstanding job portraying his journey. Not solely a surrogate father figure and keeper of random supernatural knowledge, this season Bobby has run the gamut of sacrifice, loss, anger, and determination to keep fighting." [...] After watching Bobby confess his suicidal thoughts to Dean in [...] "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester", she felt that [...] "Beaver conveys all of Bobby's vulnerability and also the shame that comes from being reprimanded by Dean for wanting to give up".|$|E

60|$|Once more, {{the beetles}} and flies of Central America must have learned by {{experience}} {{to get out}} of the way of the nimble Central American lizards with great agility, cunning, and alertness. But green lizards are less easy to notice beforehand than brown or red ones; and so the lizards of tropical countries are almost always bright green, with complementary shades of yellow, grey, and purple, just to fit them in with the foliage they lurk among. Everybody who has ever hunted the green tree-toads on the leaves of waterside plants on the Riviera must know how difficult it is to discriminate these brilliant leaf-coloured creatures from the almost identical background on which they rest. Now, just in proportion as the beetles and flies grow still more cautious, even the green lizards themselves fail to pick up a satisfactory livelihood; and so at last <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> most remarkable Nicaraguan form, decked all round with leaf-like expansions, and looking so like the foliage on which it rests that no beetle on earth can possibly detect it.

Duge's name is on it right enough, but if you fellows are really going to shake all day about it, let's have the paper, even if we blow up the house. I'll send for Danes to-night. We'll meet him down town somewhere--two of us, no more--and see what he can suggest. If <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> paper, and Duge's illness isn't a sham, he'll come downstairs to face the biggest smash that any man in New York has ever dreamed of, and serve him d----d well right. I'm sick of the fellow and his ways. For every million we've scooped, he's scooped two. Every deal we've been into, he's had a little the best of us.

6000|$|One other fine feature, {{significant}} of many, let us notice: his {{affection for}} his Mother. When his Mother addressed him as [...] "Your Majesty," [...] he answered, as the Books are careful to tell us: [...] "Call me Son; {{that is the}} Title of all others most agreeable to me!" [...] Words which, {{there can be no}} doubt, came from the heart. Fain would he shoot forth to greatness in filial piety, as otherwise; fain solace himself in doing something kind to his Mother. Generously, lovingly; though again with clear view of the limits. He decrees for her a Title higher than had been customary, as well as more accordant with his feelings; not [...] "Queen Dowager," [...] but [...] "Her Majesty the Queen Mother." [...] He decides to build her a new Palace; [...] "under the Lindens" [...] it is to be, and of due magnificence: in a month or two, he had even got bits of the foundation dug, and the Houses to be pulled down bought or bargained for; [Rodenbeck, p. 15 (30th June-23d Aug. 1740); and correct Stenzel (iv. 44).]--which enterprise, however, was renounced, no doubt with consent, as the public aspects darkened. Nothing in the way of honor, in the way of real affection heartily felt and demonstrated, was wanting to Queen Sophie in her widowhood. But, on the other hand, of public influence no vestige was allowed, if any was ever claimed; and the good kind Mother lived in her Monbijou, the centre and summit of Berlin society; and restricted herself wisely to private matters. She has her domesticities, family affections, readings, speculations; gives evening parties at Monbijou. One glimpse of her in 1742 <b>we</b> <b>get,</b> <b>that</b> of a perfectly private royal Lady; which though it has little meaning, yet as it is authentic, coming from Busching's hand, may serve as one little twinkle in that total darkness, and shall be left to the reader and his fancy:-- ...|$|E
