5000|$|In 1999, Italian {{stone cutting}} equipment, {{originally}} {{designed for use}} in Tuscany's marble quarries was imported by Albion Stone and applied to the extraction of Portland stone. This new technology eliminated the need for blasting, significantly improved the quarries' environmental performance and removed the potential for any possible damage to the stone being quarried through shock. Full account of the local jointing pattern is made when deciding the position and orientation of cuts. Once the quarry faces have been cut, the stone is gently displaced hydraulically. This is done using [...] "hydro-bags", which are thin, flat, steel bags or envelopes that when inflated with water under moderate pressure, are capable of producing the forces necessary to loosen the stone {{to the point where}} it can be easily removed using large <b>wheeled</b> <b>loaders.</b> Splitting stone, using pneumatic drills is arduous work and so wire-saws have been introduced into the quarries, replacing much of the plug and feather cutting.|$|E

40|$|Information about <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> usage {{can be used}} {{in several}} ways to {{optimize}} customer adaption. First, optimizing the configuration and component sizing of a <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> to customer needs can lead to a significant improvement in e. g. fuel efficiency and cost. Second, relevant driving cycles {{to be used in the}} development of <b>wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> can be extracted from usage data.

The main objective here is to develop an on-line algorithm that automatically, using production sensors only, can extract information about the usage of a machine. Two main challenges are that sensors are not located with respect to this task and that significant usage disturbances typically occur during operation. The proposed method is based on a combination of several individually simple techniques using signal processing, state automaton techniques, and parameter estimation algorithms.

40|$|The {{off-highway}} {{construction machinery}} market and its consumers have attracted minimal previous research. This study addresses that void by analyzing annual United Kingdom (UK) (volume/portfolio) new-sales {{data for the}} 10 most popular products within that market, 1990 – 2010 inclusive. Graphical, descriptive statistical, Pearson-correlational, autocorrelational, and elementary modeling are employed to identify contrasts in sales regarding (1) high- and low-volume items; (2) growth trends and significant recessionary effects on volumes; (3) a demand change point circa 1997, since when annual product portfolio has changed little; and (4) product associations in consumer demand. Significant association is demonstrated between demand and construction output, especially with the value of new housing. Subsequently, consumption of <b>wheeled</b> <b>loaders</b> is modeled using construction volume, and demand for mini and crawler excavators is modeled using new-housing data.

40|$|Motivation: Today’s {{sustainability}} {{challenges are}} increasingly being addressed by Product Service Systems to satisfy customers needs while lowering their overall environment impact. These systems are increasingly complex containing diverse artifacts and interactions. To provide a holistic solution centered on the human experience element, design of product-service systems are best driven by data gathered from design thinking methods.     Problem: When considering innovation challenges, such as the deployment of autonomous electric machines on future construction sites, data driven design can suffer {{from a lack of}} available tangible user feedback upon which to make design decisions.   Approach: In the case of this study, the development of a scaled down construction site structured around generally applicable operations was built as a prototype for involving various users in early phase development of a HMI for interacting with prototype machines built by Volvo CE called the HX 01. Qualitative data acquisition methods were derived from Design Thinking approaches to needfinding including: a questionnaire, unstructured interviews and observations.   Results: The prototype scale site became a 5 meter x 5 meter semi-portable site with 1 : 11 scale ratio machines including: excavators, <b>wheeled</b> <b>loaders</b> and autonomous haulers. The product tested with the site was an augmented reality interface to provide a communication platform between workers and the autonomous haulers designed at building trust to enable collaboration. Test users and observers provided feedback confirming the effectiveness of the scale site scenario to convey the necessary context of a realistic interaction experience. Beyond HMI testing, the site served as a tangible artifact to instigate conversations across domain boundaries.   Conclusions: The tangible experiential scenario platform developed displayed the capability to go beyond one-way concept communication of concepts to customers, by including customers as integral participants in the testing of new products/services. For design teams, the site can facilitate deeper learnings and validation via a shared contextualization of user feedback. The further implications may also include: the ability to increase rationale at design decision gate’s assessment of risk in new products and enable the identification of emergent issues in complex future scenarios...|$|E

40|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> in the V-type {{loading cycle}} are {{characterized}} by complicated loading conditions, nonlinear power-train system, and time-variable engine power distribution. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} predict the fuel consumption of <b>wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> in the V-type loading cycle. The static matching methods cannot provide fuel consumption prediction for the loading cycle. In this paper, the prediction method and model of the fuel consumption for <b>wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> in the V-type loading cycle were proposed. Firstly, the hydraulic system data were tested when a <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> loaded three different materials in a typical V-type loading cycle. Secondly, the tested data were filtered by the 8 th-order Butterworth filter and the dimensionless power deduction equations of hydraulic power system for loading three different materials were obtained by Gaussian and linear fitting based on the filtered data in the loading cycle. Finally, fuel consumption was obtained with the compiling dynamic calculation program as well as input parameters of tested vehicle speed, throttle parameter, and the dimensionless equation. The simulation results agreed well with experiment results.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> {{are prone}} to lateral tilting {{accidents}} due to their complex working environment, variable structure frame and the large offset of the centroid position.
