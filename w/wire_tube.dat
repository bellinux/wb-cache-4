In 1641 he built an observatory on {{the roofs of}} his three connected houses, equipping it with splendid instruments, ultimately including a large Keplerian telescope of 150 ft focal length, [...] with a wood and <b>wire</b> <b>tube</b> he constructed himself. This {{may have been the}} longest [...] "tubed" [...] telescope before the advent of the tubeless aerial telescope.The observatory was known by the name Sternenburg (Stellaeburgum; Gwiezdny Zamek) or [...] "Star Castle"This private observatory was visited by Polish Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga on 29 January 1660.As a subject of the Polish kings, Hevelius enjoyed the patronage of four consecutive kings of Poland, and his family was raised to the position of nobility by the King of Poland Jan Kazimierz in 1660, who previously visited his observatory in 1659. While the noble status was not ratified by the Polish Sejm Hevelius's coat of arms includes the distinctive Polish royal crown.The Polish King John III Sobieski who regularly visited Hevelius numerous times in years 1677-1683 released him from paying taxes connected to brewing and allowed his beer to be sold freely outside the city limits. In May 1679 the young Englishman Edmond Halley visited him as emissary of the Royal Society, whose fellow Hevelius had been since 1664. The Royal Society considers him one of the first German fellows. Małgorzata Czerniakowska (2005) writes that [...] "Jan Heweliusz was the first Pole to be inducted into the Royal Society in London. This important event took place on 19th March 1664". Hevelius considered himself as being citizen of the Polish world (civis Orbis Poloniae) and stated in a letter dated from 9 January 1681 that he was Civis orbis Poloni, qui in honorem patriae suae rei Literariae bono tot labores molestiasque, absit gloria, cum maximo facultatum suarum dispendio perduravit-"citizen of Polish world who, for glory of his country and for the good of science, worked so much, and while not boasting much, executed his work with most effort per his abilities"Halley had been instructed by Robert Hooke and John Flamsteed to persuade Hevelius to use telescopes for his measurements, yet Hevelius demonstrated that he could do well with only quadrant and alidade. He is thus considered the last astronomer to do major work without the use of a telescope.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} if {{the use of a}} transpalatal (TPA) or Nance palatal arch with varying degrees of molar rotations significantly affects resistance to sliding during sliding mechanics. Also, to establish if there is reduced resistance to sliding using the extraoral tube (EOT) on molar bands opposed to the straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube</b> when using a TPA or Nance- palatal arch with rotated molars Materials and method: A custom made experimental apparatus approximating the transpalatal arch, allowing for 1 -degree incremental changes to molar rotation was designed. A 0. 019 x 0. 025 ” stainless steel archwire was displaced through the molar tubes to determine the effect of molar rotation on resistance to sliding, determined as work. Unilateral and bilateral palatal rotations were evaluated as well as comparison of the extraoral and straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube.</b> Results: The work required to achieve a constant archwire displacement was significantly increased for bilaterally, palatally rotated molars compared with a unilateral rotation (p< 0. 05 for displacement of both 0. 5 and 0. 1 mm). Pearson correlation analysis identified a significant association between extent of molar rotation and difference in work between unilateral and bilateral rotated molars (p-value 0. 002 and 0. 01 for displacement of 0. 5 and 0. 1 mm respectively). Placement of the archwire in the extraoral tube significantly reduced the work required for a fixed displacement compared with the straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube.</b> The magnitude of the effect was greatest for bilateral palatal rotated molars and was highly significant (p < 0. 001 for 0. 5 mm). Conclusion: The relationship between work and molar rotation was found to be non-linear, with an exponential increase in work with increasing palatal rotations. Bilaterally, palatally rotated molars resulted in a significantly increased amount of work for all amounts of displacement of the archwire compared with a unilateral rotation. Use of the EOT significantly reduced the work required to displace the archwire compared with the straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E

30|$|Another {{factor that}} should be {{considered}} is the morphology of TiO 2 -based photoanode materials. There have been several studies on how the morphology affects the conversional efficiency of solar cell [12 - 15]. A mesoporous structure TiO 2 nanoparticle film has a higher surface area. This increases the amount of semiconducting quantum dots that can be loaded [12]. However, the increase in the amount of surface defects and grain boundaries in the film would greatly retard the electron transport needed for the electron recombination process. To solve this problem, arrays of one-dimensional (1 D) nanostructure (rod, <b>wire</b> <b>tube)</b> can be formed. It is generally believed however that a 1 D structure (through a combination of a reduced recombination (achieving high electron-transfer rate) process and lower surface area) would have reduced solar-to-electrical conversion efficiencies [13].|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Laparoscopic {{adjustable}} gastric banding is {{the most}} frequently performed bariatric procedure {{for the treatment of}} morbid obesity and is associated with low morbidity and mortality. Complications related to obesity surgery are rare and their presentation is often non-specific. Thus, it is highly important for physicians who are practising bariatric surgery to be aware of complications described in single-case studies or series when they come across similar complications even years after the primary bariatric operation. Case presentation We report the case of a 47 -year-old Malay woman who was admitted with symptoms and signs suggesting intestinal obstruction five years after gastric band placement. Conclusions In our patient, the band connection <b>wire</b> <b>tube</b> was the cause of both small bowel obstruction and colonic erosion. Computed axial tomography is the cornerstone of the investigation of such patients. After surgical removal of the connecting tube, our patient recovered without sequelae. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent {{investigations of}} the influence of hydrogen on superelastic Nitinol (NiTi) and its effect on fatigue properties. NiTi is used in applications such as arterial stents, vena cava filters, and endodontic files where fatigue performance is a critical design component. ASTM Standard F- 2063 - 00 limits hydrogen concentration to 50 wppm for wrought NiTi products (bar, <b>wire,</b> <b>tube)</b> used in the manufacture of medical devices and other surgical instruments. To date, however, no studies have linked this hydrogen standard to fatigue performance. The data presented here suggest hydrogen concentrations as low as 50 wppm cause a small yet statistically significant decrease in fatigue life above 1. 4 % strain. Increasing hydrogen concentration does not appear to affect fatigue life at or below 1. 4 % strain up to 80 wppm hydrogen. The data presented here also show a second low cycle fatigue regime previously not analyzed with Coffin-Manson approximations for transforming NiTi...|$|E

40|$|The major {{degradation}} mechanism occur due to oxidation and hot corrosion {{which is responsible}} for failure of boiler and gas turbine components. These failures occur because of the usage of wide range of fuels such as coal, oil at increased temperatures. In current investigation oxidation and hot corrosion performances of bare Boiler Steel SA- 192 has been evaluated in air and with aggressive environment. For aggressive environment composition of sodium sulphate and vanadium pentaoxide have been mixed in proper ratio (Na 2 SO 4 + 60 %V 2 O 5) to provide an experimental condition under cyclic conditions at an elevated temperatures of 850 0 C & 950 0 C. The kinetics of the corrosion is approximated by weight change measurements made after each cycle for total duration of 50 cycles. Each cycle consists of keeping the samples for 1 hour duration in Kanthol <b>wire</b> <b>tube</b> furnace at 850 0 C and 950 0 C followed by 20 minute cooling in ambient air. Weight change data has been taken after each cycle by digital electronic balance machine with an accuracy of 1 milligram.

Boiler Steel SA- 192 has shown poor performance in oxidising and in hot corrosion environment as the temperature increased.

40|$|Many {{models have}} been {{developed}} for simulation of shape memory alloy (SMA) constitutive responses. The historical development of these models has shifted as fundamental understanding of the physics of SMAs has been advanced: from a focus on transformation behaviors in isolation to the study of cyclic deformations and fatigue, i. e., coupled transformation and plasticity. The motivation for the model we present in this study was to arrive at a single, unified model capable of simulating rate-independent, thermo-mechanical shape memory behaviors, and their coupling to plastic deformation with high computational efficiency. In formulating an energy landscape at a macroscopic scale that encompasses elastic, initiation, and saturation of phase transformation, martensite reorientation, plasticity, and the coupling of plasticity with phase transformation and martensite reorientation terms, and then deriving an implicit, variational discretization of the equations, we achieved this goal. Furthermore, the use of invariant-based transformation surfaces allows us to simulate processing textures that range from random (i. e., as-cast ingot) to transversely anisotropic (i. e., rod, <b>wire,</b> <b>tube)</b> with no additional computational expense. In this presentation, we will review the model framework. Calibration and verification of the model will be illustrated through simulation of empirical data sets that include proportional and nonproportional axial-torsion loading and cyclic tensile deformation to moderate (³ 10 %) strains. Furthermore, we will verify the evolution of the martensite volume fraction simulated by the model with in-situ diffraction experimental data...|$|E
