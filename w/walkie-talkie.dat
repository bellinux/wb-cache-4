5|$|Resolving {{that they}} will never again let their guard down, the group decides {{that they will}} try to reach Fort Benning, the {{alternative}} to the CDC proposed by Shane in the prior season. As in {{the final version of the}} episode, a narration scene with Rick speaking to Morgan on the <b>walkie-talkie</b> was included, but was re-shot with modified dialog that served to replace the above material, allowing the premiere to begin with the group putting Atlanta behind them. Rick sports his full sheriff's wardrobe in the reshoot, whereas in the original version he is wearing the white undershirt he was wearing in the Season 1 finale.|$|E
5|$|The story {{follows a}} Shoshone National Forest fire lookout named Henry in 1989, {{following}} the Yellowstone fires of 1988. A month {{after his first}} day at work, strange things begin happening to both him and his supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a <b>walkie-talkie,</b> with the player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform {{the process by which}} their relationship is developed. The game was directed by Olly Moss and Sean Vanaman, written by Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Moss and Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist Jane Ng. The game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by Moss. The design draws inspiration from New Deal advertisements by the National Park Service and field research conducted in Yosemite National Park.|$|E
5|$|The <b>walkie-talkie</b> {{interaction}} in Firewatch {{is inspired by}} the relationship in BioShock between the player character and Atlas, {{as well as the}} dialog system from The Walking Dead. At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip syncing and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in The Walking Dead, as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.|$|E

As these <b>walkie-talkies</b> are low-powered devices {{which do not}} potentially cause interference to other licensed radio services, it need not be licensed for use in Singapore. However, the device must be type approved by IDA for local sale.|$|R

25|$|The group {{decides to}} {{fight their way}} to the local marina, and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They begin {{reinforcing}} two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape. However, they also need to pick up Andy, who is starving. They strap food and a <b>walkie-talkie</b> onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips gets into Andy's store safely but a zombie follows through the dog door, ultimately biting Andy. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers and kill Andy, rescuing Nicole. They grab ammunition {{and go back to the}} mall. Along the way, Tucker breaks his legs and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation.|$|E

25|$|Police boxes {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role in police work until the late 1960s to early 1970s, when they were phased out following the introduction of personal radios. As the main functions of the boxes were superseded by the rise of portable telecommunications devices like the <b>walkie-talkie</b> and the near universal access by the public to telephones and the 999 emergency number, very few police boxes remain in Britain today. Some have been converted into High Street coffee bars. These are common in Edinburgh, though the city also has dozens that remain untouched — most in various states of disrepair. Edinburgh's boxes are relatively large, and are of a rectangular plan, with a design by Ebenezer James MacRae, who was inspired by the city's abundance of neoclassical architecture. At their peak there were 86 scattered around the city. In 2012, Lothian and Borders Police sold a further 22, leaving them owning 20.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{reaches the}} hotel where Clementine is captive where he comes {{face to face with}} her captor, who reveals that he was the owner of the station wagon that the group ransacked after leaving the dairy and lost his family to walkers as a result. Seeking revenge, the {{stranger}} found Clementine on his <b>walkie-talkie</b> and manipulated her into keeping tabs on the group under the guise that he had her parents and had been following them ever since. Realizing that the man is insane, Lee, with Clementine's help, kills him. As Lee and Clementine leave the hotel, Clementine spots her parents, both of whom have turned into walkers, and Lee falls unconscious. Awakening soon after, he realizes he is near conversion, and instructs her to escape the city and meet Omid and Christa at the edge of town. The player can choose to have Lee order Clementine to either kill him or leave him to become a walker, or can opt to do nothing, in which case Clementine will choose based on the culmination of the player's choices within the game.|$|E
25|$|Pacheco {{repeatedly}} {{went into}} the lab at night to take photographs and to escort scientists, including veterinarians and a primatologist, through it to secure their testimony. Newkirk lay crouched {{on the back seat}} of a car outside, hidden under a large cardboard box with holes for her eyes, using a <b>walkie-talkie</b> from a toy store to alert Pacheco if anyone else entered the building. The monkeys' living conditions documented by Pacheco were graphically disturbing. Having collected the evidence, Newkirk and Pacheco alerted the police, who raided the lab, removed the monkeys, and charged Taub with 113 counts of cruelty to animals and six counts of failing to provide adequate veterinary care. Taub maintained that he had been set up by Newkirk and Pacheco while he was on vacation and that several of the photographs had been staged. The judge found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care and fined him $3,000. A later jury trial saw five of these counts dismissed, and the sixth was overturned on appeal because of a technicality. The National Institutes of Health, which had funded Taub's research, was among the scientists and other professionals who criticized the conditions in which Taub had kept the monkeys, though the NIH later reversed its decision when the charges against Taub were overturned.|$|E

Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the <b>walkie-talkie</b> they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie dust from Pan, hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg had no idea that they were working for Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet in a clearing, with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that nothing has changed, and scoffs at the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|E

500|$|Dunlop {{found that}} the large scale of the game necessitated small enemies, which were partly {{inspired}} by the characters of Lemmings. The game's control scheme consisted of a mouse controlling the guns and a keyboard or joystick controlling the mech's movements. Dunlop explained that this allowed the player to maintain freedom of the weapons while simultaneously moving the mech and felt that it [...] "gave the gameplay a bit more depth and interest". In regards to the game's side-scrolling, the team took inspiration from their 1988 game Menace. When played on advanced Amiga models, Walker included a speech between the mech and its headquarters that had been recorded by Dunlop and Glancy over <b>walkie-talkie.</b>|$|E
