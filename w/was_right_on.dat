25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E
500|$|The role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was {{originally}} written for Bill Murray, {{and there was}} also studio pressure for Robin Williams. The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: [...] "When we met with Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. But when we met with him and talked to him about the character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> the same page with us". Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood. Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.|$|E

500|$|The Dimitri {{character}} took {{a darker}} turn in 1997, in what Soap Opera Digest considered {{an effort to}} make Erica more sympathetic after her role in the kidnapping of the baby Maddie Grey (then known as Sonya). Soap Opera Digest praised the move in an article naming Nader Performer of the Week, saying, [...] "Nader has been surprisingly effective as a meanie, and nothing short of brilliant taking an already complex character and making him more compelling." [...] Soap Opera Weekly's Gabrielle Winkel expressed similar sentiments, saying, [...] "Michael Nader is far more entertaining and compelling now that Dimitri is out for himself than when he was as Erica's devoted husband...AMC <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> target when it developed Dimitri's dark side. Nader's brooding looks and raspy voice have always given Dimitri that evil edge. Nader, though, wisely keeps Dimitri's obsessiveness sufficiently in check to make it believable." [...] At the conclusion of the storyline Soap Opera Digest again named him Performer of the Week for [...] "unleashing the sort of go-for-broke fury and fray that actors are usually reluctant to release unless they're certain their character is about to be killed off." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!". When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that [...] "in many respects Kneale <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> the money [...] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train-wreck on live TV".|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 1910, Williams {{played for}} Cardiff against Bristol, while Maddocks {{played on the}} wing for Wales against France. For the match against England on 15 January, Williams was called up as a reserve. However, in a game for Cardiff against Moseley, he picked up an injury to his thigh that would necessitate a few weeks out. After the England game, which Wales lost, it was rumoured that Williams would be {{recalled}} to the wing for the match against Scotland, but his injury persisted. The Welsh defeated Scotland, and {{it was expected that}} they would field unchanged team for the final game of the tournament, against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 12 March. Melville Baker, however, was injured playing on the left wing and opened up a place for Williams to be selected. Once again the Welsh backline was filled with Cardiff men: Bush, Spiller, Dyke, Gibbs, who took on the captain's duties, and Williams. Joe Pugsley, another Cardiff man, was in the Welsh pack. Ireland were leading by a try until just before half time, when Williams scored a try to bring Wales level. In the second half, he scored two more; Gibbs and Dyke each scored one, while Bush kicked a dropgoal, to win the game 3–19. [...] "Forward" [...] writing in the Evening Express said: [...] "Williams <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> top of his form, and his cleverness in beating three or four Irishmen, including the fullback, before he scored his three tries was really splendid." ...|$|E

2500|$|The scene {{changes to}} Istanbul and Johannes Lepsius’s meeting {{with members of}} a dervish order called the [...] "Thieves of the Art." [...] It was {{important}} to Werfel {{to show that the}} Young Turks and the Three Pashas, did not represent Turkish society. It was also important to show that Enver <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> certain points in regard to the Western powers, which had exploited Turkey and treated it throughout the nineteenth century as a virtual colony. Most of the first chapter of Book Three is written as a dramatic dialogue, during which Lepsius witnesses the Sufi whirling devotions and learns first-hand about the deep resentment against the West—- especially Western [...] "progress" [...] as instituted by the Young Turks—- and the atrocities in concentration camps set up in the Mesopotamian desert for deported Armenians. He also encounters Bagradian's friend, Agha Rifaat Bereket. The latter agrees to bring supplies to Musa Dagh, purchased with funds collected by Lepsius in Germany. The episode ends with Lepsius witnessing Enver and Talaat being driven past in a limousine. When the car suffers two loud tire punctures, Lepsius at first thinks they have been assassinated (which foreshadows the real deaths of Talaat and Djemal Pasha by Armenian assassins).|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Jones won the National League MVP award after {{becoming}} the first player ever to hit over [...]300 (.319) while slugging 40 or more home runs (45; 3rd in the NL) and doubles (41), drawing 100 or more walks (126; 3rd in the league), notching 100 or more RBI (110) and runs scored (116), and stealing 20 or more bases (25). [...] Ironically, Jones was not selected for the MLB All-Star game that year. He was also walked intentionally 18 times; 2nd in the league, and his [...]633 slugging percentage was 4th best in the NL. A major factor in his selection as MVP was his performance against the Braves' chief competitors, the New York Mets. The Braves led the National League East by only one game as they entered a three-game September series against the Mets, the team that <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> their heels. Atlanta swept the series at Turner Field, though, largely thanks to Jones, who hit four home runs and drove in seven of the thirteen runs that the Braves scored. For the season, he hit [...]319 with a [...]510 on-base percentage, a 1.000 slugging percentage, and seven home runs against the Mets. During the 1999 NLCS, Jones drew the ire of Mets fans by saying, [...] "Now, all the Mets fans can go home and put their Yankees' stuff on." [...] In the playoffs, Jones led the Braves to the World Series against the New York Yankees, in which the Braves were swept. He did, however, hit their only {{home run in the}} series, against Yankees' starter Orlando Hernández.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 May 2011, Khan {{agreed to}} fight 33 year old two-weight {{champion}} Zab Judah (41-6, 28 KOs) {{in attempt to}} unify the IBF and WBA light welterweight titles in Las Vegas on 23 July. Judah had reclaimed the IBF title two months earlier against Kaizer Mabuza. Khan was unhappy that a fight with Bradley could not be made. He said, [...] "Bradley was the guy I wanted to fight but he chickened out. I offered him 50% of UK revenue, which is unheard of, and 50% of all revenue in America, that's how much I wanted to fight him, but he didn't want it." [...] The fight was broadcast on Primetime in UK and HBO in USA. Khan started the fight with a left jab. Round 1 saw a busy Amir Khan as he fought from the outside and kept Judah away with jabs and straights. All four rounds were taken by Khan. Ultimately on the fifth round Zab was taken down with a right uppercut to the body, in which at first commentators believed it was a low blow, since Judah was showing signs of agonising pain, {{but when it was}} seen from a different camera angle, it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> the belt, leading to an 18th knockout for Khan in his career so far. Khan later rejected claims for the low blow saying, [...] "He went down. It was above the belt. Zab's a great fighter. I respect him a lot. But it was nowhere near below [...] It was a great shot." [...] Over 5 rounds, Khan landed 61 of 284 total punches (21%) and Judah landed 20 of 115 (17%). For the fight, Khan earned $1,072,500 and Judah had a $500,000 purse. The fight averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.|$|E
