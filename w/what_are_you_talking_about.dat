500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{unconfirmed}} stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once {{offered him a}} seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, [...] "Ten years? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Rickey got 16, 17 years." [...] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player. While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson {{was said to have}} commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, [...] "That was me." [...] The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, {{as well as with the}} 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> It was so dumb." ...|$|E
