5|$|George Elsworth Smith {{was born}} in Sewickley, Pennsylvania in 1862 to Elizabeth ("Eliza") and Christian Smith. The Smith family also {{included}} two sisters, Annie and Elizabeth, and another son, William C. Smith, that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> younger than George Smith. His mother was originally from Ireland and emigrated to the United States in 1857, and {{his father was a}} carpenter from Baden, Germany. Eliza remarried after Christian Smith's death in the early 1870s to retail grocer Edward Downing, who died in the 1880s. She remarried a second time on November 20, 1906 to real estate and coal developer Thomas S. Wood after George Smith's death.|$|E

He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E

25|$|In June 218, Macrinus was {{defeated}} by the forces supporting Elagabalus outside Antioch, while Artabanus faced the uprising of the Persian Sassanid clan under Ardashir I. Nisibis was thus the last major battle between Rome and Parthia, as the Parthian dynasty <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later overthrown by Ardashir. However, warfare between Rome and Persia soon resumed, as Ardashir and Macrinus' successor Alexander Severus fought over Mesopotamia, and hostilities continued intermittently until the Muslim conquests.|$|E
25|$|Prior to World War I, Caruso {{had been}} romantically {{linked to an}} Italian soprano, Ada Giachetti, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> older than he was. Though already married, Giachetti bore Caruso four sons during their liaison, which lasted from 1897 to 1908. Two survived infancy: Rodolfo Caruso (1898-1951) and singer/actor Enrico Caruso, Jr. (1904-1987). Ada had left her husband, {{manufacturer}} Gino Botti, and an existing son to cohabit with the tenor. Information provided in Scott's biography of Caruso suggests that she was his vocal coach {{as well as his}} lover. Statements by Enrico Caruso, Jr. in his book tend to substantiate this. Her relationship with Caruso broke down after 11 years and they separated. Giachetti's subsequent attempts to sue him for damages were dismissed by the courts.|$|E

Workers at the Bendix Corporation actually staged the first sit-in strike in American history in 1936. [...] Fast development {{led to the creation}} of electric rail transportation throughout the area and, in 1925, the South Shore interurban streetcar service was established from downtown South Bend to downtown Chicago. South Bend was the first community in the United States to have an electrified trolley system (even though it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> before it was usable and profitable).|$|E
500|$|Series creator Damian Kindler {{conceived}} the pilot in 2001. When {{he became a}} Stargate SG-1 writer, he later asked Martin Wood, a director from the same show, if there was potential for a series, which Wood believed there <b>was.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later, Kindler asked Amanda Tapping {{to take part in}} the project, and she accepted. Sanctuary originally started as an eight-part bi-weekly web series in 2007, produced by Vancouver-based Stage 3 Media. The producers of the series were looking to expand the series on other mediums, including television. Due to the success of the web series, in January2008, the Sci Fi Channel announced the commissioning of a first season of 13 episodes. The move to television has allowed the producers to widen the scope for the season. According to actress and executive producer Amanda Tapping, the season [...] "is very different from what you've seen on the Web". However, her character, Helen Magnus, would still be a [...] "crazy character; [...] very eccentric and very sexy and very unapologetic". The season was given an estimated budget of $21million.|$|E
500|$|The Digital Fixs Ryan Poxon gave CRUSH3D a {{score of}} seven out of ten and called it a [...] "puzzle game that {{genuinely}} surprised me at how brain teasing the game actually is." [...] 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it {{a score of}} 6.6 out of 10 and said, [...] "For a puzzle game, Crush 3D {{is a good choice}} for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> ago, it’s still a decent game to check out. If you never saw the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." [...] However, Digital Spys Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: [...] "Despite the five-year gap between releases, Crush 3D takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very {{little in the way of}} brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, Crush 3D gets it right where it counts." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.|$|E

500|$|The {{volunteer}} {{military force}} was revived in 1859, with new and modern arms for the infantry, cavalry and artillery. Though there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of enthusiasm and a restructuring in 1866, by 1870 the force was virtually disbanded. In that year also, British troops were {{withdrawn from the}} other Australian colonies; none were by then stationed in South Australia. With no definitive defence policy, in 1864 the government had sought advice from Captain Parkin of HMS Falcon and Commodore Sir William Wiseman commander of the Australian station; both visiting British naval officers. They both recommended fixed fortifications for the coast supported by gunboats. Sir Wiseman's report particularly recommended construction of forts at Semaphore, Port Creek's entrance and one midway between. In 1864 a story circulated, supported by press speculation, {{that there was a}} danger of the Russian fleet attacking Melbourne should Russia and Britain find themselves at war. The South Australian Register produced an editorial decrying the states lack of defences. Within days £20,000 (A$4.14million in 2005)Converted to Australian Dollars at $1=£0.4112 from Australian Reserve Bank published spot rate for January 2005 was provided by the government for defence, an amount then seen as insufficient for significant preparation. The danger passed without any lasting defence action except the government's in-principle adoption of Sir Wiseman's recommendations. To curtail costs only the Semaphore fort was to be built initially, as it was considered the most critical. Site preparation begun and two [...] guns were purchased, but escalating cost estimates caused the plan to be abandoned by 1868.|$|E
2500|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> {{before an}} {{official}} programme for the Fringe was created. John Menzies {{compiled a list}} of shows under the title [...] "Other Events" [...] in their omnibus festival brochure, but it was printer C.J. Cousland who was the first to publish a listings guide, in 1954. [...] This was funded by participating companies and was entitled [...] "Additional Entertainments", since the name [...] "Fringe" [...] was still not yet in regular usage. It also used a strange cover motif.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, {{a lack of}} inter-cultural {{experience}} on both sides combined with the traditional Byzantine Soviet bureaucracy and way of business {{proved to be the}} dooming factors for the game. Just to form the [...] "final" [...] game contract, Raycom officials met with six different sets of Soviet negotiating teams, signing at last on April 27 in Moscow [...] nine months after the game was first announced. Executives at Raycom felt in the end that the game <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> premature given the changes occurring in the Soviet Union at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of {{the pilot}} episode were {{generally}} favorable, scoring 67 out of 100 on Metacritic, and invoking many comparisons to Lost and 24, each of which had ended its run the preceding spring. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "as big, brash and promising as Heroes <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> back". Varietys Brian Lowry called it [...] "an enticing start". Linda Stasi of the New York Post stated that [...] "if 24, Lost, and The 4400 had a baby, it would be The Event".|$|E
2500|$|We cannot {{precisely}} {{ascertain the}} time when tithes were first introduced into this country. [...] Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, {{about the end of}} the fifth century. [...] But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, The Movie Channel {{became one}} of the first {{television}} channels to broadcast movies in stereophonic audio; from that point until 1988, films presented in stereo were verbally and visually denoted in prime time lineup bumpers shown during promotional breaks within its daytime schedule – with titles for films available in stereo accompanied by the now-standard headphone symbol – and, until 1985, in a custom version of its feature presentation bumper (thereafter, films transmitted in the format were denoted along with the film rating during the latter bumper). As the standard for television broadcasts in stereo <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> away, cable operators had to simulcast the multichannel audio feed as an FM radio signal. Interstitial segments that aired during breaks between films for much of the 1980s included Behind the Scenes (featuring biographies and interviews with actors appearing in films set to air on the network or being released theatrically), The Heart of Hollywood (borrowing its name from the slogan that TMC used concurrently during the segment's run from September 1985 to May 1988, and featuring more in-depth interviews with film stars), Reel Shorts (a showcase of live action and animated short films, which continued to air during extended breaks until 1991, by then under the [...] "Film Shorts" [...] moniker) and Reel Hits (featuring music videos for songs featured in films of that period and their accompanying soundtracks).|$|E
