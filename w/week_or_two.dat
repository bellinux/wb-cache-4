5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E

We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done.

And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the Minor Counties {{played a}} minimum of eight matches, until recent times of two days duration, and few of them played more than 12 matches. Usually the matches were fairly local, against {{neighbouring}} counties, rather than against distant teams, and matches were often played in batches so that amateur players could time their holidays from work {{to take part in}} several games over a period of a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> When they competed, the first-class county second elevens often played many more games.|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation.

50|$|In some countries, school summer {{vacation}} is only six <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> months supposedly so students don't forget {{large amounts of}} information learned {{in the past year}} (See: Summer learning loss).Other education reformers believed that children were overstimulated in a system which required 48 weeks of schooling. They believe that over-schooling could lead to nervous disorders, depression, insanity, and separation anxiety towards families. They believe that children need the 2-3 months off to relax and also to take a break from other childhood stresses associated with school such as peer pressure, cliques, bullying, and the pressure of heavy loads of homework.|$|R
