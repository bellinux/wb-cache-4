40|$|Abstract. fuzzy {{factors in}} the <b>worm</b> <b>reducer</b> design are analyzed, and a multi-objective {{optimization}} model with minimum volume and maximum bearing capacity is established in this paper. Optimal level cut-set method is introduced to conduct comprehensive evaluation on constraining fuzziness and convert the fuzzy constraint into general constraint according to the actual conditions and requirements; for multi-objectives, single-objective optimal solutions are fuzzified to form fuzzy sets to establish the membership functions of the fuzzy sets by taking the fuzziness between the single objectives and between the single objectives and multiple objectives into consideration, and multi-objective optimal solutions are obtained by maximizing the membership functions of the fuzzy set intersection. For an actual <b>worm</b> <b>reducer,</b> the fuzzy theory and method are applied to obtain results, and the validness of the method is demonstrated by comparing such results with the conventional design data. Preface Volume, weight and bearing capacity are the important indexes for evaluating the performance of worm gear reducer and these indexes depends on the design and selection of the transmission parameters such as number of threads of worm z 1, diametral quotient q, module m, worm diamete...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{to use a}} curve of {{changing}} vibration amplitude of the rotating moment on the worm shaft of reducer {{in the process of}} growing brake (loading) moment as one of criteria of the <b>worm</b> <b>reducer</b> operability. A condition of reducer operability at the nominal moment is lack of vibrations of the rotating moment with a critical value of amplitude. It is shown that vibrations of rotating moment on a shaft of the electric engine, by their nature, are self-vibrations in the system with "negative friction". Values of the brake moment at which there is a sharp increase of vibration amplitude leading to operability loss correspond to the nominal moment for this reducer or to the brake moment, corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is shown that different lubricants differently influence on the generation of self-vibrations. The most efficient damping occurs when using oil with the additive "Striboil", and the reason of falling efficiency at the excess of the nominal moment is essentially increased energy losses at generation of vibrations with "negative friction", especially when approaching to the resonance area. Thus, taking into account a nature of damping vibrations, with using different lubricants, allows us to increase the permissible tension since the more is a damping value the more is a brake moment corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is noted that, when using the additives to oils, a growth of the permissible tension is caused by the processes of film formation increasing the real contact area, which increases its share of the nominal contact area determined by the Hertz formula. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{antiwear}} {{properties of}} the oils in the steel-bronze contact have been investigated according to the modified methods RD- 50 - 531. The antiwear action synergism of the triethyleneglycol, ethylcarbitol and neonol AF- 9 - 12 mixtures at operation in the steel-bronze friction pair has been revealed. It has been determined that the mixtures of the low-molecular polyglycols possess an ability to iron the bronze friction surface. The composition of the corrosion inhibitors to the polyglycol oils has been selected. The power-saving oil "Neolub" on base of the polyglycol mixtures for lubrication of the <b>worm</b> <b>reducers,</b> which is applied successfully in the lift service of Moscow has been developed. The economic effect caused by an application of the oil "Neolub" constitutes more than 28 mln roubles/t yearly {{at the expense of}} the reducer efficiency increase and electric power consumption decrease.

40|$|Material {{handling}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} and in fact an indispensable job in industries for it is encountered at every stage right from the time raw materials enter the factory gate to the point when it leaves in form of finished products. The engineering of material handling falls under two categories depending on form of material: bulk solid handling and unit handling. In case of handling lumpy materials like coals etc., feeder plays a vital role as an uninterrupted source of uniform feed provider to the conveyor system. Although several feeders like belt, apron, screw, feeders etc are available, reciprocating feeders are still in use because it ensures a continuous and controlled feed rate, is low in cost, its drive mechanism is simple, it can handle wide range of miscellaneous materials including lumps, easy in assembly and disassembly and maintenance requirement is quite low. The challenge which we have taken via the project, is to design a drive mechanism for a reciprocating coal feeder. We call it a challenge because we have to design various intricate components like couplings, <b>worm</b> <b>reducers,</b> gearbox etc. We call it complicated since all the components are interdependent on each other to a great extent. So we cannot design anything randomly. We have to take into considerations the smallest of small things like the various forces acting, how each component can fail under various stress conditions. We have to optimize everything right from the motor selection, to speed reduction ratio selection, to the capacity of coal which we can handle. We are going to follow the above-mentioned strategies so that our project does not remain just a theory but can become a reality for industries...|$|R
