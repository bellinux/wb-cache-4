5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} <b>weight</b> <b>standard,</b> the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, {{and it was also}} used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45g, but one should keep in mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman <b>weight</b> <b>standard</b> is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire was reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|It {{is presumed}} that Poseidonia harbored {{refugees}} from its mother city, Sybaris, when that city was conquered by Croton in 510 BC. In the early fifth century, Poseidonia's coins adopted the Achaean <b>weight</b> <b>standard</b> and the bull seen on Sybarite coins. A. J. Graham thinks it was plausible {{that the number}} of refugees was large enough for some kind of synoecism to have occurred between the Poseidonians and the Sybarites, possibly {{in the form of a}} sympolity.|$|E

25|$|The penny {{initially}} weighed 20 to 22.5 modern grains (1.3 to 1.5 g). It was standardized to 32 Tower grains, 1/240th of a Tower pound (approx. 350 g). The alloy {{was set to}} {{sterling silver}} of 925/1000 in 1158 under King Henry II. The <b>weight</b> <b>standard</b> was changed to the Troy pound (373.242 g) in 1527 under Henry VIII, i.e. a pennyweight became about 1.555 grams. As the purity and weight of the coin was critical, {{the name of the}} moneyer who manufactured the coin, and at which mint, often appeared on the reverse side of the coin.|$|E
25|$|The first Indian coins {{were either}} round, square or long sticks of silver with punch marks issued under various kingdoms {{starting}} from around 600 BCE onwards. Issuers included Kashi, Kosala, the Magadha Empire, Kuru, Panchala, Taxila, Gandhara, Kamboja, Avanti in the Narbada Valley, Saurashtra Peninsula, and the Eastern Deccan. The first coins issued by a unified Indian empire {{was from the}} Maurya Empire, though they were similar to the older issues. During the 4th century BC, after Alexander the Great's conquest of the Indus Valley and Punjab region, the Greek currency Drachma was introduced and was carried on by Bactria, Indo-Scythians and Kushans. All these were of the Attica <b>weight</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Its {{early history}} {{reveals that the}} {{maritime}} importance of the island dates back to pre-Dorian times. It is usually stated on the authority of Ephorus, that Pheidon of Argos established a mint in Aegina, the first city-state to issue coins in Europe, the Aeginetic stater. One stamped stater (having the mark of some authority {{in the form of}} a picture or words) can be seen in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris. It is an electrum stater of a turtle, an animal sacred to Aphrodite, struck at Aegina that dates from 700 BC. Therefore, it is thought that the Aeginetes, within 30 or 40years of the invention of coinage in Asia Minor by the Ionian Greeks or the Lydians (c. 630 BC), might have been the ones to introduce coinage to the Western world. The fact that the Aeginetic standard of weights and measures (developed during the mid-7th century) was one of the two standards in general use in the Greek world (the other being the Euboic-Attic) is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island. The Aeginetic <b>weight</b> <b>standard</b> of about 12.3 grams was widely adopted in the Greek world during the 7th century BC. The Aeginetic stater was divided into three drachmae of 4.1 grams of silver. Staters depicting a sea-turtle were struck up to the end of the 5th century BC. Following the end of the Peloponnesian War, 404 BC, it was replaced by the land tortoise.|$|E
40|$|If {{we accept}} the thesis that {{advanced}} metrological systems existed in Bronze Age societies, described and analysed as <b>weight</b> <b>standards</b> by many authors, we should also consider its simple consequence; these <b>weight</b> <b>standards</b> were the successors of earlier and rather simpler systems of value that developed within Eneolithic societies. Dealing {{with the issue of}} early metallurgy in Europe, some authors have traced patterns and proliferation cycles of copper for this period that allow us to see that the introduction of metal to the main regions in Europe was the subject of growth, spread, and changing social perspectives rather than a crisis in metal production and hiatus. This is the point, I think, at which we can embed one source of Bronze Age <b>weight</b> <b>standards</b> on the one hand, and earlier simpler methods of measuring copper, on the other...|$|R

2500|$|This coinage {{included}} {{the first modern}} gold coins with denominations in francs. It abandoned the revolutionary symbols of the coinage 1795, now showing Napoleon {{in the manner of}} Roman emperors, first described as [...] "Bonaparte Premier Consul" [...] and with the country described as [...] "République Française". The republican pretense faded fast. In 1804 coins changed the obverse legend to Napoleon Emperor, abandoning his family name in the manner of kings. In 1807, the reverse legend changed to describe France as an empire not a republic. In analogy with the old Louis d'or these coins were called Gold Napoleons. Economically, this sound money was a great success and Napoleon’s fall did not change that. Succeeding governments maintained Napoleon’s <b>weight</b> <b>standard,</b> with changes in design which traced the political history of France. In particular, this currency system was retained during the Bourbon Restoration and perpetuated until 1914.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of coinage in Italy the two important forms of value in the economy were sheep (pecus), from which the Latin word for money (pecunia) is derived, and irregularly shaped pieces of bronze known as aes rude (rough bronze) which needed to be weighed for each transaction. It is unclear when money became commonly used, but Roman tradition recorded that pay of the army began during the siege of Veii in 406 BC {{and it appears that}} Aes rude was the currency well before this. [...] Toward the end of the 4th century BC bronze began to be cast in flat bars which are known today, without any historical authority, as aes signatum (signed bronze). These bars were heavily leaded, of varying weights although generally on the order of five Roman pounds, and usually had a design on one and later both sides. The actual function of aes signatum has been variously interpreted; although a form of currency they were not coins since they did not adhere to a <b>weight</b> <b>standard.</b> Rome produced its own aes signatum around 300 BC which are distinguished by the inscription [...] "ROMANOM" [...] (of the Romans) and production continued to {{about the end of the}} first Punic war in 240 BC, overlapping some of the developments described below.|$|E
2500|$|Rome {{entered into}} a war against Tarentum in 281 BC; the Tarentines enlisted the support of Pyrrhus of Epirus. It was {{in this context that}} Rome {{produced}} its first Greek-style silver didrachm (Crawford 13/1) with the head of Mars wearing a Corinthian helmet {{on one side and the}} head of a horse with the inscription ROMANO (worn off on the example shown) and a grain ear behind. [...] This coinage may have predated the aes grave discussed above, but was minted and used largely in Magna Graecia and Campania. It was clearly part of a broader trend; payment of Roman and allied troops fighting in the Pyrrhic war appears to have been crucial in spreading the use of Greek-style coinage throughout the southern Apennine areas of Italy. This issue is today thought to have been minted in Neapolis because it was minted on that <b>weight</b> <b>standard</b> (7.3 g), not that of Metapontum, Tarentum, and other South Italian cities (which was 7.9 g at the start of the war but fell to 6.6 g during its course). This issue was thought earlier to have been minted in Metapontum because the grain-ear is the most common type on Metapontine coins and the Mars head is very similar to the head of Leucippus (a local hero, the Messenian king who re-founded Metapontum, not the philosopher) on an earlier coin produced there.|$|E
