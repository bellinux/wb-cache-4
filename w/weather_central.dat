2500|$|After the Leyte Gulf engagement, December {{found the}} Third Fleet confronted with another {{powerful}} enemy {{in the form}} of Typhoon Cobra which was dubbed [...] "Halsey's Typhoon" [...] by many. While conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some two hundred miles. Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction. However, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of December 17 the combat air patrol over Third Fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers. The pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean. The aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers. By 10:00am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. Still the fleet attempted to maintain stations. Finally, at 11:49a.m., Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them, something which many ships had already been forced to do. Between 11:00a.m. and 2:00p.m., the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in seventy-foot waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eighty-three knots with gusts well over 100 knots. At 1:45p.m. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet <b>Weather</b> <b>Central.</b> By this time the Third Fleet had already lost three destroyers. The storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet, with the loss of some 802 men and 146 aircraft. Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm, finally retiring for repairs at Ulithi on December 22.|$|E

40|$|StormCast is a {{distributed}} {{artificial intelligence}} application which aims at predicting severe storms in the Nordic part of the Northern hemisphere. The main strategy {{in the design and}} implementation of StormCast has been to decompose the application in a set of cooperating modules to meet the distributed nature of this kind of application. Scaleability, robustness and reusability are important objectives of this kind of application. Introduction StormCast is a {{distributed artificial intelligence}} application for severe storm forecasting (Hartvigsen and Johansen, 1988, 1989, 1990 a, 1990 b). We assume that the weather domain contains tasks which are distributed in their nature. In weather predictions, weather data from several geographical areas are collected by weather stations and processed by centralized <b>weather</b> <b>centrals.</b> Furthermore, several <b>weather</b> <b>centrals</b> exchange <b>weather</b> information in order to achieve a higher degree of accuracy. This kind of problem conducts the basis for Sto [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1947 the Analysis Center was {{combined}} with the Air Force Master Analysis Center and the Navy <b>Weather</b> <b>Central</b> to create the Weather Bureau-Air Force-Navy (WBAN) Analysis Center. Operations commenced on June 16, 1947, at 24th and M Streets NW. By early 1950 the WBAN Analysis Center consisted of 150 employees. Medium range forecasting was done nationally to 54 hours in the future. [...] Charts and maps were created at this facility for national distribution. [...] In July 1954 the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU) was created to test out numerical weather prediction (NWP) techniques by computer. This unit co-located with the WBAN analysis center to form the National Weather Analysis Center, which was located in Suitland, Maryland. When the two units merged, the name changed to the National Meteorological Center (NMC) in January 1958. When the JNWPU dissolved in 1961, NMC became an independent organization from Global <b>Weather</b> <b>Central</b> and Fleet Numerical <b>Weather</b> <b>Central.</b> Research and computer processing abilities increased over the years, which allowed for the first global forecast model to run by June 1966. By January 1975, much of the facility, minus the computers, moved to the World Weather Building, located in nearby Camp Springs, Maryland.|$|E
