The woman comes up to him at a truck stop and asks for a ride. The woman then robs a convenience store, and asks the man to drive away as the clerk is chasing her down. The man tells her that robbing the store was a big deal, while the woman thought that it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal.</b> He wonders {{what she was doing}} with a gun, and he also wonders how much money is in one of her bags.

The woman tries to fool one of the cops into letting her go, but the cop doesn't buy it. Travis Tritt plays the tow truck driver, who tows the man's car away with the man looking at it being towed away, and looking ashamed.|$|E

50|$|Power of 2 is one {{of several}} books - along with bestsellers Now, Discover Your Strengths and StrengthsFinder 2.0 - based on Gallup’s {{evidence}} that people flourish best when using their inherent talents. After summarizing studies indicating people generally overestimate their abilities where they are weak and underestimate them when they are strong, the authors advise: “So admit it: You stink at some things. You have blind spots, weaknesses, areas in which others seem to perform effortlessly while you struggle just to be average. You are also overly modest about your strengths. What seems to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> to you <b>is</b> difficult for others. Your strengths are stronger and your weaknesses weaker than you realize. You need help.

My topic here is the disjuncture between the perception on one side that something important and troubling has happened - or, as I will argue, may be about to happen - and the perception on the other that there is nothing to be concerned about. After describing in Section I the practice that has given rise to the controversy, I examine in Section II one feature of the controversy that, I believe, has not yet been addressed in detail: The target of criticism is not really what Justices of the Supreme Court have done, but rather what they might do. I then argue that the fact that the target is an imagined practice rather than the real one is a clue {{to the nature of the}} controversy. The controversy, I conclude in Section III, is a skirmish in the ongoing culture wars over the courts. The claims made against and for references to non-U. S. law in constitutional interpretation ought to be analyzed as cultural artifacts rather than as arguments, that is, in terms of the reasons given against and for the practice...|$|R
