5|$|It is {{not exactly}} known how many Jews were helped by Żegota, but {{at one point in}} 1943 it had 2,500 Jewish {{children}} under its care in Warsaw alone.

5|$|The Pechenegs {{destroyed}} the Hungarians' dwelling places. Those <b>who</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> double attack left the Pontic steppes {{and crossed the}} Carpathians {{in search of a}} new homeland.

The Hungarian name of the Pechenegs (besenyő) corresponds to the old Hungarian word for eagle (bese). Thus the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles' story of eagles compelling the Hungarians' ancestors to cross the Carpathians most probably refers to the Pechenegs' attack.|$|E
