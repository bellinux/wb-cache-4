5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, <b>with</b> <b>complete</b> <b>recovery</b> reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the least}} severe form of nerve injury, <b>with</b> <b>complete</b> <b>recovery.</b> In this case, the axon remains intact, but there is myelin damage causing an {{interruption}} in conduction of the impulse down the nerve fiber. Most commonly, this involves compression of the nerve or disruption to the blood supply (ischemia). There is a temporary loss of function which is reversible within hours to months of the injury (the average is 6-9 weeks). Wallerian degeneration does not occur, so recovery does not involve actual regeneration. There is frequently greater involvement of motor than sensory function with autonomic function being retained. In electrodiagnostic testing with nerve conduction studies, there is a normal compound motor action potential amplitude distal to the lesion at day 10, and this indicates a diagnosis of mild neuropraxia instead of axonotmesis or neurotmesis.|$|E

40|$|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an {{independent}} risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). If injury is mild, a repair process can be adaptive and lead to <b>complete</b> renal <b>recovery.</b> However, severe injury will {{be accompanied by a}} maladaptive repair which usually leads to nephron loss, fibrosis, vascular rarefaction, and chronic inflammation. Although various mechanisms underlying AKI-CKD transition have been explored, no intervention has been proved effective to block the transition until very recently. A lack of consensus for monitoring renal function and defining renal recovery after AKI should be the reasons for the slow advance in the discovery of a timely pharmacologic treatment to block AKI-CKD transition. Recently, animal studies have shown the activation of reninâ€“angiotensin system (RAS) after AKI. In patients <b>with</b> <b>complete</b> renal <b>recovery</b> after AKI defined as the decrease of serum creatinine level to within 0. 3 Â mg/dL above the baseline, administration of RAS inhibitor can prevent the ensuing CKD. In this review, we will discuss the renal recovery after AKI and the mechanisms underlying AKI-CKD transition. We will then highlight the promising effect of RAS inhibitor on CKD prevention in patients <b>with</b> <b>complete</b> renal <b>recovery</b> from AKI based on the recent clinical evidence...|$|R
