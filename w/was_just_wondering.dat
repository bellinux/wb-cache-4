As {{they began to}} read, the duo noticed {{that it had a}} {{tendency}} to take [...] "readers on a lot of side trips"—"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," [...] professed The Hollywood Reporter Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E

They {{were greeted by}} Ulster Unionist Party MLA, David McNarry, but denied a meeting by both deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness and Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams.

40|$|AbstractAt a {{time when}} the {{supremacy}} of SQUIDs as the most sensitive magnetometers is being challenged by the recent progress of optically pumped atomic magnetometers operating at room temperature, looking into new opportunities to further improve SQUIDs sensitivity would probably be most welcomed by the SQUID community. By far the most promising such opportunity is to operate a double (D) rf SQUID (an rf-SQUID in which a dc-SQUID is used instead of a single Josephson junction) in a non-adiabatic regime at frequencies of about a few GHz. At these relatively high frequencies required to assure an ultra-high SQUID sensitivity the SQUID-design complexity and the cost of the electronics involved (current generator and SQUID amplifier) are still kept at reasonable levels. The advantages of using this concept, as presented in my contribution in more detail now, are overwhelming. Ironically, although this idea in its preliminary shape has been around for some time now [1], the opportunity has never been explored experimentally! I <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what else {{needs to be done to}} get this message across the SQUID community and have this concept finally tested experimentally...|$|R
