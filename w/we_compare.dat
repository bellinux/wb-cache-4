2500|$|One of {{the ways}} to measure {{economic}} competitiveness is by comparing an extent of economic freedom that countries have, which as surveys show can also largely explain differences in economic well-being across the world.

In the second place, we are shown this relation still more clearly if <b>we</b> <b>compare</b> the extreme instances--Saturn and Mercury. The special contrast of these two, like the general contrast of the groups, points to the truth that low density, like the satellite-forming tendency, {{is associated with the}} ratio borne by centrifugal force to gravity; for in the case of Saturn with his many satellites and least density, centrifugal force at the equator is nearly 1/6th of gravity, whereas in Mercury with no satellite and greatest density centrifugal force is but 1/360th of gravity.|$|E
