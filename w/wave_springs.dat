40|$|AbstractWave springs are precise {{flat wire}} {{compression}} springs that fit into assemblies that other springs cannot since the overall lengths and operating heights of <b>Wave</b> <b>springs</b> {{are lower than}} those of conventional round Wire springs, they will often reduce the size of an assembly by as much as 50 %. Of course, this will also reduce the part weight and raw material cost of every spring produced. <b>Wave</b> <b>springs</b> operate as load bearing devices. They take up play and compensate for dimensional variations within assemblies. A virtually unlimited range of forces can be produced whereby loads build either gradually or abruptly to reach a predetermined working height. This establishes a precise spring rate in which load is proportional to deflection. Functional requirements are necessary for both dynamic and static spring applications. Special performance characteristics are individually built into each spring to satisfy a variety of precise operating conditions. Typically, a wave spring will occupy an externally small area for the amount of work it performs. The use of this product is demanded, but not limited to tight axial and radial space constraints. In this paper, a three dimensional finite element (FE) model for shock absorber spring is proposed. The present work deals the structural analysis for modelling the structural behaviour of <b>wave</b> <b>springs.</b> The design of spring in suspension system is very important. In this work a wave type of spring is designed and a 3 D model is created using Pro/Engineer. The model is also changed by changing the length of the spring. Structural analysis has been conducted on the wave spring by varying the spring material such as Structural steel and Beryllium Copper. For this analysis, loads are considered as bike weight, single person and two persons. Structural analysis is done to validate the strength. The present study makes an attempt to compare the results for selecting best material for springs...|$|E

The model profits from the adoption of Castigliano's theorem {{as a tool for}} mathematical treatment. Closed-form expressions for both load—deflection and load—stress relationships are presented. Because of the particular shape of the spring in the undeformed configuration, the load—deflection curve is found to be appreciably bilinear in character. A similar but less pronounced behaviour is displayed also by the relationship between load and internal stresses. The analytical results are compared to earlier theoretical findings and are shown to correlate well with experimental measurements...|$|E

40|$|Robust lithium/solid electrolyte/iodine {{electrochemical}} {{cells that}} offer significant advantages over commercial lithium/ iodine cells have been developed. At room temperature, these cells can be discharged at current densities 10 to 30 times those of commercial lithium/iodine cells. Moreover, from room temperature up to 80 C, the maximum discharge-current densities of these cells exceed those {{of all other}} solid-electrolyte-based cells. A cell of this type includes a metallic lithium anode in contact with a commercial flexible solid electrolyte film that, in turn, is in contact with an iodine/ graphite cathode. The solid electrolyte (the chemical composition of {{which has not been}} reported) offers the high ionic conductivity needed for high cell performance. However, the solid electrolyte exhibits an undesirable chemical reactivity to lithium that, if not mitigated, would render the solid electrolyte unsuitable for use in a lithium cell. In this cell, such mitigation is affected by the formation of a thin passivating layer of lithium iodide at the anode/electrolyte interface. Test cells of this type were fabricated from iodine/graphite cathode pellets, free-standing solid-electrolyte films, and lithium-foil anodes. The cathode mixtures were made by grinding together blends of nominally 10 weight percent graphite and 90 weight percent iodine. The cathode mixtures were then pressed into pellets at 36 kpsi (248 MPa) and inserted into coin-shaped stainless-steel cell cases that were coated with graphite paste to minimize corrosion. The solid-electrolyte film material was stamped to form circular pieces to fit in the coin cell cases, inserted in the cases, and pressed against the cathode pellets with polyethylene gaskets. Lithium-foil anodes were placed directly onto the electrolyte films. The layers described thus far were pressed and held together by stainless- steel shims, <b>wave</b> <b>springs,</b> and coin cell caps. The assembled cells were then crimped to form hermetic seals. It was found that the solid electrolyte films became discolored within seconds after they were placed in contact with the cathodes - a result of facile diffusion of iodine through the solid electrolyte material (see figure) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{finite element}} {{study of the}} contact pressure of running shoes was performed. The forces under consideration were those between the foot and the shoe. In particular, the methodology was employed to consider the merits of running shoes with passive springs in the heel and at {{the heads of the}} metatarsals. The main objective {{of the study was to}} verify how well the pressure was distributed on the foot in a dynamic landing, under dynamic loading, and general contact scenarios while walking and running wearing a Spira shoe sole. At the same time, a second analysis, with the same conditions, was performed employing a shoe sole. The computational analysis showed that higher plantar pressure concentrations were present when the foot dynamically interacted with the Spira shoe sole when walking and running. A three dimensional solid foot model was obtained from www. 3 dcadbrowser. com. The foot model was exported to Altair HyperMesh and discretized into ten node tetrahedral elements. The foot model was divided into two parts: an upper part that possessed osseous mechanical properties, and a lower part, which consisted of mechanical properties resembling those of the soft tissue. In addition, a Spira midsole was modeled employing NX 4. In the same way as the foot model, the midsole model was exported to Altair HyperMesh and discretized into ten node tetrahedral elements. Three sinusoidal <b>wave</b> <b>springs,</b> one insole, and one shoe cover were modeled using Altair HyperMesh and incorporated into the Spira midsole to complete the Spira shoe sole. A filling was also modeled using Altair HyperMesh and it was assimilated into an identical midsole in order to generate a normal shoe sole. LS-DYNA was employed to compute the non linear finite element analysis, due to interfacial general contact, in order to obtain the plantar pressure distribution on foot. ^ The peak pressures experienced at the heel when walking and wearing the normal shoe sole and the Spira shoe sole were 29. 63 psi and 47. 36 psi, respectively. The peak pressure on the heel area of the foot in the normal shoe sole, when running, was 30. 30 psi, and the peak pressure on the heads of the metatarsals was 39. 14 psi. The peak pressure experienced, when running, on the foot heel with the Spira sole was 59. 80 psi, and the peak pressure on the heads of the metatarsals was 56. 80 psi. Although higher pressure concentrations were present on the foot wearing the Spira shoe sole, the analysis also verified that the pressure distribution behavior was more favorable since it dispersed the high pressure concentration around the heel of the foot. ...|$|E
