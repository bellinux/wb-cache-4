40|$|Weldments {{geometry}} with failures {{occurring at}} the weld toe {{or at the}} weld root cannot, by its nature, be precisely defined. Parameters such as bead shape and toe or root radius vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. The worst case configuration {{can be achieved by}} modelling as a sharp, zero radius, notch both the toe and the weld root. The intensity of asymptotic stress distributions obeying Williams' solution is quantified by means of the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs). For steel welded joints with failures originated from the weld roots, where the lack of penetration zone is treated as a crack-like notch, units for NSIFs are the same as conventional SIFs used in LEFM. The different dimensionality of NSIFs for different notch opening angles does not allow a direct comparison of failures occurring at the weld toe or at the weld root. In order to overcome the problem related to the variability of the V-notch opening angle, a simple scalar quantity, i. e. the value of the strain energy density (SED) averaged in the structural volume surrounding the notch tip, has been introduced. This energy is given in closed form {{on the basis of the}} relevant NSIFs for modes I, II and III. The radius Rc of the averaging zone is carefully identified with reference to conventional arc welding processes being equal to 0. 28 mm for welded joints made of steel. The local-energy based criterion is applied here to steel <b>welded</b> <b>rollers</b> produced by Rulmeca and subjected to prevailing mode I (with failures at the weld root). The aim of the paper is firstly to describe the employed methodology for the fatigue assessment and secondly to show the first synthesis of fatigue data by means of local SED for a specific geometry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The article {{describes}} the main results in development of the manual ultrasonic tomograph for testing of welds in metallic objects. For development of small-size system {{it is appropriate to}} use the antenna array with direct excitation of shear wave in the testing object without using refracting prism. The system reconstructs the acoustic image of the defect using the SAFT-C algorithm. Introduction: During the last years tomographic methods is a very developing direction of ultrasonic non-destructive testing. Tomography lightens the methodology of testing and interpretation of signals. This is especially important at distinguishing the signals from the defects from the signals determined by the <b>weld</b> form (internal <b>roller,</b> facets and other).

40|$|Intentionally {{designed}} or accidentally caused, notches, cracks or defects {{are inevitably}} present in engineering components and can induce high stress gradients when a far field loading is applied. Then, structural strength assessments are {{often based on}} the local stress and strain state in the close neighbourhood of the stress raisers. The present PhD thesis is divided into six Chapters corresponding to different research topics, all related to new applications of important and widely employed local approaches to notched or cracked structural components. In the first Chapter, the adopted local approaches, namely the Notch Stress Intensity Factor-based approach (NSIF), the averaged Strain Energy Density (SED) criterion and the Peak Stress Method (PSM), are briefly introduced and described along with their theoretical frameworks. The second Chapter deals with brittle fracture under mixed mode static loading. A wide experimental campaign {{has been carried out}} on PMMA as well as on graphite cracked and notched specimens subjected to mixed mode I+II and I+III loading. Then, all experimental results have been reanalysed by means of the SED approach. The third Chapter deals with multiaxial fatigue loadings. First, the fatigue strength of severely notched titanium grade 5 alloy, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, has been investigated. Then, the SED criterion has been applied {{for the first time to}} an industrial case study, that is the multiaxial fatigue strength assessment of steel <b>welded</b> <b>rollers</b> produced by Rulmeca S. p. a. Finally, some remarks about the phase angle effect on sharp V-notched components under multiaxial fatigue have been drawn on the basis of a proposed analytical frame. The fourth Chapter addresses the numerical study of 3 D effects in notched and cracked components. Initially, the attention has been focused on coupled modes and on the effect of different boundary conditions in 3 D cracked discs and plates subjected to nominal mode III or mode II loading. Then, the presence of three-dimensional effects has been investigated both theoretically and numerically in blunt notched components under cyclic plasticity conditions. The fifth Chapter, instead, is related to the comparison between different fracture criteria. The SED approach and that based on the Finite Fracture Mechanics (FFM) have been compared considering sharp V-notches under pure mode I or mode II loading. Finally the sixth Chapter address the link between the SED approach and the Peak Stress Method (PSM). Cracks under in-plane mixed mode I+II and out-of-plane mixed mode I+III loading have been investigated. A method to rapidly evaluate the averaged SED based on the peak stresses at the crack tip has been proposed. On the basis of the derived link, some practical applications related to the fatigue strength assessment of aluminium and steel butt welded joints and of tube-to-flange steel welded joints have been carried out. ...|$|R

In {{view of the}} {{fracturing}} {{occurred at}} the welded joint of the belt conveyor roller while being in use in a coal mine of Fujian Province, the paper analyses the roller’s structure and stress in {{the basis of the}} transmission principle. It explores the reasons of the fracturing problem, and then proposes method to improve the <b>roller’s</b> <b>welding</b> technology. These are the cause of the roller fracturing，which the tension of the belt is great, and the roller itself is not strong enough, and welding process of steel plate is poor, and welding quality is not high. Use CO 2 and Ar mixed gas shielded arc welding to do backing weld, then use the welding method of automatic submerged arc welding. Finally the tempering to the welded joint part with the track-type far-infrared heater eliminate the welding residual stress. By actual use, it’s proved that the Welding Process Improvement is feasible, reasonable, reliable and practical. Statement of the Problem Belt conveyor is a kind of transport machinery with continuous movement using belt to double as the traction mechanism and the carrying bodies.

40|$|Fusion welding {{processes}} cause residual stress {{due to the}} uneven heat distribution produced by the moving welding torch. These residual stresses are characterised by a large tensile component in the welding direction. Due to the self-equilibrated nature of the residual stress, compressive ones {{are present in the}} far field next to the weld seam, which can cause different kind of distortion such as bending or buckling. Welding residual stress can be responsible of premature failure of the components, such as stress crack corrosion, buckling, and reduction of fatigue life. Localised rolling is a stress engineering technique {{that can be used to}} reduce the residual stress and distortion caused by welding. It induces plastic strain in the rolling direction, counteracting the plastic strain produced during welding. In this thesis three techniques were investigated, pre-weld rolling, post-weld rolling, and in situ rolling. These techniques have been seldom studied in the past, particularly pre-weld rolling; consequently the mechanisms are poorly understood. Finite element models allow stress and strain development during both welding and rolling processes to be better understood, providing an improved understanding of the mechanisms involved and aiding process development. A literature survey was done to find the state of the art of the computational welding mechanics simulations, stress management, and the residual stress measurement techniques, as well as the knowledge gaps such as, the thermal losses through the backing-bar in the thermal simulation, the frictional interaction in the rolling process, and the material properties of the steel used in the models. In the literature not many models that investigate the management of welding residual stress were found. After this, the general considerations and assumptions for the welding thermal mechanical models presented in this thesis were discussed. The effect of different backing-bar conditions, as well as different material properties where investigated. Both influenced the residual stress profile to varying degrees. In particular, temperature dependent heat loss to the backing-bar was necessary to capture the improved heat loss near the weld. The distortion predicted by the model was investigated to determine whether it was due to bending or buckling phenomena. Lastly, the temperature distribution and residual stress predictions were validated against thermocouple and neutron diffraction measurements conducted by Coules et al. [1 – 3]. Pre-weld rolling was the first of the three rolling methods considered, in which rolling is applied to the plates before performing GMA butt-welds. The principle behind this technique consisted in inducing tensile residual stress in the weld region before welding; therefore, it is similar to mechanically tensioning the weld, which can significantly reduce the residual stress and distortion. However, there was no significant change in the tensile residual stresses. On the other hand, it was possible to achieve a small reduction in the distortion, when the plates were rolled on the opposite surface to the weld; rolling in this way induced distortion in the opposite direction to the distortion induced by welding, reducing the magnitude of the latter. These results were compared with experiments conducted by Coules et al. [1, 4]. A subsequent investigation combined pre-weld rolling with post-weld heating. With this additional process the residual stress and distortion were significantly reduced, and flatter residual stress profile was achieved. The post-weld rolling and in situ rolling techniques were discussed afterwards. In the post-weld rolling models, rolling was applied after the weldment was cooled to room temperature. In in situ rolling the roller was applied on top of the weld bead at some distance behind the torch, while it was still hot. The principle behind these techniques consisted in applying positive plastic strain to the weld bead region by a roller, counteracting the negative plastic strains produced in the <b>welding</b> process. Two <b>roller</b> profiles were investigated, namely, grooved, and double flat rollers. The post-weld rolling on top of the weld bead models, which used the grooved roller, showed good agreement against experimental results, producing a large reduction of the residual stress and distortion. Some discrepancies were present when the weld toes were rolled with the dual flat roller. The former roller was more efficient for reducing residual stress and distortion. The influence of different friction coefficients (between the roller and weldment, and between the backing-bar and the weldment), were investigated. It showed significant dependency on the residual stress distribution when high rolling loads were used. The frictional interaction constrained the contact area inducing more compressive stress in the core of the weld bead; therefore it produced more tensile residual stress in the surface of the weldment. Additionally, the influence of rolling parameters on the through-thickness residual stress variation was investigated. Low loads only influence the residual stress near the surface, while high loads affected the material through the entire thickness. When the dual flat roller was used to roll next to the weld bead, significant compressive residual stress was induce in the weld bead; however, the residual stress reduction was very sensitive to the contact of the <b>roller</b> to the <b>weld</b> toes; therefore, when rolling a weld bead that varies in shape along the weld, the residual stress reduction is not uniform and varies along the length. On the other hand, the in situ rolling did not produced significant residual stress or distortion reduction in all the cases analysed. The rolling occurred when the material was still hot and the residual stress was subsequently formed as the material cooled to room temperature. Numerical modelling was a very useful tool for understanding the development of stress and plastic strain during the welding and rolling processes...|$|R
