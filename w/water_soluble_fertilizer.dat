40|$|The isotopic {{exchange}} kinetic (IEK) method allows assessing {{the rate of}} orthophosphate ions (Pi) exchange between the solid phase and {{the solution of the}} soil with time. However, two challenges have to be tackled when using this technique in soils with a very low water extractable Pi concentration (CP) and with a high sorbing capacity for Pi. The first is that current colorimetric methods do not allow quantifying Pi concentrations lower than 10 ?g P L? 1. While the second challenge is that a significant fractionation between P isotopes may occur in the soil solution system in the presence of soils with high Pi sorption capacity. We assessed here: i) whether concentrating the blue phosphomolybdate complex (BPMC) in hexanol prior to its measurement would allow to lower the detection and quantification limits of Pi, ii) whether a significant isotopic fractionation between 32 Pi and 33 Pi could occur during IEK experiments conducted in the presence of high Pi sorbing substrates (e. g., pure goethite or Malagasy soils) and iii) whether the IEK method when used in conjunction with the hexanol concentration of the BPMC to measure CP would detect changes in Pi {{isotopic exchange}}ability in a ferralsol cropped with upland rice following the input of manure or <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The detection and quantification limits of the BPMC concentrated by hexanol were 0. 3 and 0. 8 ?g P L? 1, respectively, using a cell of 10 cm length for the colorimetric measurement. The IEK conducted on Pi amended goethite and on Malagasy soils with 32 Pi and 33 Pi did not show any systematic isotopic fractionation between both isotopes, suggesting that in these soils 31 Pi and 32 Pi or 33 Pi have a similar behavior during isotopic exchange. The analysis of the soils sampled in the field experiment showed {{a significant increase in the}} amount of Pi isotopically exchangeable after 1 min only after the application of water soluble P. This increase was paralleled by increases in rice yield and P export by grains demonstrating an increased P availability in this treatment. In conclusion, the IEK method can be used in low P and high Pi sorbing soils as the hexanol concentration method allows measuring very low CP and as the different P isotopes have a similar behavior in the soil/solution system. The IEK experiments conducted in the presence of goethite, however, point out to the necessity of taking into account the dispersion of particles for a proper interpretation of the isotopic data.

In addition, we mixed the phosphate and potassic sources with earthworm compost enriched in N by inoculation with diazotrophic bacteria (OM) and applied at 50, 100 and 150 % of the recommended dosage rate (RDR). The PK biofertilizer with OM enriched in N positively affected sugarcane height, yield, and industrial characteristics. The application of SFMC greatly increased available P and K in the soil and plant characteristics with residual effect in the two consecutive harvests.

An isolate of Phytophthora capsici Leonian was cultured to induce sporulation. Spore dilutions were placed in aliquots of reverse osmosis water and bubbled with ozone gas (O 3) to concentrations of 0 to 1. 5 mg?L- 1.

Turbidity effects on efficacy on Phytophthora capsici were tested using bentonite clay at 0 to 2. 0 nephelometric turbidity units and ozone concentrations of 0 to 1. 5 mg? L- 1.

The yield of crude chitosan and <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> chitosan was 54. 3 % and 87. 8 %. The FT-IR spectrum of chitin, chitosan and <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> chitosan also determined and characterization {{was done and}} compared with standards. Compare to other bacterial strains S. auerus (18. 3 mm) having more potential antibacterial activity in crude chitosan as well as <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> chitosan. Both chitosans might have the antibacterial activity which would be used in novel drugs from the shrimp shell waste.

Franco) {{seedlings}} {{and grown}} under {{two levels of}} <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and one level of slow-release fertilizer. Both fungi formed abundant C 514 %) ectomycorrhizae under the <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizer</b> regimes. Slow-release fertilizer gratly reduced percent ectomycorrhizae for both fungi. Stern height was significantly increased under low fertility with all basidiospore application rates of R. colossus and the three lowest application rates of H. vinicolor. High fertility significantly increased ectomycorrhizae at all application rates of 1. colossus. The HIGH fertility regime produced plantable Douglas-fir seedlings with abundant ectomycorrhizae of R. colossus and H. vinicolor. Five different conifers grown in a bareroot nursery were inoculated with three basidiospore rates of seven hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two Douglas-fir seed sources wer...|$|R

40|$|Phytotoxic {{activity}} of single and combined application of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> and volatile compounds of Cistus ladanifer on germination and early root growth of subterranean clover. Was investigated. Total germination, lag {{and speed of}} germination were both inhibited and stimulated, with the {{activity of}} volatiles on total germination depending upon the presence of <b>water</b> <b>solubles.</b> Antagonism between <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> and volatiles was always found, resulting in a reduction of inhibition or a shift from inhibition to stimulation. It is suggested that the simultaneous presence of <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> and volatiles might result in changes of the chemical nature of metabolites released by C. ladanifer. Early root growth was always inhibited but only by <b>water</b> <b>solubles,</b> and no interaction was found. The ecological implications of these results are {{discussed in terms of}} the exhaustion of competitors seedbanks by a two-step process in which germination is less inhibited or even stimulated by <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> and volatiles, followed by a stronger and volatiles-independent inhibition of early root growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{solubility}} enhancement {{process of}} hydrophobic drugs {{plays a key}} role in the formulation development to achieve the bioavailability and therapeutic action of the drug at the target site. As estimated, among the newly discovered chemical entities nearly 40 % drugs are poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble.</b> To get proper therapeutic level of drug in plasma, a high dose of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs is required. The orally administered drugs show its complete pharmacological effect if it is fairly <b>soluble</b> in <b>water</b> in gastric medium and such drugs show good bioavailability. The enhancement of oral bioavailability of such poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs remains one of the most challenging aspects of drug development. Various methods are used to enhance the solubility of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs in aqueous medium. In this present study, surfactant micellization method was used to enhance the solubility of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs viz. glibenclamide, clofibrate. A carbohydrate based non-ionic surfactants, which was synthesized in lab, were explored to encapsulate these drugs. It was found that the water solubility of these drugs increased up to many folds.

40|$|The use of {{pig slurry}} (PS) as {{fertilizer}} {{can affect the}} soil quality and increase total stocks of soil organic carbon (TOC). However, the effects of PS on TOC amount and forms in the soil are not fully understood, particularly in areas under no-tillage (NT). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine TOC contents and stocks in the particulate (POC) and mineral-associated C fractions (MAC) of an Oxisol after nine years of maize-oat rotation under NT, with annual applications of PS, <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and combined fertilization (pig slurry + <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizer).</b> The experiment was initiated in 2001 in Campos Novos, Santa Catarina, with the following treatments: PS at rates of 0 (without fertilization - PS 0); 25 (PS 25); 50 (PS 50); 100 (PS 100); and 200 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1 (PS 200); fertilization with <b>soluble</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (SF); and mixed fertilization (PS + SF). The TOC content was determined in samples of six soil layers to a depth of 40 cm, and the POC and MAC contents in four layers to a depth of 20 cm. From the rate of 50 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1 and upwards, the soil TOC content and stock increased according to the PS rates in the layers to a depth of 10 cm. The POC and MAC contents and stocks were higher in the surface layers, with a clear predominance of the second fraction, but a greater relative amplitude in the contents of the first fraction...|$|R
