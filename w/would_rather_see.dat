5|$|Recent {{attempts}} {{to develop the}} area between the park's western edge and High Street have proved controversial; Bristol City Council are keen to replace derelict buildings with a mixed-use development to help reconnect the Old City to Broadmead and raise funds to improve the park; others <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the park extended to High Street.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
25|$|Bill and Denise Richard, {{parents of}} the {{youngest}} of the three killed in the bombings, urged against a death sentence for Tsarnaev. They stated that the lengthy appeals period would force them to continually relive that day, and <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> him spend life in prison without possibility of release.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, an {{attempt was made}} to name the college after Martin Luther King, but failed when UCSD {{students}} objected to naming the college after someone who was charged with plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation. More to the point, King's family announced that they <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> a full-fledged King College built in the South, and preferable in Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|Prodi's {{government}} faced {{a crisis}} over policies in early 2007, after just {{nine months of}} government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved {{the expansion of the}} US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member UDEUR Populars, said he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.|$|E
25|$|Within the Liberal Democrats, the {{two main}} ideological strands are social liberals and the {{classical}} liberals, the latter supporting economic liberalism. The principal {{difference between the two}} is that the classical liberals tend to support greater choice and competition and aim to increase social mobility through economic deregulation and creation of opportunity, whereas the social liberals were more commonly associated with directly aiming to increase equality of outcome through state intervention. Correspondingly, classical liberals tended to favour cutting taxes for the poorest in order to increase opportunity, contrasting with social liberals, who <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> higher spending on public services and the disadvantaged in order to reduce income inequality.|$|E

25|$|At 2pm a 12-pound cannon and {{a company}} of militia were sent up by a special train. By afternoon, the {{shooting}} from the hotel had ceased. The police leader, Superintendent Sadleir, decided to {{set fire to the}} hotel and received permission from the Chief Secretary, Robert Ramsay. At 2:50pm a final volley was fired into the hotel, and under cover of the fire, Senior-constable Charles Johnson, of Violet Town, placed a bundle of burning straw at the hotel's west side. As the fire took hold, the police began to close in on the building. Mrs Skillion and Kate Kelly appeared on the scene at this juncture. The former endeavoured to make way to her brothers, declaring she <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> them burned than shot by the police. The police, however, ordered her to stop.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1940, Ribbentrop made a {{sustained}} but unsuccessful effort to have Spain enter the war on the Axis side. During his talks with the Spanish foreign minister, Ramón Serrano Súñer, Ribbentrop affronted Súñer with his tactless behaviour, especially his suggestion that Spain cede the Canary Islands to Germany. An angry Súñer replied that he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the Canaries sink into the Atlantic then cede an inch of Spanish territory. An area in which Ribbentrop enjoyed more success arose in September 1940, {{when he had the}} Far Eastern agent of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Dr. Heinrich Georg Stahmer, start negotiations with the Japanese foreign minister, Yōsuke Matsuoka, for an anti-American alliance. The end result of these talks was the signing in Berlin on 27 September 1940 of the Tripartite Pact by Ribbentrop, Count Ciano, and Japanese Ambassador Saburo Kurusu.|$|E
25|$|Service members {{requiring}} observation or care {{beyond the}} unit level are evacuated to facilities {{in close proximity}} to, but separate from the medical or surgical patients at the BAS, surgical support company in a central location (Marines) or forward support/division support or area support medical companies (Army) nearest the service members' unit. It is best to send Service members who cannot continue their mission and require more extensive respite to a central facility other than a hospital, unless no other alternative is possible. The Service member must be encouraged to continue to {{think of himself as}} a war fighter, rather than a patient or a sick person. The chain of command remains directly involved in the Service member's recovery and return to duty. The CSC team coordinates with the unit's leaders to learn whether the over-stressed individual was a good performer prior to the combat stress reaction, or whether he was always a marginal or problem performer whom the team <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> replaced than returned. Whenever possible, representatives of the unit, or messages from the unit, tell the casualty that he is needed and wanted back. The CSC team coordinates with the unit leaders, through unit medical personnel or chaplains, any special advice on how to assure quick reintegration when the Service member returns to his unit.|$|E

However, Geiss is not {{interested}} in Tracy's $35 million project, even after Tracy uses NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Grizz Griswold (Grizz Chapman) and [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) to put together a trailer for the film. After failing to convince Geiss, who <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> him do a sequel to one of Tracy's previous films, Fat Bitch, Tracy decides that he will make Jefferson on his own.|$|E

He noted that the audio quality was [...] "pretty strong," [...] and allows listeners to clearly hear every chord, note, and word that the band outputs, while the crowd noise proves that it is a live video, but is not so loud that it distracts viewers. Beamount also said that the video's quality [...] "lacks a lot of the polish that more recent recordings have," [...] but he later said that he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> it in low quality rather than high quality.

500|$|The city's goal is {{to create}} a mixed-use {{development}} with green space and affordable housing. By April 2017, a special committee had narrowed the search for a plan and site developer down to five proposals. In May 2017, the Barry administration selected a proposal called Cloud Hill by the Nashville-based Mathews Company and backed by music producer T Bone Burnett. The proposed redevelopment of the 21-acre site includes music and art space, a community center, open park space, and affordable housing. The footprint of the baseball diamond and outfield would be turned into the Great Lawn, a [...] green space accommodating amateur baseball and soccer. Renderings show the guitar scoreboard and a portion of the outfield wall intact. The plan, which awaits final approval by Metro Parks and the Metro Council, has been met with concerns by citizens and groups whom <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the property restored entirely to parkland and the site's history preserved. Other concerns have been raised over the lack of transparency in the city's planning process and the privatization of publicly owned land.|$|E

500|$|The King had a mixed {{relationship}} with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, {{such as the}} devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead {{to the loss of}} the colony. At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to Lord Gosford, Governor General-designate of Canada: [...] "Mind what you are about in Canada... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, I will have them impeached." [...] When William's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week, William gloomily replied, [...] "I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> the devil than any one of them in my house." [...] Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform. Despite his disagreements with Lord Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady Caroline Norton—he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought. The King and Prime Minister eventually found a modus vivendi; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.|$|E

He stated {{that if he had}} to choose, he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>see</b> America allied with Nazi Germany than Soviet Russia. He preferred Nordics, but he believed, after Soviet Communism was defeated, Russia would be a valuable ally against potential aggression from East Asia.|$|E
