In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally. He later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.|$|E

If no better governing body is possible than the stupid, dilatory and forensic assemblies that rule in France, Britain and America to-day, then the civilised human community has reached its climax. That more comprehensive collective handling of the common interests to which science and intelligent Socialism point, that collective handling which is already urgently needed if the present uncontrolled <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> and the ultimate bankruptcy of mankind is to be avoided, is quite beyond the capacity of such assemblies; already there is too much in their clumsy and untrustworthy hands, and the only course open to us is an attempt at enlightened Individualism, an attempt to limit and restrict State activities in every possible way, and to make little private temporary islands of light and refinement amidst the general disorder and decay. All collectivist schemes, all rational Socialism, if only Socialists would realise it, all hope for humanity, indeed, are dependent ultimately upon the hypothetical possibility of a better system of government than any at present in existence.|$|E

The analysis is carried out in terms of ecofeminist theories and environmental justice conceptualisations. Winterson’s novel focuses on exploitative systems that devalue nature and socially underprivileged humans who have greater risks of exposition to environmentally degraded spaces. In her novel, waste is caused by careless and greedy human activities, which undervalue both the importance of the environment as well as the role and survival of other people.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the value of}} the exergetic life cycle {{assessment}} (ELCA) has been analysed. The ELCA uses the framework of the life cycle assessment (LCA) and {{can be seen as the}} exergy analysis of a complete life cycle. The value of the ELCA besides the LCA has been discussed. It is shown that the ELCA is a more appropriate instrument to quantify the environmental problem of the depletion <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> This has been tested with a case study <b>of</b> different <b>waste</b> wood treatment routes. In the first model waste wood is co-combusted in a coal power plant, while in the second model waste wood has been used to produce chipboard. The ELCA shows that the production of chipboard gives less depletion <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> Furthermore, in model 3 and 4 coal for generating electricity has been replaced by green wood. The ELCA shows that replacing coal by green wood gives less depletion <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> than replacing the waste wood with green wood, while the waste wood is used for generating electricity. However, comparing the four models it can be seen that replacing coal by green wood causes more <b>wasting</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources,</b> while the depletion <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> decreases. It can be concluded that the ELCA can be used in two ways. First, the ELCA can be used to determine the consumption <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> and second, the ELCA can be used to calculate the depletion <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> In the latter case, a distinction has been made between renewable and non-renewable exergy resources...|$|R

He conversed with movie stars, society women, farmers, and fellow writers like Upton Sinclair. In his commentary, Salten is both admiring and critical. For instance, he adores natural monuments like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite National Park but also deplores the <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources,</b> deforestation that has caused erosion, and the excess of automobiles. Often his tone is ironic when he describes everyday phenomena like advertising or large movie theaters for his European readers.

50|$|Another factor {{yet to be}} {{considered}} by the EPA and DOE is the overall effect of energy-saving requirements on the durability and expected service life of a mass-market appliance built to a consumer-level cost standard. For example, a refrigerator may be made more efficient {{by the use of}} more insulative spacing and a smaller-capacity compressor using electronics to control operation and temperature. However, this may come at the cost of reduced interior storage (or increased exterior mass) or a reduced service life due to compressor or electronic failures. In particular, electronic controls used on new-generation appliances are subject to damage from shock, vibration, moisture, or power spikes on the electrical circuit to which they are attached. Critics have pointed out that even if a new appliance is energy efficient, any consumer appliance that does not provide customer satisfaction, or must be replaced twice as often as its predecessor contributes to landfill pollution and <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> used to construct its replacement.|$|E

Around 1909, Rungius gave up illustrating to pursue a career as a full-time easel painter. His illustrations, however, stayed in circulation long after, playing a large role in spreading information about ethical hunting. In early twentieth-century North America, there were few major zoos and photography was still in its infancy, so illustrations from books and periodicals were the public's main source of information concerning wildlife.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the {{equality}} principle {{can be applied to}} traditional mining activities as a theoretical economic basis for "environmentally friendly" <b>waste</b> management <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> A cost structure is proposed to generally improve the exploitation <b>of</b> the <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> and save energy due to the promotion of corporate economic incentives to a more cost-effective waste management related to these resources. The methodology proposed is based on the cost-benefit analysis concept. It employs the previously introduced equality principle and the model for Efficient Use of Resources for Optimal Production Economy (EUROPE) featuring shadow prices so as to optimize the mining slope and the ore-concentration when utilizing the resources of the rock and provide management with a one digit indicator of the performance of a certain mining activity to get in just once glance an instant comprehension of their mine's overall performance. This approach simultaneously improves the profitability, the technology used and the environment. A case study presents the practical application of the proposed theory on a Swedish copper mine. It is concluded that the presented methodology improves the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> in mainly technological, economical and environmental terms.

Data of crop production (barley, bean, corn, cotton, soybean and wheat) as a function of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilization were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk data transformation (L-B), that allows to calculate the amount of a specific nutrient needed to reach half (k s) or other percentages of the theoretical maximum response (k max) and the efficiency of fertilizer use (kg of grain/kg of fertilizer). The efficiency of fertilizer use presented exponential decay by increasing fertilization: 55 to 3; 63 to 5; and 47 to 1 kg of corn/kg of fertilizer, by increasing nitrogen, P 2 O 5 and potassium from 40 to 200; 40 to 200; and 60 to 300 kg ha - 1, respectively.
