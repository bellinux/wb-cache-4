500|$|The Guardian praised Duff's {{decision}} {{to opt for}} a more electronic dance sound {{as opposed to the}} teen pop of her previous work, despite the questionable marketability. They argued that some of the album's strongest tracks rivaled some by Kylie Minogue. [...] Sputnikmusic's review noted various flaws of the album, such as what they felt were a lackluster guitar solo on the song [...] "I Wish" [...] and Duff's childish, uncharacterized vocals throughout. However, they continued, [...] "For all its inadequacies, Dignity is a solid, constructed pop album. Like all albums of the genre not written solely by the performer, it's never quite clear which parts, if any, are Duff's words and which represent the feelings of the under-appreciated co-writer, but in Dignity <b>we</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> have an album where it's worthwhile listening to the lyrics." [...] They praised the songwriting of every track except [...] "Play with Fire", which they felt was a poor choice for a lead single.|$|E
