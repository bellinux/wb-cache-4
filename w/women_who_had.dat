5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been in psychotherapy than for <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not.|$|E

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> have been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> have been an obscure group. Conclusion: The conclusion was that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> have not been included in the STI information available on the internet within the county councils of Kalmar and Kronoberg...|$|R
5|$|The colonial outpost was a {{traditional}} New England subsistence farming community.

5|$|After the war, some <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been {{especially}} active {{in supporting the}} war {{on the home front}} turned their organizational skills to other concerns, especially prohibition and woman suffrage. In 1874, for example, Zerelda Wallace, the wife of former Indiana governor David Wallace and stepmother of General Lew Wallace, became a founder of the Indiana chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> formed attachments with RNR soldiers.

The obstetric history of a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had four pregnancies, one of which was a miscarriage before 20 weeks, would be noted as G4P3A1 (in the UK this is written as G4P3+1).

5|$|Kinsey and {{his staff}} {{reported}} that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female. Of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> sexual contact with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence of homosexual activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported they got married to stop homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{demobilisation}} began {{during the}} final years of the war. In order {{to meet the needs of}} the war economy 20,000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> completed five years of service, including at least two years outside Australia, could volunteer for discharge.|$|E
5|$|On {{the anniversary}} of her birth, in 1814, the widowed King Frederick William instituted the Order of Louise (Luisenorden) as a {{complementary}} decoration for the Iron Cross.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had abortions report different levels of well-being than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not had abortions, and to examine the possible moderating effect of perceived status of the fetus. We hypothesized that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> abortion(s) and <b>who</b> believe the fetus is human will have a more difficult postabortion adjustment than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> believe the fetus is less than human. We also hypothesized that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had abortions would consider maternal-related facets of their self-concepts less important than would <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not had abortions in order to preserve their self-esteem. Subjects were obtained through physician's offices and were categorized into three pregnancy history groups: the Abortion Group (N= 132), the Never Pregnant Group (N= 209), and the Other Outcomes Group (N= 476). The scales used to measure well-being were: The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Rosenberg?s Self-Esteem Scale, The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and a scale measuring 12 specific facets of the self-concept The Beliefs About the Fetus Scale, devised by the authors, measured the women's perceived status of the fetus. It was found that women in the Abortion group reported slightly lower well-being than women in the Other Outcomes Group. It was also found that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> abortions and <b>who</b> tended to believe the fetus was human scored lower on measures of well-being than the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> tended to believe the fetus was not human, whereas the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not believe the fetus was human were no different on the well-being measures than the other two groups. The implications of these findings and their relationships with previous research findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 2009 General Social Survey on victimization, this study {{examines}} the relationship between Canadian women’s past experiences of sexual and physical victimization within {{the past five years}} and their subsequent engagement in self-protective behaviour. Self-protective behaviour is divided into three categories, including self-defense class enrollment, weapon carrying and overall protection (combines self-defense class and weapons). Three hypotheses are examined. Firstly, this study looks at whether <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been victimized (regardless of type) are more likely to practice self-protective behaviour than their non-victim counterparts. Then, within the victims-only group, this study looks at whether <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been sexually victimized are {{more likely to engage in}} self-protective behaviour than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced physical victimization, or whether the impact of physical and sexual victimization are similar. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between past experiences of victimization and engaging in self-protection. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been victimized are more likely to enroll in a self-defense class, carry a weapon and engage in overall protection in comparison to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not been victimized. Furthermore, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced sexual victimization are more likely to engage in overall protection than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced physical victimization. When self-defense class enrollment and weapon carrying are analyzed separately however, the impact of physical and sexual victimization is not statistically different when the control variables are included. This suggests that separating self-defense class enrollment and weapon carrying might hide the full impact of sexual victimization on women’s insecurity and need for self-protection...|$|R

5|$|After the {{breakout}} of the First World War, Morton travelled to Labrador {{to work in}} the Mission Hospitals there, {{before being}} made a special commissioner of the Red Cross to take supplies from Paris to the Macedonian Front and work at the field hospitals in Macedonia. Following the success of her male family members, Morton was the first women to become the Attending Surgeon at the Vanderbilt Clinic of Columbia University's Physicians and Surgeons in 1916. After returning to New York Morton, alongside Mary M. Crawford, led the American Women's Hospitals Service from 1917 after it was founded by the Medical Women's National Association with the aim of establishing American hospitals in Europe. After her request to send one thousand medical <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> volunteered for foreign service was opposed by the General Medical Board in Washington, she raised over $300,000 in 10 days through a national fundraising drive to send them. At the recommendation of William C.

5|$|Few inmates {{remained}} in the camp after the gassings stopped, mostly non-Jewish <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been married to Jews. They were released several days later, after being sworn to secrecy. Apart from Sajmište inmates, the 500 patients and staff of the Belgrade Jewish Hospital, as well as Jewish prisoners from the nearby Banjica concentration camp, were also killed in the gas van. The last Jewish prisoner in Sajmište was killed on 8 May 1942, and the gas van used at the camp was returned to Berlin on 9 June 1942. It received a technical upgrade there, and was then transferred to Belarus where {{it was used to}} gas Jews in Minsk. Shortly after leading the extermination of the Jewish inmates in Sajmište, Andorfer and Enge were assigned different Security Police roles. Andorfer later received an Iron Cross 2nd Class for running the camp, and won a promotion.|$|E
