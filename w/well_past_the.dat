Dilution typically continues <b>well</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> point where no molecules of the original substance remain.

He thus became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life, traveling on a Nansen passport.

25|$|Throughout the period, men wore {{their hair}} long with curls <b>well</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward {{and allowed to}} flow over the {{forehead}} a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, {{the popularity of the}} wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due {{to the success of the}} wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell <b>well</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, Monseigneur was well known for wearing blond wigs.|$|E
