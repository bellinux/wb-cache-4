5|$|The {{battle was}} covered in detail by Time, and Arafat's face {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} the 13 December 1968 issue, bringing his image to the world for the first time. Amid the post-war environment, the profiles of Arafat and Fatah were raised by this important turning point, and he came to be regarded as a national hero <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to confront Israel. With mass applause from the Arab world, financial donations increased significantly, and Fatah's weaponry and equipment improved. The group's numbers swelled as many young Arabs, including thousands of non-Palestinians, joined the ranks of Fatah.|$|E

5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats {{shuffling}} tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{portrayed as}} an {{imaginary}} {{character in a}} schizophrenia storyline, Rae was later revealed to be real when she arrived to study in Hollyoaks. She was central to a controversial suicide storyline, and {{was part of a}} love triangle with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), which left her pregnant by Ste. She miscarried during an argument with Brendan and subsequently feuded with him; Barlow praised her character for being one of the few <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to oppose the Hollyoaks villain. Rae was originally characterised as a chav with a feisty persona, but underwent a transformation when she attempted to embrace domestic life with Ste. During series four of the post-watershed spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Rae was murdered by a serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). The late broadcast slot allowed an explicit depiction of her death. Barlow hoped that Rae would be remembered for her strong-willed nature, and that her exit would be considered {{one of the best in}} the programme's history.|$|E
5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> not dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E

25|$|The {{raising of}} capital in Rotterdam did not go so smoothly. A {{considerable}} part originated from inhabitants of Dordrecht. Although it did not raise as much capital as Amsterdam or Middelburg-Zeeland, Enkhuizen had the largest input in the share capital of the VOC. Under the first 358 shareholders, there were many small entrepreneurs, <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to take the risk. The minimum investment in the VOC was 3,000 guilders, which priced the Company's stock within the means of many merchants.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that the Corleonesi waged their {{campaign}} to dominate Cosa Nostra, they also waged a campaign of murder against journalists, officials, and policemen <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to cross them. The police were frustrated with the lack of help that they were receiving from witnesses and politicians. At the funeral of a policeman murdered by mafiosi in 1985, policemen insulted and spat at two attending politicians, and a fight broke out between them and military police.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable Japanese surgeon of the Edo period, Hanaoka was famous for {{combining}} Dutch and Japanese surgery and introducing modern surgical techniques to Japan. Hanaoka successfully operated for hydrocele, anal fistula, and even performed certain kinds of plastic surgery.

25|$|Following his conversion, Umar went {{to inform}} the chief of Quraish, Amr ibn Hishām, about his {{acceptance}} of Islam. According to one account, Umar thereafter openly prayed at the Kaaba as the Quraish chiefs, Amr ibn Hishām and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, reportedly watched in anger. This further helped the Muslims to gain confidence in practicing Islam openly. At this stage Umar even challenged anyone <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to stop the Muslims from praying, although no one dared to interfere with Umar when he was openly praying.|$|E
25|$|This made Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, who {{was then}} MIC vice-{{president}}, bitter as {{he felt he was}} being sidelined.

Sambanthan and propel Manickavasagam to the presidency of the party.Subramaniam, then the secretary general of MIC, was hand-picked by Manickavasagam to become deputy president and succeed him. However, Samy Vellu fought back, literally, and in the 1977 party elections he managed to beat Subramaniam by a mere 26 votes to become the Deputy President of MIC.|$|E

25|$|A Thomas Reuters Foundation survey {{says that}} India {{is the fourth}} most {{dangerous}} {{place in the world}} for women to live in. Women belonging to any class, caste, creed or religion can be victims of this cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim permanently and act as a lesson to put a woman in her place. In India, acid attacks on women <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and the quickest way to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks have been rising.|$|E
25|$|Historically Norwegians {{considered}} {{what they}} called Lussinatten the longest night {{of the year and}} no work was to be done. From that night until Christmas, spirits, gnomes and trolls roamed the earth. Lussi, a feared enchantress, punished anyone <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> work. Legend also has it that farm animals talked to each other on Lussinatten, and that they were given additional feed on this longest night of the year. The Lussinatt, the night of 13 December, was largely forgotten in Norway {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, though still remembered as an ominous night, and also celebrated in some areas, especially in Mid, Central and Eastern inland.|$|E
25|$|Orion's current name {{derives from}} Greek mythology, in which Orion was a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter of ancient times, born to Euryale, a Gorgon, and Poseidon (Neptune), {{god of the}} sea in the Graeco-Roman tradition. One myth recounts Gaia's rage at Orion, <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> {{to say that he}} would kill every animal on the planet. The angry goddess tried to {{dispatch}} Orion with a scorpion. This is given as the reason that the constellations of Scorpius and Orion are never in the sky at the same time. However, Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, revived Orion with an antidote. This {{is said to be the}} reason that the constellation of Ophiuchus stands midway between the Scorpion and the Hunter in the sky.|$|E

25|$|By 9:00 am Kray and his {{officers}} managed to reorganize their troops when an order arrived from Suvorov {{to renew the}} attack. Once more the Austrians attacked the heights and once more they were defeated with loss. While Clausel and Richepanse helped repulse Bellegarde's division, Partouneaux counterattacked Ott. Encouraged by his success, Partouneaux unwisely charged down into the plain where his troops were scattered by four squadrons of the Archduke Joseph Hussars and Kaiser Dragoons. Partouneaux was among those captured. After the repulse of his second attack, Kray massed a 40-gun battery with which he bombarded any French troops <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to line the crest. But the Austrian general refused to launch more attacks until {{the rest of the}} army joined the fight. Suvorov had planned to encircle a French army in motion. The unexpected circumstances threw the Allied plan out of gear.|$|E
25|$|Pius X on his {{election}} made two decisions. He formally abolished the veto of heads of state, declaring that anyone <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> introduce a civil veto in the conclave would suffer automatic excommunication (future conclave {{participants were required}} {{to swear an oath}} not to transmit a veto by a secular monarch to the conclave), and declined to reappoint Rampolla as Secretary of State. Like his predecessors, Pope Pius X disputed the Kingdom of Italy's right to own Rome. Following the precedents established by his two immediate predecessors for the granting of the urbi et orbi blessing since the 1870 invasion of Rome, Pius X gave his first Urbi et Orbi on a balcony facing into St. Peter's Basilica rather than to the crowds outside, so as to symbolise his opposition to Italian rule of Rome and his demand for a return of the States of the Church.|$|E
25|$|The post-war period saw a huge {{building}} boom in Palermo. Allied bombing in World War II had left more than 14,000 people homeless, and migrants were pouring {{in from the}} countryside, {{so there was a}} huge demand for new homes. Much of this construction was subsidized by public money. In 1956, two Mafia-connected officials, Vito Ciancimino and Salvatore Lima, took control of Palermo's Office of Public Works. Between 1959 and 1963, about 80 percent of building permits were given to just five people, none of whom represented major construction firms and were probably Mafia frontmen. Construction companies unconnected with the Mafia were forced to pay protection money. Many buildings were illegally constructed before the city's planning was finalized. Mafiosi scared off anyone <b>who</b> <b>dared</b> to question the illegal building. The result of this unregulated building was the demolition of many historic buildings and the erection of apartment blocks, many of which were not up to standard.|$|E
