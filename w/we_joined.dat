25|$|More says he {{accepted}} {{the lead in the}} low budget youth film, Some People (1962), because he had no other offers at the time. The movie was profitable. He was one of many stars in The Longest Day (1962) and played the lead in a comedy <b>We</b> <b>Joined</b> the Navy (1962), which was poorly received.|$|E
500|$|In 1962 he {{appeared}} in Wendy Toye's comedy film <b>We</b> <b>Joined</b> the Navy before teaming up again with Peter Sellers in Only Two Can Play, Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure [...] "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—Waltz of the Toreadors—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy The Wrong Arm of the Law. Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that [...] "I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year {{he appeared}} in a third Sellers film, The Pink Panther, as a defence lawyer, {{and in the second}} Tony Hancock vehicle, The Punch and Judy Man. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role [...] "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.|$|E

2500|$|... "Toward evening a {{party of}} hangmen arrived. The {{officers}} went in and informed the condemned men {{they were to be}} executed between four and five in the morning. Their reply was to sing [...] "Hatikvah" [...] and other songs in powerful voices. They then shouted to us that the hangings would begin at four o'clock, in this order: Avshalom Haviv, Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss. They added: 'Avenge our blood! Avenge our blood!' We shouted back, 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes. At four in the morning Avshalom began singing [...] "Hatikva," [...] and <b>we</b> <b>joined</b> in loudly, pressing against the bars. At once armed police came up to the visitors' fence near our cell. At 4:03 Avshalom was hanged. At 4:25 we were shaken by the powerful singing of Meir. Hardly able to breathe, we nevertheless joined in. He was hanged at 4:28. At five o'clock the voice of Yaakov, this time alone, penetrated our cell, singing [...] "Hatikva." [...] Again <b>we</b> <b>joined</b> in. Two minutes later he was hanged.... At dawn we informed the prison officers through an Arab warder that we would not be responsible for the life of any Englishman who dared enter the jail yard. We declared a fast and prayed. Later in the morning we found the following inscription {{on the wall of the}} cell of the condemned: 'They will not frighten the Hebrew youth in the Homeland with their hangings. Thousands will follow in our footsteps.' Next to it was the Irgun insignia and their three names in the order they were executed." ...|$|E

On February 13, 2008, {{it was reported}} that several Russian Tu-95 bombers were intercepted over the Pacific by F/A-18s from Nimitz while on a surge deployment in the region. One Tu-95 was escorted and flew directly over the carrier at 2000 feet, escorted by VFA-41 Hornets. The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Gary Roughead called the incident [...] "benign" [...] and said: [...] "they came out to look. <b>We</b> <b>joined</b> up (and) flew with them until they went home". A total of four Russian bombers were involved; two remained about 500 miles east of the carrier strike group, and another orbited about 50 miles away as one Tu-95 did two low passes over the Nimitz carrier group.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, {{described}} by the Daily Post as a [...] "popular young leader" [...] on the Opposition benches, he strongly criticised {{what he saw as}} the Kilman government's lack of [...] "fiscal responsibility", with a lack of funding for decentralisation or for students' scholarships, while ministers and MPs still had their foreign travels funded. During a speech in Parliament criticising budget priorities, he mentioned Kilman's [...] "directive to the Public Service not to buy any new cars, and then they went and bought 25 million vatu worth of new vehicles. So who is the boss of the Public Service? Are you - the Prime Minister - not the boss?" [...] Highlighting the country's trade deficit, he added: “We see less exports and more imports. Since <b>we</b> <b>joined</b> the WTO, less exports and more imports. Local businesses are breaking down. We spend hundreds of millions of vatu in trade, but {{what do we do with}} it? We talk about more development needed in the productive sector, but kill it off". He nonetheless noted the budget safeguards on spending on education and health, and voted in favour of the budget so as not to block necessary spending on public services.|$|E
