5|$|The co-main event {{featured}} a bout between two top contenders and undefeated light heavyweights, Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva. The two were originally {{scheduled to meet}} at UFC 89, but a back injury forced Silva {{to withdraw from the}} contest. UFC President Dana White indicated in the pre-fight press conference that Machida would receive a title shot with a victory, while Silva would need to defeat Machida and win one more contest before earning the same opportunity. Machida is a fighter <b>who</b> <b>prefers</b> to counter-strike, and combines Shotokan Karate, sumo wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to form his own style. Silva is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, but prefers to fight standing. Machida entered the UFC 94 fight following a unanimous decision victory over former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz at UFC 84, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards. Thiago Silva entered the contest with 1st round TKOs over Antonio Mendes at UFC 84, and Houston Alexander at UFC 78.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge <b>who</b> <b>prefers</b> him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning at the breakfast table, Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E

[...] Humboldt State University, Psychology, 2009 This study {{explored}} Extraversion personality {{differences among}} people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> dogs, people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> cats, people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> both, and people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> neither. Participants were 120 {{students from the}} Psychology Department Participation Pool at Humboldt State University. Personality was evaluated using the NEO-PI-R Extraversion Scale. Also, participants were given a list of personality trait adjectives and asked to assign them to either people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> dogs or people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> cats. Results showed significant differences in Extraversion among the pet preference groups. People <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> dogs scored higher than people <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> cats on the overall domain of Extraversion and the facets Excitement-Seeking and Gregariousness. People <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> dogs also scored higher than people <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> both on Extraversion and the facets Warmth, Excitement-Seeking, and Gregariousness. Results also showed {{that there are certain}} personality traits that people tend to assign to those <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> dogs vs. those <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> cats. The top personality traits chosen for people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> dogs were Sociable, Friendly, Excitement-Seeking and High-Spirited. The top personality traits chosen for people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> cats were Quiet, Shy, and Independent. All of the traits predominantly chosen for people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> dogs were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring higher in Extraversion. All of the traits predominantly chosen for people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> cats were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring lower in Extraversion...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} visual {{preference and}} value for fresh beef steaks differing in marbling level and color, consumers in Chicago and San Francisco (n = 124 per city) evaluated {{two pairs of}} steaks in a retail case. Steaks differing in marbling level (Modest/Moderate vs. Slight) and color (bright, cherry-red vs. dark red) were purchased at retail stores in each city. Consumers selected their preferred steak in each pair, described their selection criteria, and provided the price {{they were willing to}} pay {{for each of the four}} steaks. There was a difference in visual preference in each city, with most consumers preferring (P < 0. 01) low (Slight) over high (Moderate/Modest) marbling; however, more (P < 0. 01) consumers in Chicago (86. 7 %) preferred low marbling than in San Francisco (67. 0 %). Selection criteria were categorized into five groups: marbling, fat, color, appearance, and palatability. Marbling was mentioned by 65. 4 % of consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> high marbling, whereas 64. 9 % of consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> low marbling mentioned fat as a selection criterion. Bright, cherry-red color was preferred by a higher (P < 0. 01) percentage of consumers in both Chicago and San Francisco (67. 6 and 76. 5 %, respectively). Color was mentioned both by consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color (64. 8 %) and those <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> dark red color (63. 9 %). All preference groups were willing to pay more for their preferred steak (P < 0. 01), but consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> low marbling were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their preferred steak than consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> high marbling. Consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their preferred steak than consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> dark red color. Consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> low marbling seemed to desire lean products, and consumers <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> high marbling seemed to desire products with high eating quality. In this study, consumers were willing to pay more to purchase their preferred product; however, most consumers preferred low marbling and bright, cherry-red color...|$|R
5|$|Subspecies (1991) follows three college students, Mara, Michelle, and Lillian, as {{they begin}} a study on Romanian culture and superstition {{in the small town}} Prejmer. They are befriended by Stefan, a student {{studying}} nocturnal animals. It is revealed that the nearby Castle Vladislas has been caught in a power struggle between vampire brothers Stefan and Radu. Centuries prior, King Vladislas was seduced and cursed by a sorceress who eventually gave birth to Radu. After banishing Radu's mother, the king met a mortal woman. She gave birth to Stefan, <b>who</b> <b>prefers</b> to live in the open, and loathes his vampire heritage. To gain control over the Bloodstone, a relic that is said to drip the blood of the saints, Radu kills his father. In an effort to hurt his brother, Radu turns Mara and Lillian into vampires. Stefan, having fallen in love with Michelle, helps her try and free Mara and Lillian from Radu's control. Stefan drives a stake through Radu's heart and severs his head with a sword, killing Radu. Unfortunately for Stefan, Radu bites Michelle before his brother can kill him and mingled his blood with hers, which forces Stefan to turn Michelle with his own blood in order to keep her from becoming like Radu. As Stefan and Michelle sleep, Radu's minions set about resurrecting their master.|$|E

Most young Chinese Singaporeans speak either English or Mandarin while the elderly, though able to converse in Mandarin, have preferred other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka, or Hainanese. As the south-eastern Chinese varieties are not taught in school, the number of their speakers has steadily declined. In addition, many parents have begun to communicate with their children solely in English, believing that the language is essential to attain upward social mobility. Many of the young Chinese in Singapore are unable to use their mother tongues fluently.
