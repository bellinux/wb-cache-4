5|$|In 1835, Victoria became {{seriously ill}} of typhoid fever {{on the last}} of the royal tours.

Even after Victoria's eighteenth birthday on 24 May 1837, Conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge her need for a regent until she turned twenty-one.|$|E
