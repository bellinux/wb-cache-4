50|$|Contamination {{may affect}} a person, a place, an animal, or an object such as clothing. Following an {{atmospheric}} nuclear weapon discharge or {{a nuclear reactor}} containment breach, the air, soil, people, plants, and animals in the vicinity will become contaminated by nuclear fuel and fission products. A spilled vial of radioactive material like uranyl nitrate may contaminate the floor and any rags used to <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the <b>spill.</b> Cases of widespread radioactive contamination include the Bikini Atoll, the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the Chernobyl disaster, and {{the area around the}} Mayak facility in Russia.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} a paper towel is often judged based on how quickly it can <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> a <b>spill.</b> However, the test methods {{currently}} available cannot repeatably measure significant differences in absorbent rate between samples. Recent round-robin testing evaluations by TAPPI and CEN organizations have shown that past methods, such as ASTM D 5802 - 95 and TAPPI T 561 -pm [1], are unreliable due to high variability. The reasons {{for the lack of}} repeatability are unclear. The relation between the wicking mechanism and the fundamental absorbent properties needs to be better understood. This paper uses x-ray imaging to show the overall flow characteristics of fluid absorption within a towel, and compares the results to model predictions to show which parameters are important to the process. From this understanding, a revised test method is proposed that provides adequate statistical discernment of absorbent rate properties of tissue on a simple lab-bench scale device...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to keep laminate clean, as dust, dirt, and sand particles may scratch the surface over time in high-traffic areas.

Water spills aren't a problem if they're <b>wiped</b> <b>up</b> quickly, and not allowed to sit for a prolonged period of time.|$|R
