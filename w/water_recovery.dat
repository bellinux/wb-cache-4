25|$|On {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} International Space Station, Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough {{successfully}} conducted the mission's second spacewalk. The EVA was 6 hours and 45 minutes in duration, and all tasks were accomplished without complications. Two crew equipment carts were relocated {{in preparation for the}} arrival of the final set of solar arrays, the station's robotic arm was lubricated, and the work on the starboard SARJ continued. Inside the station, crewmembers continued to transfer cargo from Leonardo to the station, items to be returned to Earth into the MPLM, and continued the activation of the <b>Water</b> <b>Recovery</b> System.|$|E
25|$|The two crews {{continued}} transfer operations, and Finke and Pettit {{worked together}} to reconfigure the Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) to try to dampen any vibration that may be contributing to the unit's shutting down prematurely. The unit has continued to operate sporadically, shutting itself down after {{two to three hours}} of operations, and the engineers on the ground are still evaluating the possible causes and solutions. Managers on the ground would make a decision Monday on whether to extend Endeavours mission by one docked day, to help with the troubleshooting of the <b>Water</b> <b>Recovery</b> System (WRS). The Endeavour crew had several hours of off-duty time, and participated in media interviews.|$|E
50|$|Water heat {{recycling}} (also {{known as}} drain <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery,</b> waste <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery,</b> greywater heat recovery, or sometimes shower <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery)</b> {{is the use}} of a heat exchanger to recover energy and reuse heat from drain water from various activities such as dish-washing, clothes washing and especially showers.

25|$|Electrodeionization: Water {{is passed}} between a {{positive}} electrode and a negative electrode. Ion exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible {{if the right}} conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove non-ionic organic contaminants, and with gas transfer membranes to remove carbon dioxide. A <b>water</b> <b>recovery</b> of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.|$|E
25|$|Floating debris was {{collected}} {{in the early morning}} hours after the accident. Two days after the accident, officials had established a one mile exclusion zone against fishing activities near the accident site, and the AAIB had requested specialized deep <b>water</b> <b>recovery</b> equipment to recover the wreckage and, they hoped, the bodies of the pilot and paramedic. Six days later the diving support vessel Seaway Osprey arrived on the scene of the accident with remotely operated vehicles (ROV's) and saturation divers capable of manually recovering debris. Within twelve hours all major components of the aircraft had been recovered except for the left wingtip, which was discovered on May 2, 2005, in a trawler's fishing net about 2.5nm from the debris field. The wreckage was brought to the AAIB's hangar at RAF Machrihanish (on which Campbeltown Airport was located at the time of the accident) for analysis.|$|E
25|$|Flight day six {{was devoted}} to {{transfer}} operations, and the two crews worked through the morning to complete all the rack transfers. Magnus and Chamitoff successfully installed the two crew quarters racks into the Harmony node, and installed a rack with equipment {{to be returned to}} Earth into the MPLM. During the Mission Status briefing, Lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that all the racks were now on station, and about 25% of the cargo transfers had been completed, which was slightly ahead of schedule. The two crews also began working on activating the <b>Water</b> <b>Recovery</b> System, so that samples of water from two areas could be taken and returned to Earth with Endeavour. The system's initial checkout was initiated, and water samples would be taken after several days of operation. Later in the day, the two crews reviewed procedures for the mission's second EVA, and Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough would sleep in the station's airlock as part of the pre-EVA campout procedure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study and explain the purpose and the {{function}} of drain water heat exchangers. The thesis goes over theory behind heat transfer and heat exchangers and presents the general solutions of domestic drain <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery</b> systems. Systems gone over in detail are the different general shower drain <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery</b> systems. Another part of the thesis is {{a case study of}} an actual shower drain <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery</b> system of a Finnish household. The purpose of the case study is to study the actual temperature increase of cold water in a drain <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery</b> unit and efficiency of such heat exchanger. An alternate goal is to study the difference in efficiency values and temperature gains between two heat exchangers of the same model, where the other has been used significantly more than the other. In other words, another target is to study the fouling effect. The calculations are done using real measurement data. The most important findings are that utilizing a shower drain heat recovery unit provides real energy savings in the long run, {{and that there is a}} significant difference of efficiency between a dirty and a clean heat exchanger. Drain <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery</b> systems provided as high as 15 °C increase in the temperature of cold water. A clean heat exchanger boasts an impressive 50. 4 % efficiency, whereas the dirtier heat exchanger provides a 36. 1 % efficiency. The results can be further used to calculate the energy savings of the household on a yearly basis. Furthermore, the results show that domestic drain <b>water</b> heat <b>recovery</b> could potentially make a significant difference in national energy usage if implemented nationwide...|$|R

2500|$|The most drastic of the {{modifications}} was {{the removal}} of the external keel. Hartley Pratt, a draughtsman working in another department at Vickers, calculated that this would be disastrous, but his warnings were ignored. Pratt subsequently left the company, but was re-hired to lead the design of the next British airship, the No. 9r which was ordered from Vickers in 1913. [...] Other changes included deleting the forward elevators and the <b>water</b> <b>recovery</b> apparatus. [...] The positions of the gondolas was also reversed, the heavier forward gondola being moved to the aft position. [...] The changes resulted in the Mayfly having a disposable lift of 3.21 tons.|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, we report a {{multichannel}} ceramic tubular membrane for <b>water</b> and heat <b>recovery</b> from gas streams. Mass and heat transfer {{performances of the}} multichannel tubular membrane are systematically investigated and {{compared with those of}} a monochannel tubular membrane. Compared with the monochannel tubular membrane, the multichannel membrane has much larger mass and heat transfer resistances, leading to lower mass and heat transfer rates. Operational parameters (e. g., fluid velocities and transmembrane pressure difference) have insignificant effects on mass and heat transfer in the multichannel membrane, suggesting that transfer resistance from the membrane itself rather than the boundary layers dominates mass and heat transfer in membrane condensation. The multichannel membrane shows larger volumetric mass and heat transfer coefficients, comparable <b>water</b> <b>recoveries,</b> but lower heat recoveries compared with the monochannel tubular membrane. <b>Water</b> and heat <b>recoveries</b> exhibit a proportional correlation using the multichannel tubular membrane, indicating that heat transport is governed by convective heat transfer, and thermal conductive heat transfer is negligible in the multichannel membrane. 8 page(s...|$|R
