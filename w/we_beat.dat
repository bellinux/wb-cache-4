[...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool captain Yeats {{collected}} the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II in the Royal box at Wembley Stadium. The victory was the club's {{first in the}} competition. Liverpool manager Shankly was delighted with the result and hailed the achievement: [...] "To think a team like Liverpool had never won the FA up was unbelievable, so many had prayed {{for it to happen}} over all the years, but it had never come to pass. So when <b>we</b> <b>beat</b> Leeds, the emotion was unforgettable." [...] Despite breaking his collarbone in the opening minutes, Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne completed the whole match. Shankly was full of praise for the defender stating: [...] "Byrne was absolutely fantastic. He played the best game of his life." [...] Bryne was concerned about collecting his medal, stating: [...] "I was worried about going up to collect my medal, so many of our fans wanted to slap me on the back.

500|$|Newcastle United's {{aspirations}} {{of winning the}} league suffered {{as a result of}} the match.

The defeat left Manchester United six points ahead with five matches remaining. After witnessing Newcastle beat Leeds United on 30 April 1996, Keegan, in a televised outburst, accused Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson of trying to provoke the Leeds players, adding that he [...] "will love it if <b>we</b> <b>beat</b> them" [...] to the championship. Ferguson, who accused Leeds of [...] "cheating" [...] their manager in their performance at Old Trafford two weeks earlier, was perceived by the press as playing a mind game against his opposition. Newcastle finished second in the league that season, five points behind Manchester United, which prompted Keegan to offer his resignation, which was rejected, in the summer. In January 1997, Keegan quit as manager, and said that he felt he had [...] "taken the club as far as I can".|$|E
500|$|The Rainmen went on {{to qualify}} for the 2015 Finals against the Windsor Express.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor Ike Armstrong, Curtice focused his attention on offense and continually tinkered with his split-T offense. His teams are {{perhaps best known for}} popularizing the Utah Pass, which is an overhand forward shovel pass of the ball. The play is commonly used today by teams which use a spread offense. Quarterback Lee Grosscup caught the attention of the east coast press when he and the Utes had a close 33–39 loss to top ten program Army at West Point, New York.
