40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the design, modeling, and optimization of an electromagnetic energy harvesting (EMEH) device with various tube length and <b>winding</b> <b>coil</b> width. The nonlinear magnetic-spring configuration is employed for gen-erating sufficient power from hand shaking of irregular and low-frequency vibrations. Based on the modeling and simulation, longer tube {{length of the}} EMEH device results in lower resonant frequency and stronger nonlinearity {{of the system and}} thus is more efficient for low-frequency harvesting. From the hand shaking test, it is found that a longer tube length and a shorter <b>winding</b> <b>coil</b> width could induce a higher power generation. The optimized device of tube length of 66 mm and <b>winding</b> <b>coil</b> width of 10 mm has achieved maximum power outputs of 568. 66 µW at the hand shaking acceleration of 1 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz, which corresponds to the power density of 90. 67 µW/cm 3. Further improvement of the device has been achieved by increasing the coil length to 40 m. This device provides maximum power outputs of 825. 36 µW at the hand shaking acceleration of 1. 56 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz. This paper demonstrates a feasible design of nonlinear EMEH device with impressive output performance from hand shaking.

40|$|The {{technically}} {{pure copper}} is {{being replaced by}} aluminium as conductive material in electrical transformers for power systems. This evolution brings new manufacturing challenges. One major difficulty is the limited weld ability and non-acceptable residual deformations of the aluminium, when welded by fusion arc welding processes. The Friction Stir Welding (FSW) was selected for evaluation considering the requisites of the application on mechanical strength, distortion and electrical conductivity. The current work evaluates the feasibility of application of FSW to join successive residual aluminium foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils,</b> into new longer foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils.</b> The residual foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> are made of AA 1070 with 1. 6 mm thick and 1100 mm wide. The residual foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> are butt jointed by FSW and rewind in one new longer foil winding until the total length of the new bobbin already enables its application {{in the production of}} new components for high voltage electrical transformers. This way, the FSW may be used as key technique to add-value and promote a more sustainable industrial production system. Each of the residual foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> had an average weight of about 250 kg, which required the development of dedicated supporting, positioning and clamping systems. The technological conditions to be implemented in real scale are initially developed in 300 mm length welds. The analysis of the results addresses the mechanical resistance, hardness distribution and metallurgical properties of the resulting joint zones. It was demonstrated the technological feasibility of joining by FSW, and rewind, residual winding foils, to produce new coils complying with the requirements for distortion, mechanical strength and electrical resistance properties.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. In switched-flux permanent-magnet machines, <b>winding</b> <b>coil</b> {{connections}} can be rearranged into {{several types of}} machine winding configurations (MWCs), such as all poles wound, alternate poles wound, and single and dual three-phase windings. This paper investigates the influence of machine saliency on a sensorless control operation based on different MWCs. First, by injecting an HF carrier signal, the machine saliency level can be evaluated experimentally. The influence of saliency on an HF-signal-injection-based sensorless operation for different MWCs can be then investigated irrespective of any information of machine parameters. However, the secondary saliency caused by magnetic saturation or current harmonics may exist in a machine, due to which the sensorless control performance will deteriorate. Hence, an orthogonal signal-based position tracking observer is proposed to improve the accuracy of rotor position estimation rather than utilizing an existing position observer. Furthermore, experimental results confirm that a prototype machine exhibits different saliency characteristics and apparent saliency, in which the HF-injection-based sensorless control technique can be applied. Moreover, better steady and dynamic state performance {{can be achieved by}} the improved position estimator compared with using an existing position observer...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{optimized}} five-level inverter topology is proposed for a four pole induction motor drive. This topology has developed {{by using the}} advantage of two identical voltage profile <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> per phase in a four pole induction motor. The identical voltage profile <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> are disconnected and {{each part of the}} winding is fed with two two-level inverters from both sides. Thereby four two-level inverters are used to generate five voltage levels on induction motor phase windings. All two-level inverters are fed with single DC link with the magnitude V dc over 4 (where V dc is the dc-bus voltage required for a conventional NPC five-level inverter). Because of the common DC link for all the two-level inverters, common mode currents will find a path through the motor phase windings {{due to the lack of}} isolated neutral. To minimize the common mode currents a Sine-Triangle Pulse Width Modulation is used in the proposed topology. Thereby the first dominant harmonics and triplen harmonics shifted near to the switching frequency, which will have a less impact on the motor phase currents. Since the dominant harmonics are less in the proposed topology, it gives almost sinusoidal output voltage which will improve the efficiency of the drive system. The proposed topology does not require any major design modifications of induction motor. The proposed topology is simulated in MATLAB (Simulink) with (5 HP) four pole induction motor with sine triangle PW...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEddy Current (EC) Technique is a {{powerful}} method for detection of surface notches and of buried flaws during inspection of metallic parts. This technique is used for inspection at different industrial domains like aeronautics and nuclear one. Classical winding coils are {{the most commonly used}} EC sensors. Nevertheless, when the size of flaws decreases or the defect is rather buried deep inside the material, traditional <b>winding</b> <b>coil</b> probes turn out to reach their limits. For this reason, other technologies are investigated to improve this technique. Magnetoresistive sensors present the advantages of flat frequency response and dimensions at the micron size. These sensors are hence very attractive for the detection of buried defects that require low frequencies because of skin depth effect. Also, they are suitable for small surface defects due to high spatial resolution because of their manufacturing down to one hundred µm without losing their field sensitivity. An optimization of such probes based on magnetoresistive sensors (GMR - giant magnetoresistive and MTJ – magnetic tunnel juntions) specially designed to be integrated into an eddy current probe has been experimentally studied. Measurements using MR array probes consisting of 32 GMR- and MTJ-elements, an ASIC, subsequent readout components, and emitters for EC generating inside the material under test are shown.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a five-level {{inverter}} topology is presented for a four pole induction motor drive {{with a single}} DC source. In any ac motor, the <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> which are 3600 (electrical) apart will have identical voltage profiles. A conventional four pole induction machine consists of two such Identical Voltage Profile <b>Winding</b> <b>Coils</b> (IVPWCs) which are connected in series (or parallel). In the proposed method the series (or parallel) connected IVPWCs are disconnected into two parts. Each IVPWC is fed by a two two-level inverters from both the sides thereby four two-level inverters are used to generate the five-level voltage across the motor phase winding. All these four two-level inverters {{are connected to the}} same DC source with a magnitude v/dc (where Vdc is the dc bus voltage required for conventional five-level NPC inverter). Pulses for this five-level inverter configuration is generated using Unipolar phase shifted carrier PWM (UPSC PWM) technique by providing appropriate phase shift between modulating waves and carrier waves independently. Using the advantage of both IVPWCs of the induction motor stator winding and UPSC PWM the harmonics can be shifted to higher order which is close to four times compared to the harmonics with general SPWM. This circuit configuration does not require any major design modifications of the induction motor except the disconnection between the IVPWCs. The five-level inverter configuration supplying a Shp four pole induction motor drive is tested with unipolar phase shifted carrier PWM in MATLAB(Simulink).

Secondary coil, a set of two equal and oppositely <b>winded</b> <b>coils,</b> is first <b>winded</b> over the hylum former. Then the primary <b>coil</b> is <b>winded</b> over it. Copper wire (150 micron) is used for winding. The whole set up is then set in the cryocooler (HC- 4 E, Sumltomo cryogenics). An ac current is supplied to the primary coil from DSP Lock-in Amplifier (Model SR 830), which produces the required magnetic field. This magnetic field magnetize the sample and an induced emf in secondary coil is observed. The effect of magnetic field in secondary coil is cancelled by the two oppositely <b>winded</b> <b>coil</b> system. So that the emf induced is only due to the change in moment of sample. This emf is then separated to in-phase and out-of phase voltage component in lock-in amplifier. The in-phase and out-of phase voltage component is converted to in-phase and out-of phase component of ac susceptibility by dividing a voltage factor V 0. Temperature is lowered down to liquid helium temperature in cryocooler and data are recorded using lab view program. Then the in-phase and out-of phase component of ac susceptibility is plotted against varying temperature. This is the background plot for ac susceptometer.

The voltage can be smoothly varied between turns as the brush has a relatively high resistance (compared with a metal contact) and the actual output voltage is a function of the relative area of brush in contact with adjacent windings. The relatively high resistance of the brush also prevents it from acting as a short circuited turn when it contacts two adjacent turns. Typically the primary connection connects to only a part of the winding allowing the output voltage to be varied smoothly from zero to above the input voltage and thus allowing the device to be used for testing electrical equipment at the limits of its specified voltage range.|$|R
