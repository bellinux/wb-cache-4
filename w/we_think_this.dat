Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it does sound just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is going to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E

Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, [...] "This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it {{goes hand in hand with}} genocide.

2500|$|In the UK, {{questions}} were raised over whether T had any valid insurance in place. Those insurance companies {{which could be}} connected to T, such as Royal & Sun Alliance, alleged that their policies excluded liability for asbestos-related claims, although this was in breach of the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. Insurers stated that instead they had an [...] "understanding" [...] that T itself would settle asbestos claims and, [...] "in return for premiums received, the insurers would, however, issue a Certificate of Insurance which complied with {{the terms of the}} Employers' Liability Act, thereby enabling T to continue trading." [...] By 2003, no payments had been received by UK claimants and a request to the government to set up an interim compensation scheme was rejected, as was a request to the US Creditors' Committee of Federal-Mogul to make hardship payments to UK victims. As further litigation ensued to test the validity of the insurers' exclusions, public demonstrations were held outside the Manchester offices of Kroll Corporate Advisory & Restructuring Group, the court-appointed Administrators for T Tony Whitston, spokesperson for North-West Asbestos Victims’ Support Groups, said: [...] "Kroll have charged £17 million in fees to date and their solicitors have charged £6 million. The charge out rate for a senior partner at Kroll is £460 per hour. The financial “killing” being made by the Administrators is reducing the resources [...] left to pay dying victims. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> behaviour {{is a classic example of}} corporate greed and callousness." ...|$|E

"If you mean, my dear Sir John, {{that which}} {{property}} is most apt to teach, we hold {{it to be}} selfishness; but if you mean that he who has money, as a rule, will also have in formation to guide him aright, I must answer, that experience, which is worth a thousand theories, tells us differently. We find that on questions which are purely between those who have, {{and those who have}} not, the HAVES are commonly united, and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> would be the fact if they were as unschooled as bears; but on all other questions, they certainly do great discredit to education, unless you admit that there are in every case TWO rights; for, with us, the most highly educated generally take the two extremes of every argument.

[...] "The benefits of despotism are short-lived; it poisons the very springs which it lays open; if it display a merit, it is an exceptional one; if a virtue, it is created of circumstances; and when once this better hour has passed away, all the vices of its nature break forth with redoubled violence, and weigh down society in every direction."

60|$|It {{was this}} {{doubling}} on the French line, by anchoring inside, and putting two ships upon one, that gave Nelson so high {{a reputation as}} a tactician. The merit of this man[oe]uvre belongs exclusively to one of his captains. As the fleet went in, without any order, keeping as much to windward as the shoals would permit, Nelson ordered the Vanguard hove-to, to take a pilot out of a fisherman. This enabled Foley, Hood, and one or two more to pass that fast ship. It was at this critical moment that the thought occurred to Foley (<b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> was the officer) to pass the head of the French line, keep dead away, and anchor inside. Others followed, completely placing their enemies between two fires. Sir Samuel Hood anchored his ship (the Zealous) on the inner bow of the most weatherly French ship, where he poured his fire into, virtually; an unresisting enemy. Notwithstanding the great skill manifested by the English in their mode of attack, this was the only two-decked ship in the English fleet that was able to make sail on the following morning.|$|E

6000|$|In his defence of the Cuvierian doctrine, Professor Owen avails {{himself of}} the odium theologicum. He {{attributes}} to his opponents [...] "the insinuation and masked advocacy of the doctrine subversive of {{a recognition of the}} Higher Mind." [...] Now, saying nothing about the questionable propriety of thus prejudging an issue in science, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is an unfortunate accusation. What is there in the hypothesis of necessary, as distinguished from actual, correlation of parts, which is particularly in harmony with Theism? Maintenance of the necessity, whether of sequences or of coexistences, is commonly thought rather a derogation from divine power than otherwise. Cuvier says--"None of these parts can be changed without affecting the others; and consequently, each taken separately, indicates and gives all the rest." [...] That is to say, in the nature of things the correlation could not have been otherwise. On the other hand, Professor Huxley says we have no warrant for asserting that the correlation could not have been otherwise; but have not a little reason for thinking that the same physiological ends might have been differently achieved. The one doctrine limits the possibilities of creation; the other denies the implied limit. Which, then, is most open to the charge of covert Atheism? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{point of}} the Vindication is simple enough.

If, after all, you should confess all these things, yet plead the necessity of political institutions, weak and wicked as they are, I can argue with equal, perhaps superior force, concerning the necessity of artificial religion; and every step you advance in your argument, you add a strength to mine. So that if we are resolved to submit our reason and our liberty to civil usurpation, we have nothing to do but to conform as quietly as we can to the vulgar notions which are connected with this, and take up the theology of the vulgar as well as their politics.

But our misery is much greater than theirs, as the crime we commit in rejecting the lawful dominion of our reason is greater than any which they can commit.
