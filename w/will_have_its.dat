5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by the pet trade, and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a pet it often <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner. This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, the pet trade is inflated by replacements. With a greater purchasing power, the increasing human populations in the species' range could have an even more serious impact.|$|E

25|$|LDL receptors {{are used}} up during {{cholesterol}} absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by SREBP, the same protein {{that controls the}} synthesis of cholesterol de novo, according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Retention factor (kappa prime) {{measures}} {{how long}} {{a component of the}} mixture stuck to the column, measured by the area under the curve of its peak in a chromatogram (since HPLC chromatograms are a function of time).

25|$|An {{advantage}} of this method {{is that it is}} fast (5–20 minutes per sample); a disadvantage is that the solute's chemical structure must be known beforehand. Moreover, since the value of log P is determined by linear regression, several compounds with similar structures must have known log P values, and extrapolation from one chemical class to another—applying a regression equation derived from one chemical class to a second one—may not be reliable, since each chemical classes <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> characteristic regression parameters.|$|E
