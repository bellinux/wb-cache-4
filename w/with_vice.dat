5|$|After {{having been}} {{temporarily}} incapacitated by several severe health problems, President Dwight D. Eisenhower attempted to clarify procedures through a signed agreement <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> President Richard Nixon, drafted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr.. However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon never made any effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E
5|$|By July 1803, {{citizens}} of the western states, desiring more representation {{in the federal government}} and intent on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and New Yorkers for most important federal offices, were advocating Breckinridge's nomination as vice president in the 1804 presidential election. Thomas Jefferson was expected to be reelected, but most Democratic-Republicans had grown disenchanted <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> President Aaron Burr; he would not be Jefferson's running mate. Breckinridge's service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice.|$|E

5|$|Karmal was {{appointed}} Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous <b>with</b> <b>vice</b> head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting {{voted in favor}} of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.|$|E
5|$|William was a month shy of {{his seventh}} {{birthday}} in 1804 {{when his father}} was infamously killed in a duel <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> President Aaron Burr. In 1814, he was admitted to the United States Military Academy, resigning three years later in 1817. Following his resignation from West Point, Hamilton migrated to Sangamon County, Illinois. He lived in Springfield and Peoria, Illinois until 1827 when he moved to the lead mining region around the Fever River.|$|E
5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E

5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet {{did not intend to}} reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur did not {{get along}} with Carpender, and twice asked {{for him to be}} {{replaced}}, only to be embarrassed in November 1943 when King replaced Carpender <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid without informing MacArthur or seeking the approval of the Australian government. However, a face-saving formula was agreed upon. For the invasion of Leyte, the Seventh Fleet was massively reinforced by ships from the Pacific Fleet. Cover was provided by Admiral William F. Halsey's Third Fleet, which remained under Nimitz. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the divided command brought the Allies to the brink of disaster when misunderstandings arose between Kinkaid and Halsey. Allied Naval Forces was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy {{convened a}} {{commission}} to investigate the explosion {{the day after the}} incident <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> Admiral Murakami Kakuichi as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the cordite in her magazine might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. Kawachis magazines had been inspected in January–February 1918, however, and no problems were discovered, which made that possibility less likely. The commission made recommendations on tighter control of production and handling of cordite that were successfully adopted by the navy. The Japanese Navy considered salvaging Kawachi, but ultimately decided that it would be too expensive and would delay the construction of one battlecruiser by over a year. Stricken from the navy list on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E

5|$|On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield {{were walking}} through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by an assassin, Charles J. Guiteau. Guiteau, a {{deranged}} man who had earlier pestered Blaine and other State Department officials to be appointed to ambassadorships {{for which he was}} grossly unqualified, believed that by assassinating the President he could ingratiate himself <b>with</b> <b>Vice</b> President Arthur and receive his coveted position. Guiteau was captured immediately and hanged just short of a year later; he survived longer than Garfield, who lingered for two-and-a-half months, then died on September 19, 1881. Garfield’s death was not just a personal tragedy for Blaine; it also meant the end of his dominance of the cabinet and the end of his foreign policy initiatives. With Arthur’s ascent to the presidency, the Stalwart faction now held sway and Blaine’s days at the State Department were numbered. Arthur asked all of the cabinet members to postpone their resignations until Congress recessed that December; Blaine nonetheless tendered his resignation on October 19, 1881 but agreed to remain in office until December 19, when his successor was in place. Blaine’s replacement was Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Stalwart. Arthur and Frelinghuysen undid much of Blaine’s work, cancelling the call for a Pan-American conference and stopping the effort to end the War of the Pacific, but they did continue the drive for tariff reductions, signing a reciprocity treaty with Mexico in 1882.|$|E
