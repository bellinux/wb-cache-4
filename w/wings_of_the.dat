He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dove.|$|E

5|$|The university's first {{classes were}} held in at Burnside Place, James McGill's country home. Burnside Place {{remained}} the sole educational facility until the 1840s, when the school began construction on its first buildings: the central and east <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arts Building. The rest of the campus was essentially a cow pasture, a situation similar to the few other Canadian universities and early American colleges of the age.|$|E
5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance {{takeoffs}} required by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After wind tunnel and engine tests, but before the N–20 could make its maiden flight, Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, neither of the aircraft came into production, although the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P-16 were later used {{in the development of}} the successful Learjet.|$|E
5|$|Due to pancreatitis, Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 {{games for the}} Red Wings in 1966–67. His numbers were down as he won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. The Red Wings missed the playoffs. After another bout of pancreatitis {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining the Red Wings, Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E

To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{the court}} {{moved into the}} new Oregon Supreme Court Building, and McNary filed to run for a full six-year term on the bench. At that time the office was partisan, and McNary lost the Republican primary, by a single vote, to Henry L. Benson, after several recounts and the {{discovery}} of uncounted ballots. After his defeat, he served {{the remainder of his}} partial term and left the court in 1915. On July 8, 1916, after a close, multiballot contest, with several contenders, the Republican State Committee elected McNary to be the chair. He was seen as someone who could unify the progressive and conservative <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E
