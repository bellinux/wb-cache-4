5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are <b>woven</b> <b>flat,</b> using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting <b>weave</b> completely <b>flat.</b> Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|R

40|$|A common {{method to}} {{fabricate}} net-shaped three-dimensional (3 D) woven preforms for composite T-joints is to <b>weave</b> <b>flat</b> 3 D preforms via a standard weaving machine with variation in binder yarn path and then separate the preform {{in the form}} of a bifurcation. Folding introduces fiber architecture deformation at the 3 D woven bifurcation area. In this paper, a geometric modeling approach is proposed to represent the realistic fiber architecture, as a preprocessor for finite element analyses to predict composite structural performance. Supported by X-ray micro-computed tomography (mCT), three important deformation mechanisms are observed including yarn stack shifting, cross-section bending, and cross-section flattening resulting from the folding process. Furthermore, a set of mathematical formulae for simulation of the deformations in the junction region are developed and satisfactory agreement is observed when compared with mCT scan results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Perfect {{colouring}} of isonemal fabrics by thin striping of {{warp and weft}} {{with more}} than two colours is examined. Examples of thin striping in all possible species with no redundancy and with re-dundant cells arranged as twills are given. Colouring <b>woven</b> <b>flat</b> tori is discussed. 1. Background This paper takes {{up the subject of}} colouring fabrics perfectly with more than two colours introduced in [12] and extends it to thin striping, that is, to colouring the strands in both directions with a finite number of colours cyclically. The first three sections of [12] and the standard references [1, 4] are relevant and will not be repeated here. The next three paragraphs will give some idea of terms and notations to be used. A fabric is a two-fold weave that does not fall apart having warps (vertical and dark in colour) crossing wefts (horizontal and pale) in square cells, in each of which one strand (warp or weft) is uppermost or visible i...|$|R

50|$|Halters may be {{classified}} into two broad categories, {{depending on whether}} the material used is flat or round. Materials include cured leather, rawhide, rope, and many different fibers, including nylon, polyester, cotton, and jute. Leather and rawhide may be flat or rolled. Fibers may be <b>woven</b> into <b>flat</b> webbing or twisted into round rope. Flat or round dictates the construction method: flat materials normally are sewn to buckles or rings at attachment points; round materials are knotted or spliced. Knotted halters often are made from a single piece of rope.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The major {{barrier to}} {{accelerating}} {{the transition from}} 2 D fabric lamination to integral 3 D textile preforms is the high costs. Toward this end, sub-stantial researches have been conducted. This paper reports on a conventional approach to the forming of 3 D <b>flat</b> <b>woven</b> preforms in a shuttle-weaving machine. The factors in determining woven pattern design and weaving process are discussed. Twelve 3 D woven samples with various fiber architectures are produced to test the feasibility of the forming techniques. The design and manufacturing method is validated by comparing the fiber volume fraction of samples between design values and testing ones. Modification details of the weaving machine are described. Some key issues, such as warp yarn arrangement and selvedge pattern design are also discussed. It is demonstrated that conventional weaving machines with minimum modifications can be employed as a potentially cost-effective mean to successfully manufacture 3 D <b>flat</b> <b>woven</b> preforms.
