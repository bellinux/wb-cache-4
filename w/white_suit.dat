5|$|Celebrities, artists, {{and merchants}} enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, {{such as a}} disco ball {{specially}} imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a <b>white</b> <b>suit</b> and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E

The two people in <b>white</b> <b>suits</b> are then seen holding ropes about Brian Welch's neck with long posts while he sings. One of the women is seen on an exam table with an oxygen mask over her mouth, while the other woman is seated on a chair with her hands tied behind it with rope and her legs constrained together. Welch is then dragged while lying on the ground. The woman continues struggling to free herself, causing the chair to fall on its side and her being able to stand up, disabling the security camera and removing the mask from the other woman who was having convulsions. The video screen broadcasting {{the contents of the}} security camera then explodes, impacting the two people in <b>white</b> <b>suits.</b> The women, dressed in gowns, then run from the facility hand in hand, escaping their almost deadly fate.|$|R

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a <b>white</b> <b>suit</b> as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a <b>white</b> <b>suit,</b> he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E
25|$|While Twain {{is often}} {{depicted}} wearing a <b>white</b> <b>suit,</b> modern representations {{suggesting that he}} wore them throughout his life are unfounded. Evidence suggests that Twain began wearing white suits on the lecture circuit, {{after the death of}} his wife Olivia ("Livy") in 1904. However, there is also evidence showing him wearing a <b>white</b> <b>suit</b> before 1904. In 1882, he sent a photograph of himself in a <b>white</b> <b>suit</b> to 18-year-old Edward W. Bok, later publisher of the Ladies Home Journal, with a handwritten dated note on verso. It did eventually become his trademark, as illustrated in anecdotes about this eccentricity (such as the time he wore a white summer suit to a Congressional hearing during the winter). McMasters' The Mark Twain Encyclopedia states that Twain did not wear a <b>white</b> <b>suit</b> in his last three years, except at one banquet speech.|$|E
