30|$|From the {{analysis}} above, the water resistance of compregs {{was attributed to}} the densification of the <b>wood.</b> The <b>parenchyma</b> tissues and vessels of wood were densified during the compression process. The PF resin penetrated into the cell lumen and a rigid cross-linking network was formed between resin and the cell wall during curing, which made the wood structure maintained in denser shaper. Moreover, the swelling of the cell wall due to the penetration of resin into cell wall helps to increase dimensional stability [15, 32]. The mutually penetrated and interlocked structures of dense, thin-walled cells and phenol resin blocked the impregnation path of water [33]. Therefore, the hygroscopicity of comgres was reduced.|$|R

40|$|Stem {{structure}} strongly {{influences the}} drought response across {{a diverse group}} of temperate and tropical tree species. The stem of Salvadora persica (miswak), used as a chewing stick in the Islamic world, has a number of distinctive xeromorphic characteristics adapting it to arid or semi-arid conditions. The thick periderm is interrupted at points around the stem by transversely oriented lenticels to moderate exchange of vital gases. On the stem surface are 3 -dimensional epicuticular crystals of various shape and size, present to protect against UV exposure, insects and pathogens. The secondary xylem contains groups of xylem fibers which consist of thick-walled narrow cells. Vessels are axially oriented without branching for interconnection. The xylem is also com-posed of parenchyma cells, which are characterized as ray parenchyma and <b>wood</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> The wood-parenchyma become crushed in the middle, forming a chamber which is later filled with amorphous inclusions or rhombohedral crystals. SEM-EDX analysis revealed sulphur in <b>wood</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, likely a defense against pathogenic microorganisms.

30|$|Figure  3 also showed, {{although}} the mechanical properties were over all well retained, they decreased slightly sometimes. This is {{probably due to}} the uneven distributed compression ratio and MC. In one hand, during the compression, the compression force was transported from outside to the center of wood, while the strength of latewood, early <b>wood</b> and <b>parenchyma</b> was not the same, the strength of the vessel and the fiber are not the same, consequently, the compression ratio in some place is probably much bigger than the other, resulting in partial damage. In the other hand, during the compression, the reduced and possibly uneven distributed MC would lead wood partially not-enough hygroplastisized, resulting in partial damage as well. Here, it is worth mentioning that, during the compression, the bond between wood constituents (hemicelluloses attached to the cellulose fibrils bonds {{with the rest of the}} lignin-rich matrix) and the bond between wood and water were replaced by each other repeatedly, in this dynamic courses, the effect of MC on the mechanical properties (unlike in the steady condition, MC over equilibrium moisture content (EMC) has no effect on the mechanical properties), need to be studied systematically.|$|R
30|$|In {{the middle}} part of {{earlywood}} in the tenth annual ring from the cambium (middle {{part of the}} intermediate wood), elliptical nuclei were observed in the ray parenchyma cells (a white arrow in Fig.  5 c). Some vacuoles were obviously deformed and contained almost no protein (a white arrowhead in Fig.  5 c). These deformed vacuoles had an irregular profile. By contrast, vacuoles that contained proteins were not deformed and had a smooth profile (a black arrowhead {{on the left side}} in Fig.  5 c). In the middle part of the earlywood of the eleventh annual ring from the cambium (inner part of the intermediate <b>wood),</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells had elliptical nuclei (a white arrow in Fig.  5 d). The number of deformed vacuoles in each of the ray parenchyma cells tended to be greater than in the tenth annual ring from the cambium (white arrowheads in Fig.  5 e). In addition, there were more ray parenchyma cells with deformed vacuoles than in the tenth annual ring from the cambium. Moreover, some large vacuoles had been observed but they had contained almost no protein (a black arrow in Fig.  5 d). In some ray parenchyma cells, we observed both deformed vacuoles and large vacuoles (a black arrow and white arrowheads in Fig.  5 d, e).|$|R

40|$|The cell {{walls in}} plants {{are made up}} of just four basic {{building}} blocks: cellulose (the main structural fibre of the plant kingdom) hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. Although the microstructure of plant cell walls varies in different types of plants, broadly speaking, cellulose fibres reinforce a matrix of hemicellulose and either pectin or lignin. The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb-like cells of wood to the closed-cell, liquid-filled foam-like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young's modulus varies from 0. 3 MPa in parenchyma to 30 GPa in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0. 3 MPa in parenchyma to over 300 MPa in dense palm. The moduli and compressive strength of plant materials span this entire range. This study reviews the composition and microstructure of the cell wall as well as the cellular structure in three plant materials (<b>wood,</b> <b>parenchyma</b> and arborescent palm stems) to explain the wide range in mechanical properties in plants as well as their remarkable mechanical efficiency.

40|$|Coniferous {{trees are}} rich in {{chemical}} compounds such as terpenes, fats/fatty acids, waxes, tannins and phenolics, which function to protect the tree against insect pests and diseases, and as energy reserves. Compounds extractable with organic solvents typically comprise about 3 to 5 percent of total biomass on a whole tree dry basis, and may represent up to 25 percent in certain tree parts, such as heartwood in the inner basal portion of the stem and roots. Trees may develop higher levels or altered profiles of extractives when subjected to stressors, including mechanical injury, water-deficit, pest attack, or atmospheric pollutants. Terpenes are {{a large group of}} compounds having molecular formulas that are multiples of C 5 H 8. Oleoresin is an important natural product that is a mixture of resins (diterpene acids) that are normally a solid material at room temperature, and volatile essential oils (mono- and sesqui-terpenes) that serve as a solvent to maintain the oleoresin in a fluid state. Oleoresin is synthesized by the thin-walled epithelial cells within the <b>wood</b> <b>parenchyma</b> tissue. In pines and firs, these structures are organized as a network of interconnected radial and longitudinal ducts which store oleoresin at elevated pressure and transport it to injury sites. Oleoresin is especially abundant in certain pines, such as Pinus elliottii, P. palustris, P. taeda, and P. ponderosa. Pine oleoresin is commercially produced from about 20 pine species in both natural an...|$|E

30|$|Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) is {{a native}} species of Japan and {{extensively}} used as a plantation forestry species. The wood from this species is utilized by the wood industry to produce construction lumber. The mobility of radiocesium emitted by the global fallout from atmospheric nuclear bomb testing or the Atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki has been previously investigated in the stem wood of Japanese cedar [1 – 6]. Recently, {{it was reported that}} the radiocesium emitted by the accident in 2011 may be translocated to the stem wood of Japanese cedar via the foliar surface [7], bark surface [8], and root uptake [9]. Similar results have been obtained on the radioactive contamination of stem wood of other forest tree species [10 – 13]. Furthermore, Aoki et al. [14] suggested that stable cesium (133 Cs) was radially transported from the bark to stem <b>wood</b> via ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells in 3 -year-old Japanese cedar seedlings. It is important, therefore, to clarify the within-tree distribution of 137 Cs in Japanese cedar from the initial period of contamination. In addition, the movement of 137 Cs in the stem wood should be determined to predict the future level of contamination of Japanese plantation forests and wood resources from the plantations.|$|R
40|$|Wood {{density is}} {{considered}} a key plant trait, affectingmechanical and physiological performance, yet its biological meaning is still rather unclear. Accordingly we investigated the anatomical underpinnings of wood density in trees and shrubs. We measured wood density and anatomical traits in distal stems 4 - 10 mm diameter under bark in 24 Australian species. Proportions of wood components that are functionally distinct were analysed, including fibre wall and lumen, vessel wall and lumen, and axial and ray <b>parenchyma.</b> <b>Wood</b> density was mainly driven by the density of wood outside vessel lumens (densityNV) rather than by vessel lumen fraction. In turn, densityNV variation was chiefly affected by fibre wall and lumen fractions. Considerable anatomical variation was observed at a given densityNV, especially among medium-densityNV species (0. 60 - 0. 85 g cm⁻³); this range of medium densityNV roughly translates to 0. 50 - 0. 75 g cm⁻³ of overall density. The anatomy of these species formed a continuum from low fibre lumen and medium parenchyma fractions to medium fibre lumen and low parenchyma fractions. Our data suggest that wood density is an emergent property influenced by a complex anatomy rather than an unambiguous functional trait, particularly in medium-density species. Withmuch anatomical variation, they likely represent {{a wide range of}} ecological strategies. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Plant R 2 R 3 -MYB {{transcription}} factors play {{an important}} role in plant secondary cell wall formation, by activating or repressing their target genes in a coordinated manner within a complex regulatory network. They belong to a large gene family - 180 genes in poplar -, with some members already identified as master switches in the regulation network (Zhang et al, 2014). Here, we combined genetic engineering and chromatin immuno-precipitation technique (ChIP-SEQ) in order to elucidate the function of 2 R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factors in poplar, MYB 090 and MYB 156. MYB 090 potentially regulates a high number of target genes in planta through a highly conserved motif, similar to GAMYB. These target genes are involved in the biosynthetic pathways of lignin, cellulose and xylans, which are the major components of secondary cell walls. Overexpression of MYB 090 in poplar reduced stem growth and its total lignin content; lignification was severely impacted in <b>wood</b> <b>parenchyma</b> rays. By contrast, overexpression of MYB 156 in poplar showed no growth defect, at least for some transgenic lines, while the total lignin content was decreased of 15 % in the stem. These plants contained hypolignified fibers while the lignification of vessels seemed unaffected. These different results led to the conclusion that both MYB factors are transcriptional repressors of lignification, but act at different levels of the regulatory network. This work opens new avenues on the building of transcriptional regulatory networks involved in secondary cell wall formation. It also generated new poplar transgenic lines with interesting traits for bioethanol production.

40|$|Nowadays, wood {{industry}} in Indonesia suffers {{from lack of}} wooden raw material because of the demand {{is greater than the}} supply. In order to solve this problem, we need to enhance the use of wood by optimalizing the use of wooden raw material wich has a great potensial, but not well used, for example hybride coconut wood. The purpose of this research were to determine physical, mechanical and chemical properties of hybride coconut wood and its vertically and horizontally variation in order to optimalize the use of hybride coconut wood. This research used three hybride coconut steems, the 6 cm disks were extracted from each stem at 1, 4, 7, and 10 m heights. The analyze of vascular bundle and parenchyma consisted of covered area per cm 2 and their chemical composition. Hybride coconut wood had a low specific gravity because vascular bundle covered area was lower than parenchyma per cm 2 and low wood substance portion. Low specific gravity caused low mechanical properties. Hight moisture content (specially fresh one) was cause by sugar and starch extractives which had high hygroscopic ability. These extractives content also caused it to be easily attacked by <b>wood</b> destroying factors. <b>Parenchyma</b> covered area per cm 2 caused high sugar and starch content.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the occurrence and distribution pattern of non-lignified parenchyma in species of Cactaceae and Portulacaceae, of which samples of roots and stems of six species of Cactaceae and four species of Portulacaceae were analysed. The first records of non-lignified parenchyma in Portulacaceae were obtained and, {{in the case}} of Cactaceae, an in-depth discussion is given on the characterization of this tissue by various authors, as well as new information on the occurrence and distribution pattern of the non-lignified parenchyma. The terminology used to characterize the non-lignified parenchyma cells in the wood of Cactaceae is extremely diversified and often not very descriptive, which makes it difficult to establish homologies and better characterize this tissue. Non-lignified parenchyma cells in the secondary xylem in Cactaceae and Portulacaceae occur in association with the fibrous phase of the wood, often forming true continuous bands. This resembles what some authors call <b>parenchyma</b> <b>wood.</b> The proposal {{of this study is to}} demonstrate that, independent of the distribution pattern of the non-lignified parenchyma cells, the terminology used should follow that of the International Association of Wood Anatomists (IAWA) Committee as non-lignified parenchyma and not refer to a parenchymous phase of the wood.

40|$|Araucarioxylon Kraus is {{a widely}} known fossil-genus {{generally}} applied to woods {{similar to that of}} the extant Araucariaceae. However, since 1905, several researchers have pointed out that this name is an illegitimate junior nomenclatural synonym. At least four generic names are in current use for fossil wood of this type: Agathoxylon Hartig, Araucarioxylon, Dadoxylon Endl. and Dammaroxylon J. Schultze-Motel. This problem of inconsistent nomenclatural application is compounded by the fact that woods of this type represent a wide range of plants including basal pteridosperms, cordaitaleans, glossopterids, primitive conifers, and araucarian conifers, with a fossil record that extends from the Devonian to Holocene. Conservation of Araucarioxylon has been repeatedly suggested but never officially proposed. Since general use is a strong argument for conservation, a poll was conducted amongst fossil wood anatomists in order to canvass current and preferred usage. It was found that the community is divided, with about one-fifth recommending retention of the well-known Araucarioxylon, whereas the majority of others advocated use of the legitimate Agathoxylon. The arguments of the various colleagues who answered the poll are synthesized and discussed. There is clearly little support for conservation of Araucarioxylon. A secondary aspect of the poll tackled the issue as to whether Araucaria-like fossil woods should be either gathered into a unique fossil-genus, or whether two fossil-genera should be recognized, based on the respective presence or absence of axial parenchyma. A majority of colleagues favoured having one fossil-genus only. Agathoxylon can be used legitimately and appears to be the most appropriate name for such woods. However, its original diagnosis must be expanded if those <b>woods</b> lacking axial <b>parenchyma</b> are to be included...|$|R
