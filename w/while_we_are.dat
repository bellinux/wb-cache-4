25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> still looking at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E

500|$|... "4 Minutes" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Madonna from her eleventh studio album Hard Candy (2008), featuring vocals by American singers Justin Timberlake and Timbaland. It was released as the lead single from the album on March 17, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. According to Madonna, the song is about saving the environment and [...] "having a good time <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing it". She also cited the song as {{the inspiration for the}} documentary I Am Because We Are (2008).|$|E
500|$|I don't think it's {{important}} to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much {{more aware of the}} environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know {{at the same time we}} don't want to be boring and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet can we have a good time <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing it? ...|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} argued in recent years, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CPC {{does not have an}} ideology, and that the party {{organization}} is pragmatic and interested only in what works. This view is considered wrong by some in many ways, since official statements make it very clear the party does have a coherent worldview. For instance, Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is [...] "threatening to divide us" [...] and that [...] "the international culture of the West is strong <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets". The CPC puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and into crafting its ideological message. Before the [...] "Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth" [...] campaign, the relationship between ideology and decision-making was a deductive one, meaning that policy-making was derived from ideological knowledge. Under Deng this relationship was turned upside down, with decision-making justifying ideology and not the other way around. Lastly, Chinese policy-makers believe {{that one of the reasons}} for the dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology. They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party's rule, unlike the Soviet Union's communist party, whose ideology they believe became [...] "rigid, unimaginative, ossified, and disconnected from reality." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{screening}} for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo {{took place on}} November 28, 2011, {{as part of a}} critics-only event hosted by the New York Film Critics Circle. Commentators at the event predicted that while the film would become a contender for several accolades, it would likely not become a forerunner in the pursuit for Academy Award nominations. A promotional campaign commenced thereafter, including a Lisbeth Salander-inspired collection, designed by Trish Summerville for H. The worldwide premiere was at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on December 12, 2011, followed by the American opening at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 14 and Stockholm the next day. Sony's target demographics were men and women over the age of 25 and 17–34. The film went into general release in North America on December 21, at 2,700 theaters, expanding to 2,974 theaters on its second day. The United Kingdom release was on December 26, Russia on January 1, 2012, and Japan on February 13. India and Vietnam releases were abandoned due to censorship concerns. A press statement from the Central Board of Film Certification stated: [...] "Sony Pictures will not be releasing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in India. The censor board has judged the film unsuitable for public viewing in its unaltered form and, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> committed to maintaining and protecting the vision of the director, we will, as always, respect the guidelines set by the board." [...] In contrast, the National Film Board of Vietnam insisted that the film's withdrawal had no relation to rigid censorship guidelines, as it had not been reviewed by the committee.|$|E

2500|$|In this work, one of {{his most}} {{emphatic}} statements on faith, he argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin. All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just. On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: [...] "Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> here, for this life is not a place where justice resides." ...|$|E
2500|$|Compared with nonhuman primates, {{humans have}} {{significantly}} enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations {{to be extended}} and inhalations shortened as we speak. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate. The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates. Evidence from fossil hominins suggests that the necessary enlargement of the verterbral canal, and therefore spinal cord dimensions, may not have occurred in Australopithecus or Homo erectus [...] but was present in the Neanderthals and early modern humans.|$|E

Yellowcard's official Facebook page announced on August 1, 2010, that the band had reformed and would be {{working on a new}} record. Regarding the direction of the new album, Key said on the Hopeless Records website on August 2, [...] "We’re talking about a ton of different ideas, and we’re itching to start as soon as possible. Ultimately, we want to make something the fans will love. What we love to do most is look out from the stage and see people exploding with energy, and I think we keep that in mind <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> writing.
