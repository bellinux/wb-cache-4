5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E
25|$|During the {{development}} of the first anime, Arakawa allowed the anime staff to work independently from her, and requested a different ending from that of the manga. She said that she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> repeat the same ending in both media, and wanted to make the manga longer so she could develop the characters. When watching the ending of the anime, she was amazed about how different the homunculi creatures were from the manga and enjoyed how the staff speculated about the origins of the villains. Because Arakawa helped the Bones staff in the making of the series, she was kept from focusing on the manga's cover illustrations and had little time to make them.|$|E

In 1962, Ellington did not have a recording contract, while Mingus was signed to United Artists.

2500|$|.....the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall boldly uphold {{economy in}} detail; {{and it is}} the mark ... of ... a chicken-hearted Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he shrinks from {{upholding}} economy in detail, when, because {{it is a question of}} only £2,000 or £3,000, he says that is no matter.

No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who is not ready to save what are meant by candle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of his country.

2500|$|The Australian Anti-Bases Campaign Coalition (AABCC) {{was formed}} {{on the basis}} of {{lobbying}} and protests that developed over the years from the 1960s when the majority of U.S. bases in Australia were established. It was founded by the New South Wales branch of the PND (People For Nuclear Disarmament). In 1974, several hundred people travelled to North West Cape from around Australia to protest and occupy the base. Anti-Americanism supposedly exists among school teachers in Australia, which has been condemned by conservative politicians. In August 2005, Treasurer Peter Costello condemned anti-American sentiment by teachers and criticised the teaching of history in Australian schools. According to an article published by The Monthly magazine, Australians muttered stories about George W. Bush over glasses of beer and despaired of neoconservatism in coffee shops, lamenting the so-called Ugly American activities. According to the same article, Rupert Murdoch, an American who had renounced his Australian citizenship over two decades prior, said during a November 2006 visit to Australia that [...] "he was worried about a [...] "regrettable" [...] anti-American sentiment in Australia." [...] In a poll taken by U.S. magazine Reader's Digest with 1000 Australians, 15 percent of Australians described themselves as [...] "anti-American".

2500|$|In December 2015, Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{revealed}} {{plans for}} Daniel's [...] "good-natured" [...] personality {{to change as}} {{he turned away from}} his hippy ideals. Daniel changed his look and became more career-driven. Of the changes to Daniel's personality, Phillipps explained: [...] "I think it's an important change that had to happen for Daniel's development. He's always been a positive person, and I don't think that goes away in this storyline. But Daniel has been under Paul's guidance for a long time now. It's made him start to understand some really important life messages about how sometimes you've got to take more risks, be more ruthless and push a little harder. It's all part of Daniel's evolution as a character." [...] Phillipps told Kilkelly that he spoke to the writers about giving Daniel [...] "more status" [...] within the community and believed that making him more career-driven would be a good way for him to gain respect from other characters. The actor also believed that viewers would find Daniel more interesting, but added that his positive attitude would still be there. Daniel began working at Lassiter's Hotel, following his brief stint in real estate sales. He already knew the hotel business from working alongside Paul. Daniel's new attitude and career change was marked by a new haircut. Phillipps had chosen to shave his hair off, so the writers incorporated his new style into the storyline. Phillipps added that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see Daniel become a copy of his uncle, but he did want Daniel to be [...] "strong-willed and street smart" [...] like him.|$|E
