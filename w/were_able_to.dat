5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E

5|$|A tag team {{match for}} the Unified Tag Team Championship followed, between the champions The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith), who were {{accompanied}} by their manager Natalya, and the team of Chris Jericho and The Miz. The Hart Dynasty took the early advantage, but Jericho and The Miz <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> isolate both Smith and Kidd in the ring {{at different points in}} the match, wearing them down. Natalya interfered by tripping up Jericho while The Miz had the referee distracted. The Hart Dynasty <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> capitalise, and performed the Hart Attack on The Miz for the pinfall victory.|$|E
50|$|As {{children}} refine their motor skills, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{help themselves}} by completing daily activities independently. For example, {{children between the}} ages of 2 and 3 <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing. They <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dress and undress themselves without assistance. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. And by age 6, a child <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cut softer foods with a knife and <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tie his or her own shoes. Because all children develop at their own rate, the ages given are not an exact timeline.|$|R

50|$|Research {{has also}} {{examined}} whether non-human primates <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> conserve. Chimpanzees <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make judgements on whether two quantities of liquid {{are the same}} or different, and they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> conserve correctly when liquids are transformed based on inferences. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> correctly conserve for solid quantities, but they <b>are</b> not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> complete conservation of number tasks. Orangutans <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> differentiate between same and different quantities of liquid but they <b>are</b> only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pseudoconserve, similar to children in {{the second stage of}} conservation development, and ultimately fail to correctly complete conservation of liquid tasks (see Age of conservation ability).|$|R

5|$|According to {{management}} researcher John J. Clancey, scientific management can involve {{the use of}} throffers. While piecework had been utilised since the Middle Ages, Frederick Winslow Taylor blended rationalised management with piecework, {{to create a new}} system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements {{from the}} colonial headquarters at Batavia, the Dutch launched an attack in 1635 and <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> crush opposition {{and bring the}} area around present-day Tainan fully under their control. After seeing Mattau and Soulang, the most powerful villages in the area, defeated so comprehensively, many other villages in the surrounding area came to the Dutch to seek peace and surrender sovereignty. Thus the Dutch <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dramatically expand {{the extent of their}} territorial control in a short time, and avoid the need for further fighting. The campaign ended in February 1636, when representatives from twenty-eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement Dutch sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|Aided by air strikes, U.S. Army units <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> inflict {{substantial}} {{damage on}} the North Korean armor and other vehicles, but were overwhelmed by North Korean infantry.

5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still fairly common.

5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E

5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult.

Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
