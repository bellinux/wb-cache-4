5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> {{from which she}} frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a riskier slip knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} rectangular and circular tuned liquid dampers, which control wind-induced vibration in tall buildings, according to the natural frequency. The tuned liquid dampers (TLD) were of frequencies: 0. 44 Hz, 0. 55 Hz, 0. 64 Hz and 0. 73 Hz. The tuning feature of TLD <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> was better in circular <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> than in rectangular <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> Excitation amplitude affected the damping ratio based on energy dissipation capacity. At low excitation (below 5 mm) and low natural frequency (0. 44 Hz), circular <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> were advantageous over rectangular <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> However, at high excitation (over 5 mm) and high natural frequency (over 0. 55 Hz), rectangular <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> were advantageous over circular <b>water</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} {{underwater}} scene, {{most of which}} was shot at the <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> at Universal, Lawless had to be seat-belted into a car {{that was supposed to}} be submerged thirteen feet. In actuality, the <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> was four feet deep. Lawless, being six feet tall, had to kneel and breathe into a hookah while filming the scene. For the special effects team, one of the hardest parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit.|$|E
5|$|The Water Tower {{is located}} on the northwestern side of the island, near Tower No. 3, beyond the Morgue and Recreation Yard. The <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> is {{situated}} on six cross-braced steel legs submerged in concrete foundations.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{consumption of}} drinking water puts a heavy burden on our future water resources. Therefore the reuse of rain water in households {{can be a good}} option to tackle this problem. On the other hand the rapidly drained rain water leads to problems in the combined sewer systems and watercourses. If the storage in the rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> can be used to flatten the rain water runoff, rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> can have an additional benefit. The effect of rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> on the combined sewer overflow (CSO) emissions is therefore investigated with a reservoir model. Compared with storage in the combined sewer system or at the overflow, storage in rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> will be more efficient in reducing the overflow emissions. However much more storage in rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> must be provided to obtain the same overflow frequency as when downstream storage is used, because the storage in rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> is less frequently available. When all the economical, social and environmental aspects are considered, rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> can certainly be promoted as a good solution. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingénieur John Cutter testifies how Borden {{pushed the}} <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> under the trap door {{to catch and}} kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick.

As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.|$|E
5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and the ruins of the Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> complete with over one million gallons of water. The <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E

5|$|In September 2011, filming {{moved to}} the Ciudad de la Luz {{audiovisual}} complex in Alicante, Spain. Shooting areas included the complex's large <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> and a nearby beach. The complex was booked from August 22, 2011, through to December 10, 2011, and set construction occurred from August until late September. Approximately 250 people worked on the three-month-long Spain shoot, generating over €1 million in the local economy. Filming also {{took place in the}} Wadi Rum valley in Jordan.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to national aid, various countries {{and human rights}} related organizations provided varying forms of assistance. The United States provided $25,000 in cash plus an additional $40,000 to help school re-construction and $540,000 to help re-build destroyed homes. Norway donated almost $80,000. The United Nations Development Programme awarded $30,000. UNICEF granted $50,000 worth of medicine. The Catholic Relief Services donated $65,000, with the intended use for shelter, food, and medicine. CARE also contributed $12,300 in order to repair a <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> and schools.|$|E

It had two platforms and an adjacent hotel, {{as well as an}} engine shed and <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> The station was closed in 1902 as the land was required for the expansion of Avonmouth Docks, although it remained in use for workers' trains until 1903.

40|$|Using {{data from}} free listings and a survey in two villages of Tamil Nadu, India, we discuss local {{perceptions}} and uses of <b>water</b> <b>tanks,</b> a traditional irrigation infrastructure. We hypothesize that both farmers and nonfarmers perceive and use <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> for purposes other than irrigation. We found that informants {{recognized the importance}} of <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> for irrigation, but also acknowledged other socioeconomic uses and ecological functions. Marginal sectors (i. e., Scheduled Castes) use tank resources in more diverse ways than other sectors of the population. Findings are relevant for development. International organizations working on the revival of <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> aim to transfer water management to farmers for the purpose of irrigation. By recognizing that tanks benefit people other than farmers and in ways other than providing irrigation water, organizations working on tank rejuvenation could achieve a more equitable management of tank resources...|$|R
