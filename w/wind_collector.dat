The Czochralski method results in a bulk composition with slightly higher oxygen, for example. The CZ silicon array wafers that were Genesis-flown were purchased from MEMC Electronics.

40|$|NASA's Genesis Discovery Mission is {{designed}} to collect solar matter {{and return it to}} earth for analysis. The mission consists of launching a spacecraft that carries high purity collector materials, inserting the spacecraft into a halo orbit about the L 1 sun-earth libration point, exposing the collectors to the solar wind for two years, and then returning the collectors to earth. The collectors will then be made available for analysis by various methods to determine the elemental and isotopic abundance of the solar wind. In preparation for this mission, potential collector materials are being characterized to determine baseline impurity levels and to assess detection limits for various analysis techniques. As part of the effort, potential solar <b>wind</b> <b>collector</b> materials have been analyzed using resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS). RIMS is a particularly sensitivity variation of secondary neutral mass spectrometry that employs resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) to selectively postionize an element of interest, and thus discriminates between low levels of that element and the bulk material. The high sensitivity and selectivity of RIMS allow detection of very low concentrations while consuming only small amounts of sample. Thus, RIMS is well suited for detection of many heavy elements in the solar wind, since metals heavier than Fe are expected to range in concentrations from 1 ppm to 0. 2 ppt. In addition, RIMS will be able to determine concentration profiles as a function of depth for these implanted solar wind elements effectively separating them from terrestrial contaminants. RIMS analyses to determine Ti concentrations in Si and Ge samples have been measured. Results indicate that the detection limit for RIMS analysis of Ti is below 100 ppt for 10 {sup 6 } averages. Background analyses of the mass spectra indicate that detection limits for heavier elements will be similar. Furthermore, detection limits near 1 ppt are possible with higher repetition rate lasers where {{it will be possible to}} increase signal averaging to 10 {sup 8 } laser shots...|$|E
40|$|Total {{reflection}} X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) {{was used}} to analyze residual surface contamination on Genesis solar wind samples and to evaluate different cleaning methods. The Genesis mission collected solar wind {{during a period of}} 854 days by embedding the charged particles into collectors made of various ultra clean materials such as silicon, sapphire and silicon-on-sapphire. The sample return capsule unexpectedly crashed on return to Earth fracturing the collectors and exposing them to the desert soil of the landing side. The ubiquitous contaminants are separated from the atoms of solar wind by only 5 - 15 nm, presenting significant challenges for solar wind analysis as well as the development of cleaning techniques. Currently, an ultrapure water and ozone UV radiation treatment is routinely applied to the collectors by the curatorial team at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Additional cleaning steps involving various forms of acid treatment and/or carbon dioxide snow treatment are being evaluated as well. To gauge the suitability of the cleaning method, two samples were analyzed following cleaning by lab-based TXRF. The analysis comprised of an overview and a crude manual mapping of the samples by orienting them with respect to the incident X-ray beam in such way that different regions were covered. The results showed that cleaning with concentrated hydrochloric acid and a combination of hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid decreased persistent inorganic contaminants substantially on one sample. Application of carbon dioxide snow for surface cleaning tested on the other sample appears to be effective in removing one persistent Genesis contaminant, namely germanium. Unfortunately, the TXRF analysis results of the second sample were impacted by relatively high background contamination. This was mostly due to the relatively small sample size and that the solar <b>wind</b> <b>collector</b> was already mounted with silver glue for resonance ion mass spectrometry (RIMS) on an aluminum stub. Further studies are planned to eliminate this problem. In an effort to identify the location of very persistent contaminants, selected samples were also subjected to environmental scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationIn the past, {{the total}} installed wind power capacity {{was a small}} fraction of the power system and continuous connection of the wind farm to the grid was not a major concern. At the present time, wind power enjoys the status of the second fastest growing generation source for power grid application - second only to natural gas. The total wind power installation in the US stood at more than 21, 000 MW at the end of 2008, having doubled the wind power capacity in just two years. With this increasing share of electrical energy derived from wind power, connection of wind farms to the system has come under scrutiny particularly under system disturbances. Maintaining system stability and efficient fault ride through capability are the basic requirements for higher penetration. Wind turbines have to be able to continue uninterrupted operation under transient voltage conditions to be in accordance with the grid codes. Grid codes are certain standards set by regulating agencies. Wind power systems should meet these requirements for interconnection to the grid. Two of the major issues concerning a wind farm interconnection to a power grid are related to its contribution to frequency and voltage stability. Low voltage problems occur in a power system that is not able to meet the reactive power demand during heavy loading conditions and also during certain faults. Frequency problems occur when adequate regulating capacity is not available to withstand the variable nature of the wind resource. This paper investigates the possibility of enabling wind farms to provide both voltage and frequency support for the purpose of stabilizing the grid voltage and frequency after a load change or a grid disturbance. This enhanced operation requires the use of power electronic converters and specialized controllers that include pitch angle and rotor speed control. An inertia controller, a pitch angle controller and a rotor speed controller (RSC) are introduced for wind plant output active power adjustment for frequency control. A static synchronous compensator is used at the <b>wind</b> <b>collector</b> bus for voltage control. The controllers are tested in a 4 -bus test system for verification of the grid frequency and voltage performance under varying system dynamic conditions...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{elemental}} and isotopic composition of noble {{gases in the}} bulk solar wind collected by the NASA Genesis sample return mission. He, Ne, and Ar were analyzed in diamond-like carbon on a silicon substrate (DOS) and ^(84),^(86) Kr and ^(129),^(132) Xe in silicon targets by UV laser ablation noble gas mass spectrometry. Solar wind noble gases are quantitatively retained in DOS and with exception of He also in Si as shown by a stepwise heating experiment on a flown DOS target and analyses on other bulk solar <b>wind</b> <b>collector</b> materials. Solar wind data presented here are absolutely calibrated and the error of the standard gas composition is included in stated uncertainties. The isotopic composition of the light noble gases in the bulk solar wind is as follows: ^ 3 He/^ 4 He: (4. 64 ± 0. 09) × 10 ^(− 4), ^(20) Ne/^(22) Ne: 13. 78 ± 0. 03, ^(21) Ne/^(22) Ne: 0. 0329 ± 0. 0001, ^(36) Ar/^(38) Ar 5. 47 ± 0. 01. The elemental composition is:^ 4 He/^(20) Ne: 656 ± 5, and ^(20) Ne/^(36) Ar 42. 1 ± 0. 3. Genesis provided the first Kr and Xe data on the contemporary bulk solar wind. The preliminary isotope and elemental composition is: ^(86) Kr/^(84) Kr: 0. 302 ± 0. 003, ^(129) Xe/^(132) Xe: 1. 05 ± 0. 02, ^(36) Ar/^(84) Kr 2390 ± 150, and ^(84) Kr/^(132) Xe 9. 5 ± 1. 0. The ^ 3 He/^ 4 He and the ^ 4 He/^(20) Ne ratios in the Genesis DOS target are the highest solar wind values measured in exposed natural and artificial targets. The isotopic composition of the other noble gases and the Kr/Xe ratio obtained in this work agree with data from lunar samples containing “young” (~ 100 Ma) solar wind, indicating that solar wind composition has not changed within at least the last 100 Ma. Genesis could provide in many cases more precise data on solar wind composition than any previous experiment. Because of the controlled exposure conditions, Genesis data are also less prone to unrecognized systematic errors than, e. g., lunar sample analyses.
