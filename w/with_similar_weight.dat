Simultaneously, many mathematical models have been proposed to describe and predict the process of NF. Generally, the filtration mechanisms involve mainly steric hindrance (Bowen et al. 1997), Donnan exclusion (Schaep et al. 2001), and dielectric exclusion effects (Yaroshchuk 2001).

40|$|High-end {{carbon fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) ski poles of today are lighter and stiffer than previous generations, {{explained by the}} higher specific stiffness (stiffness to density ratio) for CFRPs {{in the range of}} 0. 1 - 0. 13 GPa m 3 /kg compared to approximately 0. 03 GPa m 3 /kg for aluminium.

We conclude that the strive for optimised weight and bending stiffness has generally driven the pole design to be sub-optimal towards stiffness making them unnecessarily sensitive to transverse and impact loads. Based on the experimental findings, we have developed numerical simulation models to predict the bending and stress state in CFRP ski poles under axial as well as transverse (impact) loading conditions.

The tactile or sensorial comfort is related to the mechanical interaction between the garment and the human body. Fabric Hand and Fabric Touch are two crucial elements that express how consumers experience textiles by touching them with the fingers and respectively by wearing them. Both subjective and objective methods are used to assess the fabric hand and touch. Within the ongoing CORNET project Touché both subjective methods (e. g. blind tests, questionnaires) and innovative instruments (e. g. FTT, TSA) are employed for assessment of fabric hand and touch. The Fabric Touch Tester (FTT) enables fast and simultaneous assessment of 13 physical fabric indices (e. g. bending, compression, friction, roughness and thermal conductivity) and uses these indices to predict comfort primary indexes such as smoothness, softness, warmness, total hand and total touch.

5000|$|A male’s call during {{non-breeding season}} {{is a series}} of loud notes with {{descending}} frequency which start in rapid succession and finish slowly. During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an emergent tree. Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the dawn chorus as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviors such as singing in order to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> <b>weights.</b> A side effect of this behavior might be the showcasing of a particular male’s ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.|$|R
