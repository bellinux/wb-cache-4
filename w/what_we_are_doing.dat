In 2001, the course measured [...] and was extended to [...] for 2002, and again in 2006 to [...] longer than the 2001 course. The changes attracted many critics, including the most successful players in Masters history, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Woods claimed that the [...] "shorter hitters are going to struggle." [...] Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson was unperturbed, stating, [...] "We are comfortable with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> with the golf course." [...] After a practice round, Gary Player defended the changes, saying, [...] "There {{have been a lot}} of criticisms, but I think unjustly so, now I've played it.... The guys are basically having to hit the same second shots that Jack Nicklaus had to hit (in his prime)".|$|E

On May 19, 2002, the series finale, [...] "The Truth", aired, and the Fox Broadcasting Company confirmed that The X-Files was not being renewed for a tenth season. When talking about {{the beginning of the}} ninth season, Chris Carter said, [...] "We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone away, and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> deserved to have them back." [...] "The Truth" [...] received the highest Nielsen household rating and viewership numbers of the season. It earned a 7.5 rating and gathered 13.25 million viewers in the United States. The loss of viewers resulted in this season seeing a 30 percent ratings drop when compared to the eighth season.|$|E

"I {{think the}} fall in bank lending would have <b>been</b> worse had <b>we</b> not {{conducted}} our asset purchases because <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> injecting money into the economy and what the banking system has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> destroying money.

Most of the money in our economy—broad money—comprises liabilities of banks in the form of bank deposits.

500|$|The {{original}} series finale, [...] "The Truth", attracted 13.25 million viewers, the series' lowest rated season finale. The ninth {{season was}} the 63rd most-watched {{show for the}} 2001–02 season, tying its season two rank. On May 19, 2002, the finale aired and the Fox network confirmed that The X-Files was over.

I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> deserved to have them back." [...] While news outlets cited declining ratings because of lackluster stories and poor writing, The X-Files production crew blamed September 11 terrorist attacks as the main factor. At the end of 2002, The X-Files had become the longest-running consecutive science fiction series ever on U.S. broadcast television. This record was later surpassed by Stargate SG-1 in 2007 and Smallville in 2011.|$|E

500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E
