500|$|Catherine {{was unable}} to control Henry in the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> Francis and Charles. Her role in his {{government}} became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took {{on the task of}} pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: [...] "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner." [...] She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, [...] "You are {{on the eve of a}} general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 July, Curieux {{arrived in}} Plymouth with dispatches from Lord Nelson. On her <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> spotted Admiral Villeneuve's Franco-Spanish {{squadron}} {{on its way}} back to Europe from the West Indies and alerted the Admiralty. Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, with 15 ships of the line, intercepted Villeneuve on 22 July, but the subsequent Battle of Cape Finisterre was indecisive, with the British capturing only two enemy ships.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her final}} film, Scared Stiff (1953, a {{black-and-white}} Paramount production with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), Miranda's appeal was again muted. Returning full-circle {{to her first}} Hollywood film, Down Argentine <b>Way,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> virtually no narrative function. Lewis parodies her, miming badly to [...] "Mamãe Eu Quero" [...] (which is playing on a scratched record) and eating a banana he plucks from his turban. Miranda played Carmelita Castilha, a Brazilian showgirl on a cruise ship, with her costumes and performances bordering on self-parody.|$|E

The girl's staunch all through, and the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> stuck to Winthrop in his trouble and the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> run the farm would compel the respect of any one who {{understood}} what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> had to put up with." ...|$|R

2500|$|That {{same day}} in Municipal Court, Harvey testified {{and gave the}} reason why Tondeleyo writhed the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> during the {{performance}} of December 19. [...] "In several of the scenes," [...] he explained, [...] "I grasped Tondeleyo's wrists so tightly that she writhed in pain attempting to escape me." [...] The Deputy City Attorney asked, [...] "And {{that is the reason}} for her wriggling?" [...] "It is," [...] Harvey replied, adding that he [...] "didn't actually hurt her." [...] The defendants all asserted that the command performance was identical with almost 600 previous performances.|$|E
2500|$|Dagmar was warmly welcomed in Kronstadt by Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich of Russia {{and escorted}} to St. Petersburg, {{where she was}} greeted by her future {{mother-in-law}} and sister-in-law on 24 September. On the 29th, she made her formal entry in to the Russian capital dressed in a Russian national costume in blue and gold and traveled with the Empress to the Winter Palace where she {{was introduced to the}} Russian public on a balcony. Catherine Radziwill described the occasion: ”rarely has a foreign princess been greeted with such enthusiasm… from the moment she set foot on Russian soil, succeeded in winning to herself all hearts. Her smile, the delightful <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> of bowing to the crowds…, laid immediately the foundation of …popularity” ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 January 1809 Melampus, under Captain Edward Hawker, {{captured}} Colibri off Barbuda, {{after her}} captain had the [...] "temerity" [...] {{to put up}} a fight as Melampus was sailing alongside. Colibri was armed with fourteen 24-pounder carronades and two 8-pounder guns, and had a crew of 92 men. In the engagement, Colibri had three men killed and 11 wounded before she struck. She was sailing from Cherbourg with a cargo of 570 barrels of flour and a great quantity of gunpowder intended for the relief of San Domingo. On her <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> captured and sunk two British brigs that had been sailing from Newfoundland to Lisbon, the Hannibal and the Priscilla, both of Dartmouth. The Royal Navy took Colibri into service under her existing name.|$|E

2500|$|Guðrún {{answered}} {{that she was}} innocent and could swear on the sacred white stone {{that she had not}} been with Þjóðrekr in that <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> only talked with Þjóðrekr about their sorrows in secret. Þjóðrekr had arrived with thirty warriors and he had lost all of them, while Atli, her husband, had murdered all her brothers and all the men of her people. Gunnarr could no longer come, and she could no longer greet Högni. She had lost both her beloved brothers and she would like to avenge Högni with her sword. She declared that she wanted payment for her sorrows and she suggested the ordeal of boiling water, for which Atli should summon Saxi, the king of the Southrons, who could hallow the kettle. Then, the poem passes to the execution of the ordeal and what happened to Herkja: ...|$|E
2500|$|The EU member governments – {{including}} Tony Blair’s – {{were not}} keen on extending the Parliament's powers, but on May Day the Amsterdam Treaty came into effect, which extended their influence somewhat. The Parliament {{had the opportunity}} to vote their approval of new EC head Romano Prodi, and did so 392 votes for to 72 against. However, Green's stock was damaged by the long controversy, with even her friends and supporters considering that her handling of the affair did not come across as a coherent strategy, although one commentator at the time did praise the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> [...] "ridden the Brussels storm with verve and conviction." [...] It was against this background – and allegations that she had improperly used her official car that Green dismissed as a [...] "cheap jibe" [...] that had been blown out of all proportion – that Green had to stand for re-election in her London constituency.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Waters {{appeared}} a satirical all-black film, Rufus Jones for President, which featured the child performer Sammy Davis Jr. as Rufus Jones. She {{went on to}} star at the Cotton Club, where, according to her autobiography, she [...] "sang 'Stormy Weather' {{from the depths of}} the private hell in which I was being crushed and suffocated." [...] In 1933, she had a featured role in the wildly successful Irving Berlin Broadway musical revue As Thousands Cheer, with Clifton Webb, Marilyn Miller, and Helen Broderick, in which she was {{the first black woman to}} integrate the Great White <b>Way.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> three gigs at this point; in addition to the show, she was a singer for Jack Denny & His Orchestra on a national radio program and continued to work in nightclubs. She was the highest-paid performer of any race on Broadway at that time. Reprising her stage role of 1940, she starred as Petunia in the successful 1942 film Cabin in the Sky, an all-black musical directed by Vincente Minnelli, for which MGM cast Lena Horne as the ingenue. In this same period, she became the first African American to star in her own television show in 1939, contrary to popular belief, decades before Nat King Cole appeared on the small screen in 1956. The Ethel Waters Show, a variety special, appeared on NBC on June 4, 1939; it included a dramatic performance of her self-produced Broadway play Mamba's Daughters, based in the Gullah community of South Carolina. The play was based on a book of the same name by DuBose Heyward.|$|E

2500|$|Interactive {{fiction writer}} Emily Short was {{generally}} {{pleased with the}} experimental gameplay of Heavy Rain, but found the game's story {{to be full of}} [...] "stock bits" [...] borrowed from films, leaving inconsistent characterisation and gaps and poor pacing in its plot. She cited the disconnection between the motivation of the specific character and the motivation of the game's player, such as when Ethan is challenged to navigate a maze of wires charged with electricity; Ethan the character is guided to finish it regardless of ability, but the player is given the option to abandon the challenge if they cannot do it. She also considered that the characterisation does not follow the game's claim of how choices matter, pointing out that the reveal of the identity of the Origami Killer was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> played the game to that point. Ian Bogost, a video game designer and Assistant Professor of Literature Communication and Culture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, counters claims that Heavy Rain qualifies as an [...] "interactive film". Bogost notes that [...] "film is editing", in that filmmakers put together images and scenes in a compilation to evoke certain feelings and emotions, and to convey story and plot in a limited amount of time. While Heavy Rain strives for this, it retains elements of a video game, and Bogost considers the game to have a [...] "rejection of editing in favor of prolonging"; examples given are the need to have the player provide interaction for most of the characters' motion, or having to control and watch Ethan throughout his search for Jason at the crowded mall. Bogost opined that this [...] "prolonging" [...] may actually be beneficial to the video game medium, as several scenes from the game's third chapter, during which Ethan runs through a routine schedule of homework, dinner, and bedtime for Shaun, allow for periods where the game waits for the player to interact with it; during these periods, simply by using mise en scène images of the house and characters, invite the player to think about what the characters are experiencing, [...] "to linger on the mundane instead of cutting to the consequential". In 2010, the game was included in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.|$|E
