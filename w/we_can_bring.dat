[...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to bring them home permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E

Humorous skits and sound effects were recorded {{in an attempt to}} create a psychedelic comedy album, foreshadowing much of his work on Smile, which was set to have followed Pet Sounds. The only product of these sessions present in Pet Sounds was an excerpt of Brian's dogs barking accompanied by a recording of passing trains, which was sampled from the 1963 sound effects LP Mister D's Machine. Brian may also have briefly considered recording other animal sounds for inclusion, as evidenced by a snippet of surviving studio chatter from a [...] "dog barking" [...] session. This features Brian asking studio engineer Chuck Britz: [...] "Hey, Chuck, is it possible <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> a horse in here without... if we don't screw everything up?", to which a clearly startled Britz responds, [...] "I beg your pardon?", with Brian then pleading, [...] "Honest to God, now, the horse is tame and everything!" ...|$|E

They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, but they said that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused.

2500|$|In the 1760s, {{a line of}} spiked chevaux de frise was {{constructed}} across {{the top and bottom}} ends of the Inundation. Ditches twelve feet wide and three feet deep were dug across the Inundation {{on both sides of the}} chevaux de frise so that if the lake ever dried out it would still serve as a barrier. Another barrier {{was constructed}} at the south end of the Inundation, and stakes were driven into the bed of the lake to serve as underwater obstacles. An unnamed correspondent for the London Chronicle wrote on 19 April 1762: [...] "thro' the middle [...] we have run chevaux de frize, lined with plates of iron, and studded with iron spikes, one row pointing towards Spain, and the other towards the garrison, to prevent desertion. They are five feet high, sunk in the mud, and the spikes above the water; by clasping your hands together, your fingers extended and the backs up, you will have an exact idea of them. Through this inundation an enemy must march to come near us, for the causeway is narrow, and when the tide is at lowest ebb, thirty men could not march a-breast upon the beach and causeway; upon which point <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> above 300 cannon and mortars to bear, besides wall-pieces and small arms."
