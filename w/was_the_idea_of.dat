5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays {{up all night}} sorting through {{documents}} in cartons <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, {{came up with the}} sub-plot involving the estate tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about the estate tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent bipartisan spirit of the time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|EastEnders: E20 {{originally}} aired {{as part of}} {{the main}} show's 25th anniversary celebrations. It was devised in a bid to develop and nurture new talent, including writers, actors, composers and remixers, and target a younger audience, as well as to attempt to drive more people onto the Internet. The series <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> executive producers Diederick Santer, who wanted a show where regular EastEnders characters would be in the background, and John Yorke, who wanted to improve the portrayal of teenagers in EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it.|$|E

5|$|Shades of Deep Purple is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band Deep Purple, {{released}} in July 1968 on Tetragrammaton in the United States and in September 1968 on Parlophone in the United Kingdom. The band, initially called Roundabout, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore {{before leaving the}} project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.|$|E
5|$|Silver City Airways {{moved to}} Lympne in 1948, {{operating}} Bristol Freighter Mk.21 aircraft and an aerial car ferry to Le Touquet started on 13 July 1948. The air ferry <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Griffith J Powell, {{who wanted to}} holiday in France but {{did not like the}} ferry. Bristol lent an aircraft for an experiment on 7 July 1948. The first car was Powell's Armstrong Siddeley 16 which was carried by G-AGVC.The Bristol Freighter Mk.21 could carry two cars. Although only 170 cars were carried in 1948, experience was gained.|$|E
5|$|The album <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager. Parker {{wished to}} release an Elvis Presley album through Boxcar Records—a company that he formed to manage Presley's {{commercial}} rights, {{so that he}} could profit directly from it. However, since Presley was signed to RCA Records, any recordings made would legally belong to RCA. To circumvent this restriction, Parker compiled audio of Presley talking—material over which RCA could not claim rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers was a {{major theme}} in the Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war featured in the programme of moral rejuvenation promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> prisoners of war as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to redeem France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always {{know what time it}} was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{collaboration}} with Martorell was a determining factor in Gaudí's recommendation for the Sagrada Família. The church <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Josep Maria Bocabella, {{founder of the}} Devotees of Saint Joseph Association, which acquired a complete block of Barcelona's Eixample district. The project was originally entrusted to Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, who planned {{the construction of a}} neo-Gothic church, on which work began in 1882. However, the following year Villar resigned due to disagreements with the construction board, and the task went to Gaudí, who completely redesigned the project, apart from the part of the crypt that had already been built. Gaudí devoted {{the rest of his life}} to the construction of the church, which was to be the synthesis of all of his architectural discoveries.|$|E

5|$|The {{blue and}} red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several {{competing}} theories have been put forth for the {{blue and red}} design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> his father as the colours {{were the same as}} the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.|$|E

The report, and an accompanying poem supposedly on the fountain describing the sleeping nymph, are now generally concluded to be a fifteenth-century forgery, but the motif proved influential among artists and landscape gardeners for several centuries after, with copies seen at neoclassical gardens such as the grotto at Stourhead.|$|E
