50|$|Taking the odd {{permutations}} of {{the above}} coordinates <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs gives another form, the enantiomorph of the other one. Though {{it may not be}} immediately obvious, the figure obtained by taking the even permutations <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs is the same as that obtained by taking the odd permutations <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs. Similarly, the mirror image has either <b>an</b> odd permutation <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs or <b>an</b> even permutation <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs.|$|R

Taking the even permutations <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs, and the odd permutations <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs, gives a different snub cube, the mirror image.

40|$|The {{subject of}} study of game theory - games - serves as {{mathematical}} models for real-life problems. In every game {{there are two}} or more players who aim to maximize their own profit by choosing their actions. A situation where no player can benefit from changing his own action alone has got particular importance {{in the study of}} games - it is called Nash equilibrium. Games <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players have certain advantages over those <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players. For one, problems whose model is <b>a</b> game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players are quite common. Moreover, one of the classical results of game theory is that (with certain additional assumptions) in every game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players there exists a Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, when trying to describe the properties of <b>a</b> game <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players {{we might be able to}} use calculus instead of going trough all possibilities (as is common for games <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players), which tends to be computationally demanding. However, if we want to use these advantages <b>of</b> games <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players, it is important first to know whether there is any relationship between games <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finite and infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players at all.

50|$|The {{topology}} of {{the light}} path was that of <b>a</b> Sagnac interferometer <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> reflections. Sagnac interfometers offer excellent contrast and fringe stability, and the configuration <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> reflections is only slightly less stable than the configuration <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> reflections. (<b>With</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> reflections, the oppositely traveling beams are laterally inverted with {{respect to each other}} over most {{of the light}} path, so that the topology deviates slightly from strict common path.) The relative immunity of his apparatus to vibration, mechanical stress and temperature effects, allowed Hammar to detect fringe displacements as little as 1/10 of a fringe, despite using the interferometer outdoors in <b>an</b> open environment <b>with</b> no temperature control.|$|R
50|$|The {{hysteresis}} effect is negligible on ACSR conductors with even <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> aluminium layers {{and so it}} is not considered in these cases. For ACSR conductors <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> aluminium layers however, a magnetization factor is used to accurately calculate the AC resistance. The correction method for single-layer ACSR is different than that used for three-layer conductors. Due to applying the magnetization factor, <b>a</b> conductor <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> layers has <b>an</b> AC resistance slightly higher than <b>an</b> equivalent conductor <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> layers.|$|R
