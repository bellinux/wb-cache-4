40|$|Abstract. For {{the need}} of high speed and load {{capacity}} of precision industry, a bearing used in a high speed spindle is studied. The hydrodynamic bearing composed a hydrodynamic bearing made of porous material and several hydrostatic <b>chambers</b> <b>with</b> an external <b>oil</b> system. The hydrodynamic bearing is pressurized <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> and supports the spindle shaft both at rest and at rotation state. Because of the external pressure and the property of porous material, the load capacity of hydraulic bearing can be promoted without decreasing precision. To consider the relationship of parameters, we applied the Reynolds equation and Darcy’s law to describe {{the flow of the}} oil film between bearing and spindle shaft...|$|R
50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing <b>chamber,</b> the <b>oil</b> reservoir and the sight glasses. Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an oil control valve. Sight glasses are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each sight glass. The body is also fitted <b>with</b> an <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> drain for draining the condensed water from the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
30|$|By {{comparing}} Figures  14 and 15, one can {{see that}} when the piston rod is not subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused to {{the periphery of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> in an elliptical shape. When the piston rod is subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused into a square shape and the pressure in the oil return groove is low. Additionally, the pressure around the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> gradually decreases and the pressure cloud map changes from orange to yellow, light green, and light blue in sequence. The pressure drop gradient is large and the pressure drop is significant. This is because the gap between the piston rod and sealing oil edge is reduced when the rod is subjected to a partial load. The oil in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> experiences increased resistance through the return oil gap and the return oil flow rate decreases. Therefore, the pressure in the return oil groove is lower than that without a partial load. The reduced return oil flow causes the pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> to rise and the oil film pressure drop between the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> and return <b>oil</b> groove increases.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in ship traffic in Arctic waters the later years, this challenges today's ship design. One of the challenges is the contact loads that occur, due to ice blocks encountering the ship propeller. The ice propeller interaction is a complicated process, and more knowledge on the effect of the ice propeller interaction on the ship propulsion drive train is needed. This master thesis focus on improving the dynamic mathematical model of one of the ship propulsion drive train components, namely the flexible coupling. The model developed is based on the Geislinger flexible coupling, and is developed using the bond graph approach with the 20 -sim simulation software. It takes in to account the major dynamic effects of the radially aligned springs and the oil flow between the <b>oil</b> <b>chambers.</b> Simulations show that the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficient of the flexible coupling model developed in this project, is heavily dependent on the deflection frequency and velocity. Both the damping factor and stiffness increases with frequency. This is due to an increase in both the amount of oil that is compressed, and the pressure difference between the <b>oil</b> <b>chambers</b> increases, <b>with</b> increasing deflection velocity. Simulations show that the static stiffness is mainly dependent on the geometry of the radially aligned springs, and that the dynamic stiffness is heavily dependent on the coefficient of discharge describing the oil flow between the <b>oil</b> <b>chambers</b> of the coupling. The coupling model was implemented in to a marine propulsion drive train established in another project, which was subjected to torsional ice impact loads, and compared to the original model. Simulations did show that the oil compressibility caused the flexible coupling to become stiffer than the reference model, during the rapid change of <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> volume. While the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> volume change was less, the flexible coupling became less stiff than the reference model. It is recommended that the tapering of the radially aligned springs is included in the model as this affects the flexible coupling stiffness, especially during impact loads. Also it is recommended that CFD simulations are performed to verify the coefficient of discharge used in the model. </p...|$|R

It will be large axial force to the valve body If the system working pressure is greater. The resulting outcome is low vibration frequency of the rotary valve driven hydraulic exciter. How to improve the hydraulic exciter frequency?We can improve {{the speed of the}} rotary valve or increase the number of rotary valve guide groove. But if we increase the tank guided number,the diameter of the rotary valve spoo must be increased. Design a rotary valve without axial force can solve the problem of the rotary valve spool shaft size restricted. By calculation and analysis of the rotary valve spool suffered axial force.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> of each <b>oil</b> pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter <b>oil</b> cushion decreases <b>with</b> increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>chambers</b> in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R

40|$|Development {{of sensors}} {{to detect the}} {{location}} and depth of hard pans in real time is a major restriction on the application of Site Specific Crop Management (SSCM). In this study, a soil compaction profile sensor equipped with four horizontal operating penetro-meters for on-the-go sensing and mapping of the location and intensity of hard pans arti-ficially formed in a soil bin was developed and tested. The leading edge of a 600 mm long vertical soil cutting blade held four 8 mm diameter, 80 mm long, and 30 degree conic tip stainless steel soil penetrating rods equally spaced at 100 mm vertical intervals. With this arrangement, when the cutting blade was driven into the soil up to a 500 mm depth, the conic tips sensed soil penetration resistances at 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm depths. The penetration resistance force was transmitted by the rod end to the elastic diaphragm of a hydrostatic <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> beneath each rod. Each <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> was connected to a force magnifying piston and cylinder located off the soil engaging tools.

40|$|The liquid {{carried by}} the {{combined}} drain system mainly contains water, heavy liquid hydrocarbons and mixed light end hydrocarbon gas (VOC) /Acid Gas (e. g. H 2 S mixture). The liquid was routed to a small horizontal pressure vessel to flash-off trapped gas and carryover oil is skimmed in an open sump downstream of the vessel. Increased flow rate to the close drain flash system has decreased the retention time and thus results in adequate flashing of lighter hydrocarbons and acid gas from the closed drain influent coming into the old vessel. This has created a potential environment and safety hazard for the people working around that vessel when the flashing of residual hydrocarbon and acid gas occurs in the sump, which is open to atmosphere. The mitigation of the problem involved designing a large horizontal tank with a heating coil and <b>oil</b> separation <b>chamber,</b> which can provide adequate retention time for the VOC/acid gas to flash off from the influent liquid. The <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> will collect hydrocarbon-oil after the de-emulsification process. Mechanical agitation, by using the desanding nozzle, prevents accumulation of sand {{at the bottom of}} the vessel. The project aims at the prevention of the carryover <b>oil</b> <b>with</b> outlet water into the biological process reactor downstream of the new tank. The accumulated oil is analyzed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the depletion of fossil fuel resources and the environmental benefits motivates the use of vegetable oils, however there is little known information about ignition and combustion characteristics of vegetable oil based fuels under off diesel engine conditions. These conditions are normally reached either during starting or when the engine is sufficiently worn out. A fuel was prepared by co-solvent blending of coconut <b>oil</b> <b>with</b> 20 % butyl alcohol and was analysed. An experimental study of the measurement of ignition delay (ID) characteristics of conical fuel sprays impinging on hot surface in cylindrical combustion chamber was carried out. The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of hot surface temperatures on ignition delays of microemulsion of coconut oil at various ambient air pressures and temperatures which would have reached under off diesel engine conditions. An experimental set-up was designed and developed for a maximum air pressure of 200  bar and a maximum temperature of 800  °C with the emphasis on optical method for the measurement of ignition delay. Hot surface temperature range chosen was 300 – 450  °C and ambient air pressure (inside the combustion chamber) range chosen was 10 – 25  bar. Present study shows that at fixed injection pressure and fixed ambient (hot surface) temperature, at higher ambient air pressure (25  bar) inside the combustion chamber, ignition delay of diesel and microemulsion of coconut oil are comparable and therefore are having matching combustion characteristics. Although a pressure of 25  bar is much less than the precombustion pressure of most diesel engines but again conclusively establish that combustion characteristics are same despite lower air pressure, temperature and lower injection pressure. At higher injection pressure ignition delay of microemulsion of coconut oil and pure diesel attains the lower value at the same ambient air pressure inside the combustion chamber. It can also be seen that at fixed injection pressure and higher ambient temperature conditions, ignition delay variations of microemulsion of coconut <b>oil</b> <b>with</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure show approximate same trend as that of conventional diesel fuel...|$|R

This is because of effection of the rotor rotation. The maximum velocity mainly exists in pump cover. Futhermore, flow characteristic curve is compared with the experimental result.

5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated servo mechanism {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber.</b> The outlets of the <b>oil</b> <b>chamber</b> are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”. The equation for the willan’s line is given by: ...|$|R
