5|$|William Henry Seward (May 16, 1801 – October 10, 1872) was United States Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869, {{and earlier}} served as Governor of New York and United States Senator. A {{determined}} {{opponent of the}} spread of slavery in the {{years leading up to}} the American Civil War, he was a dominant figure in the Republican Party in its formative years, and was praised for his <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of the Union as Secretary of State during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of women's suffrage, Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they were {{instrumental}} in founding the short-lived Woman's State Temperance Society (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But {{the relationship between the}} women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's suffrage filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, perceived to be largely a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E
5|$|The family {{settled in}} a small cottage in Finchley, now a north London suburb, but then a village. Octavia Hill was {{impressed}} and moved by Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, a book that portrayed {{the daily lives of}} slum dwellers. She was also strongly influenced by the theologian, Anglican priest and social reformer F. D. Maurice, who was a family friend. She began her <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of London's poor by helping to make toys for Ragged school children, and serving as secretary of the women's classes at the Working Men's College in Bloomsbury in central London.|$|E

5|$|Gillibrand's legal {{representation}} of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had {{voted in favor of}} all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Through his <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of the League of Nations, Nansen {{helped to}} {{establish}} the principle of international responsibility for refugees. Immediately after his death the League set up the Nansen International Office for Refugees, a semi-autonomous body under the League's authority, to continue his work. The Nansen Office faced great difficulties, in part arising from {{the large numbers of}} refugees from the European dictatorships during the 1930s. Nevertheless, it secured the agreement of 14 countries (including a reluctant Great Britain) to the Refugee Convention of 1933. It also helped to repatriate 10,000 Armenians to Yerevan in Soviet Armenia, and to find homes for a further 40,000 in Syria and Lebanon. In 1938, the year in which it was superseded by a wider-ranging body, the Nansen Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{discharge}} from the WAAAF, Stevenson resumed {{her career as a}} senior executive with Berlei, and remained with the company until her retirement in 1960. Parallel to her work at Berlei, she was a trustee of the Services Canteens Trust Fund in Melbourne, maintaining her links with the organisation for the next forty years. The fund administered surplus monies from wartime service canteens for the families of former soldiers. Stevenson obtained a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Melbourne in 1948. A founding patron of the Council of Ex-Servicewomen's Associations, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours for her welfare <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of female veterans.
