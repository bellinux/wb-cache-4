5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters {{complaining about the}} inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were irrelevant {{to the business of}} selecting fiction.|$|E

5|$|British R {{continued}} to be played in the Northern Soul club scene, where early soul records, particularly those of Motown, were highly prized. There were also bands on the London pub rock circuit. Occasional R pub rock acts like Dr Feelgood managed to build a following through tireless touring. They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity (1976), but failed to make a significant impact in the US. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of disco music, British soul music became popular in the mid-late 1970s.|$|E

In 1998, Georgia Tech was the first university in the Southeastern United States to provide its fraternity and sorority houses with internet access. A campus wireless network, the Local Area Wireless/Walkup Network (LAWN), was established in 1999; it now covers most of the campus.|$|E

Some of {{the earliest}} forms of Asian martial arts, such as kalarippayattu, musti yuddha, silambam, and marma adi, originated in India. Chess, commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga, is regaining widespread popularity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> {{in the number of}} Indian grandmasters.

5|$|In {{subsequent}} decades, republicanism would regain {{lost ground}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism.

5|$|In the 20th century, many {{individuals}} with Down syndrome were institutionalized, {{few of the}} associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the eugenics movement, 33 of the then 48 U.S. states and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability.
