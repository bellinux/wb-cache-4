40|$|When {{suppliers}} offer temporary discounts, retailers {{must decide}} the proper size of ordering. EOQ {{is used to}} determine ordering size. However in production process, not all products is in good condition. The presence of defective products is a natural thing, {{this is due to}} production quality is not perfect. Moreover, the fact that the capacity of the warehouse has a certain limit. Therefore, it is necessary EOQ model that takes into account three factors: product defects, temporary <b>discounts,</b> and limited <b>warehouse</b> capacity. EOQ model in this study refers to the formulation of inventory in the two warehouses by considering imperfect products and formulations inventory with temporary <b>discounts</b> and limited <b>warehouse</b> capacity. The level of demand for the product are deterministic and defective goods with a certain level is known. Two types of ordering size used in this model is the normal ordering and special ordering. Temporary discount is given if the retailer ordered with special sizes or at the first time ordered a normal size for a certain period. Furthermore, the process of checking the delivered products from suppliers to retailers. Defective products are sold at a cheaper price than good products. This model provides an optimal solution by the total inventory cost savings. Numerical example is presented to illustrate application of the model. The sensitivity analysis showed that the increase {{in the value of the}} capacity of the <b>warehouse</b> and temporary <b>discount</b> fraction causes increased value of decision variables, inventory costs, total sales, and total profit. While the increase in the fraction of the holding cost causes a decrease in the value of the decision variable, inventory costs, total sales, and total profit.
