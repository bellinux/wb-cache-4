5|$|As noted below, such a {{cloud of}} {{collectors}} would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> be too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{began his}} legal career at {{international}} law firm Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis in Cleveland, Ohio, {{where he worked}} from 1961 to 1967. He was highly regarded {{at the law firm}} and <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> have been made a partner but later said he had long intended to teach. He became {{a professor of law at}} the University of Virginia in 1967, moving his family to Charlottesville.|$|E
50|$|Execution {{loomed over}} the pair {{in a number}} of {{different}} states; had they been tried by Florida, Illinois or Tennessee, they <b>would</b> have <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> been electrocuted. Had they been tried by Colorado or Missouri, they <b>would</b> have <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> been gassed. Ultimately, they were tried by Kansas, where hanging was the prescribed method of execution.|$|R

5|$|Should {{the human}} race become extinct, then the various {{features}} assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000years. The last surviving structures <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or the sculptures at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} {{consequences of}} the collapse of their company were mitigated be a series of three benefit performances, in coordination with the local Russian-language theater company. Sonya returned to Odessa to give birth to their daughter Rivka; Adler stayed on six weeks in Zhytomyr and had sort of a belated apprenticeship with two Russian character actors of national fame, Borisov and Philipovsky. However, he returned to Odessa thinking that he <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> leave theater behind.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{existing}} double track {{all the way}} from Oslo to Moss, a further upgrade southwards {{will not be able to}} increase capacity past the current single train per hour to Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden. The most optimistic plans involve finishing the first upgrades of track south of Moss simultaneously with the Follo Line. The Rail Administration and Ministry of Transport is working on proposals for a high-speed railway between Oslo and Gothenburg in Sweden. This line <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> use the Follo Line for the initial distance from Oslo.|$|E

5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil. P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, {{and is expected to}} fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E
5|$|Noreen's husband, Ashiq Masih, 51 {{years old}} at the time, {{announced}} that he planned to appeal the verdict, which has to be upheld by the Lahore High Court. A month later, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab who investigated the affair for the President Asif Ali Zardari, stated that Noreen <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> be pardoned if the High Court did not suspend the sentence. Zardari was poised to grant pardon but Lahore High Court issued a stay order against potential Presidential pardon, which remains in force till date. Court transcripts show numerous inconsistencies in the evidence presented and reporters say they dare not repeat Bibi's testimony lest they also be accused of blasphemy.|$|E

50|$|A jenderal besar could {{technically}} {{be appointed}} if ever Indonesia became {{engaged in a}} major war or suffered from a massive invasion. A jenderal besar <b>would</b> then, <b>most</b> <b>likely,</b> become supreme commander of all Indonesian military forces.|$|R

After Yours Truly was released, the album went to number one on the iTunes Store charts in over fifty countries, including the United States, where it reached number one in nineteen minutes. Yours Truly officially debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart, with 138,000 copies sold in its first week, becoming Grande's first number-one album as a solo artist.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Saw III, Twisted Pictures and Brash Entertainment {{announced}} they were planning to create a game based on the Saw property. Although no release was confirmed, they stated that the game <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> release alongside Saw IV. Originally, Brash Entertainment was going to develop the game and co-publish it with Twisted Pictures, the producers of all of the Saw films. The game's plot was originally to follow that of the first Saw film, with the player assuming control of various characters in Jigsaw's traps, but this was later changed as development progressed.|$|E
5|$|Qatar is {{required}} to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU {{in order to have}} a chance to take part, as Qatar Radio is only a radio station and Qatar lies outside the European Broadcasting Area and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> be Qatar Television (QTV) also owned and run by the Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation (QGBTC). If Qatar Radio gets accepted too, then they would be able to air the contest alongside the television broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{credited}} for {{securing the}} trolley for Kinetic, Zara faced {{criticism in the}} boardroom for being the only person on either team who failed to sell anything. She <b>would</b> have <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> been fired had Kinetic lost.|$|R

60|$|There was {{no doubt}} that the practice, like all other illegal ones, was demoralizing to the community, and {{particularly}} fatal to the character of that class of bold, enterprising young men who <b>would</b> be <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to be drawn into it.|$|R
5|$|The sticky {{bomb was}} a glass flask filled with {{nitroglycerin}} and given an adhesive coating {{allowing it to}} be glued to a passing vehicle. In theory, it could be thrown, but in practice it <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> need to be placed—thumped against the target with sufficient force to stick—requiring courage and good fortune to be used effectively. An order for one million sticky bombs was placed in June 1940, but various problems delayed their distribution in large numbers until early 1941, {{and it is likely}} that fewer than 250,000 were produced.|$|E
5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee <b>would,</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely,</b> be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E

50|$|The Bishop score grades {{patients}} who <b>would</b> be <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> {{to achieve a}} successful induction. The duration of labor is inversely correlated with the Bishop score; a score that exceeds 8 describes the patient <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to achieve a successful vaginalbirth. Bishop scores of less than 6 usually require that a cervical ripening method be used before other methods.|$|R
60|$|Three {{days after}} my {{arrival at the}} village, Kua-ko {{returned}} with his companion.

5|$|On February 18, 1898, Muñoz Rivera's son, Luis Muñoz Marín, was born. By {{this time}} the family had moved to Old San Juan, where Luis was born. On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera's home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk {{off the coast of}} Cuba, which <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> spark a war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa {{expected}} the American government to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure. Barbosa insisted that this would not happen, continuing his support towards a military operation.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E
5|$|The OKL was {{not happy}} about {{supporting}} Cerberus. Jeschonnek remarked to Galland that if Cerberus failed then the Luftwaffe would be made a scapegoat. Jeschnonnek was to be proved right. During the 12 January 1942 meeting, the Navy demanded maximum fighter cover be given and won Hitler's support. Should anything go wrong, the Navy <b>would</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> blame the Luftwaffe for damage sustained by enemy air forces. During the meeting Jeschonnek stood his ground and refused to give any guarantees or to reinforce the Western Fighter Forces from other theatres. Galland was given executive power for the air operation which was given the code name Unternehmen Donnerkeil (Operation Thunderbolt). The existence of the operation was so secret that both Jeschonnek and Galland had to sign secrecy pledges as they left Hitler's Headquarters in East Prussia.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic or volant, Ichthyoconodon <b>would</b> {{have been}} <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> carnivorous. Eutriconodonts possess several adaptations towards carnivory, {{including}} shearing molars {{like those of}} modern carnivorous mammals.|$|R
