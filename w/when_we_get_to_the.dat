500|$|The {{books have}} also been widely critiqued as promoting, normalizing, and idealizing an emotionally and {{physically}} abusive relationship. Sci-fi website io9 noted that Bella and Edward's relationship meets all fifteen criteria set by the National Domestic Violence Hotline for being in an abusive relationship. L. Lee Butler of Young Adult Library Services Association commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the Twilight books in his library because he felt the books were [...] "robbing [...] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior." [...] Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like Jezebel, The Frisky, and Salon.com have decried Twilight as promoting an anti-woman message. Bitch magazine stated the novels [...] "had created a new, popular genre of [...] "abstinence porn", concluding that, [...] "In reality, the abstinence message—wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn—objectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn might. The Twilight books conflate Bella losing her virginity {{with the loss of}} other things, including her sense of self and her very life. Such a high-stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless, an object, a fact that is highlighted <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sex scenes in Breaking Dawn." [...] Ms. declared that Twilight promotes a physically abusive relationship and an anti-abortion message. [...] However, writer Angela Aleiss of Religion News Service said that contrary to popular opinion, Mormons do permit abortion when the mother's life is in danger. [...] Bella's refusal to abort her fetus, along with her quick marriage and pregnancy, instead underscore the Mormon emphasis on family.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, lad, {{your story}} sounds truthful, and will, of course, be inquired into <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> England. As to this man, {{he is of}} course a prisoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bell is {{our real}} {{antagonist}} and he's an awkward man to beat," [...] he said. [...] "However, the hint {{you have given}} us ought to be useful. I'll look for a way down <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well he can’t {{prevent us}} {{looking at each}} other," [...] said Flower, [...] "and he can’t prevent us marrying <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other end. Good-night, Jack. Next time you see us we’ll be an old married couple." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I dono. But robbers {{always have}} orgies, {{and of course}} we've got to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skiff." ...|$|E
