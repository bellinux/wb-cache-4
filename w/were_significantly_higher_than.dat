5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire into the other. So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} run out, and instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat the ragged holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his femoral artery. Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E

This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke's Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest {{in the country}} for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.|$|E
25|$|Irrevocability principle: The fusion {{approach}} assumes that, once developed, fusion {{will remain}} largely stable over time. This stability persists even in varying situations. Identity fusion theory proposes {{that this is}} due to the strong emotions, beliefs, and intra-relationships experienced by the strongly fused individuals. That is, although the overall fusion of a group of persons may shift in response to powerful situational forces, the rank orderings of individuals within the group will remain stable. Researchers have tested the “once fused, always fused” hypothesis by comparing the temporal stability of fusion-with-country scores for highly fused individuals with those of moderately or weakly fused individuals. The stability coefficients for highly fused participants <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the coefficients associated with weakly or moderately fused participants. Even when ostracized strongly fused individuals will go to serious lengths to reaffirm their steadfastness to the group.|$|E
25|$|RCA {{inherited}} American Marconi's {{status as}} a major producer of vacuum tubes, which were branded Radiotron in the United States. Especially after the rise of broadcasting, they were a major profit source for the company. RCA's strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> in Europe, where Lee de Forest had allowed a key patent issued to him to lapse. RCA was responsible for creating a series of innovative products, ranging from octal base metal tubes co-developed with General Electric before World War II, to miniaturized Nuvistor tubes used in the tuners of the New Vista series of TV sets. The Nuvistor tubes were a last major vacuum tube innovation, and were meant {{to compete with the}} newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the cathode ray tube (CRT) picture tube.|$|E

500|$|Typhoon Agnes {{originated}} from an isolated area of convection {{located near the}} equator on October28. Satellite imagery indicated a possible low pressure area near 149° E. Although the disturbance was not attached to the monsoon trough, an upper-level anticyclone became situated aloft, providing the system with strong ventilation. Midday on October30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgrading the system to a tropical depression on the same day. Late on October31, shower activity increased drastically in both coverage and organization as the disturbance tracked northwest. Early the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Shortly thereafter, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system and found winds of these winds <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> intensity estimates from the Dvorak technique. At 06:00 UTC on November1, the JTWC issued its first warning on the system, upgrading it to a tropical storm and naming it Agnes. The JMA also classified Agnes as a tropical storm at this time.|$|E
