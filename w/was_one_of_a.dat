5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster {{and a number of}} bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with many}} others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the Russian Revolution of 1917. She saw {{communism}} as {{the shape of the}} future, and when the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920, Wilkinson <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group of ILP members with Marxist leanings who became founder members. For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.|$|E
5|$|Compton <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{handful of}} {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, {{which was published in}} 1935.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{withdrawal}} from the area around Orsogna, the 2nd New Zealand Division <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of divisions that was transferred from the Eighth Army to the Fifth Army, then engaged {{on the western side}} of the Apennines. This was part of an overall strategy to breach the Gustav Line and break an otherwise deadlocked Italian front.

The corps moved to Cassino, the defenders of which had resisted American forces for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 3634 b <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{sample of}} over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers {{in search of}} planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1745, Crossford Bridge– which dated back to {{at least}} 1367– was torn down.

The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester, {{and used it to}} send a small force into Sale and Altrincham. Their intention was to deceive the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester. The feint was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through Cheadle and Stockport instead.|$|E
