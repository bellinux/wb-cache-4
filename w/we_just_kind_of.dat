So, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wanted to change it up and do something a little different." [...] Further elaboration was also given on the 'science fiction concept album' idea, with Cronise explaining that [...] "It's psychedelic, in a way. It's not like Star Wars science fiction ... laser guns and action all the time. It's more cerebral in that it's still mythological in the way it's told. It's science fiction and there's spaceships and robots, but it doesn't take place in the future. It's just like another planet far away sort of thing. Otherworldly. And of course, it will have universal-type themes in it. I wanted to create a completely original kind of setting to have the songs take place in." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bass Down Low" [...] {{was written}} by Dev {{alongside}} the production duo The Cataracs. The duo also produced the song, and recorded it at The Indie-Pop Sweat Shop. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City. The song was originally conceived with Dev as a featured act, but she was later made the main artist as they believed it represented her. Dev described [...] "Bass Down Low" [...] as [...] "sassy and fun" [...] and considered it a great follow-up to [...] "Like a G6". In an interview with teen magazine Seventeen, she spoke of the song's conception, stating: [...] "We'd been in the studio writing some really bossy, fun stuff. We've got a studio in the loft {{that we live in}} together, so it was made in there. <b>We</b> were <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> kickin' it and it came.

[...] "It’s really unfortunate. I hate it for these Axalta guys. Everybody at Hendrick Motorsports worked so hard. They brought a great race car here, brand new and destroyed it. Really unfortunate, but it’s not anybody’s fault. We didn’t hit anything <b>we</b> <b>just</b> must have run over something." [...] Mears said he [...] "was going into the corner and I saw him come up all of a sudden. I don’t know. It’s too bad he didn’t put us out of our misery there. We were having a rough start <b>of</b> it. <b>We</b> were <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hanging on and actually those guys were going by us. They either blew a right-front (tire) or had something come loose or something and came up into us.” Mears went on to finish 40th.

5000|$|Carney {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the quality of the finished record: We paid $350 to get it mastered, took it home and there was, like, no bass on it. And we just dropped it in a FedEx envelope, mailed it to Warner Brothers and were done with it. Of all things that we've ever done, that's my biggest regret — is that <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> were like, [...] "Oh, OK." ...|$|E
50|$|In another interview, McCready stated:I came in {{with that}} riff and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> started jamming on it. It was a blast to play. The track that {{actually}} ended up on there, halfway through the song, Matt lost his headphones. He was going off. That's my favorite part of that song, his crazy drum fills. I like the solo too, but the drum fills are insane how good they are. He's doing them without his headphones, just by watching the bass.|$|E
5000|$|... "The song is simple.

We have this surreal <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dance sequence, and it features synchronized swimmers and showgirls. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> throw a little extra twist on it. We wanted to mix a current, modern feel with an old-school, classic Hollywood feel because the song has <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a big-band quality to it as well as a more modern dance-song quality. We wanted to mix the two different parts." ...|$|R
2500|$|The band {{initially}} {{planned to}} release Wah Wah simultaneously with Laid, or perhaps to release them {{together as a}} double album or to release Wah Wah as a free giveaway with Laid, but these plans were shelved when the band's record label, Fontana Records, were initially reluctant to release Wah Wah. Glennie recalled [...] "we bumped into problems with the record company’s {{ability to deal with}} [...] I think they thought it would confuse people, which is a shame, really. I wish now in reflection <b>we</b> had <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pushed them regardless and done it." [...] Laid itself was released alone by the label on 5 October 1993. It was the band's biggest success to date, receiving some of the band's best reviews, and it was also their first album to chart in the United States and ultimately their most successful there, peaking at number 72 on the Billboard 200 chart and later being certified Gold by the RIAA for selling 600,000 copies there. It success was largely due to the lead single, [...] "Laid", which became a crossover hit in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Thematically, Pain Is Beauty {{is said to}} {{be largely}} about idealistic love. Though Wolfe has also stated [...] "It’s not a {{conceptual}} album. There’s {{a lot of different things}} it’s about: it’s about ancestry, it’s about nature, it’s about tormented love and sort of overcoming the odds. There’s a lot of different themes on this album." [...] According to Wolfe, the red dress she is wearing on the album cover represents volcanic lava. Regarding the album title, Wolfe admitted, [...] "...there’s always gonna be situations that we go through that are really hard and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> have to <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> be strong, and if we get through to the other side, then we become wiser people and our lives become more beautiful." ...|$|R
5000|$|Keselowski, who {{finished}} runner-up, said his race [...] "was {{a good day}} for us, not the win. I think we had the speed capable to pull it off, but still a really strong day. The car was good. The team executed really well, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> missed out on the racing Gods today. We have a lot to be proud of, a great effort, and showed that we’re still a strong team if not the strongest in the garage and I’m really proud of that.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{band was}} brought {{together}} by step brothers Sam and Jack who attended different schools in Cheltenham where the band are from (with {{the exception of}} Joe Lever who lives in Birmingham).

5000|$|Songwriters David Spradley, Garry Shider, and George Clinton created [...] "Atomic Dog" [...] in a {{recording}} studio in January 1982, working without a written score... Testimony at trial indicated that the song was composed spontaneously - Spradley recorded the initial tracks {{in the studio and}} recalled that [...] "when George arrived he had been partying pretty heavily so he was, you know, feeling pretty good," [...] and was unsteady at the microphone. Spradley and Garry Shider [...] "got on either side of him. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> kept him in front of the microphone" [...] while Clinton recorded the vocal tracks that same night... Testimony by David Spradley... also demonstrated that Clinton exercised some degree of creative control over the panting by instructing the performers to create a certain rhythm.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 61. The third caution of {{the race}} flew on lap 62 for a two-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Chris Buescher got loose and tapped the left-rear corner of Dale Earnhardt Jr. He got loose, came across the nose of A. J. Allmendinger and sent them both into the wall. Earnhardt continued down the backstretch and spun down the track. Earnhardt said afterwards that he [...] "knew I {{was going to hit}} the wall. The No. 34 (Buescher) just drove into the left front quarter panel. Oh, man. I don’t know; them restarts and all that. You’ve got a responsibility to try and take care of everybody out there even when you’re three-wide. I’m disappointed in that. But, we had a pretty good car and <b>we</b> were <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> taking our time, there. And the car was great. So, it’s a shame.” When asked about the wreck from his point of view, Allmendinger said he wasn't “really sure. I think Junior got hit and I was on the outside of him and that was it. It was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> weird back there. I’m not really sure what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> car we had. I thought in clean air we weren’t too bad, but I guess a lot of people could say that. Just not a lot of fun racing there.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Whilst on tour, {{the band}} became reacquainted with Claritys {{producer}} Mark Trombino, {{and decided to}} work with him once again for their forthcoming album. Trombino also produced the band's second studio album, Static Prevails (1996), and their commercial breakthrough, Bleed American (2001). Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking the songs as far as they could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] "Mark would do a mix of it and add production ideas and <b>we</b> would <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> go back and forth like that. He is the wizard at computers, and the history that we have working with him we don't have with anybody else, so it made sense on the familiarity level and the ease of working level." [...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|R
