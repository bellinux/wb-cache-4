5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|FETA {{began to}} be {{concerned}} over the structural <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> the bridge in the 21st century. The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge (30,000vehicles per day in each direction) was routinely exceeded as traffic levels outstripped predictions. The Scottish Government stated in 2006 that 60,000vehicles travelled on {{more than half the}} days in a year. This raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge, originally planned at 120 years.|$|E

5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> connection and disconnection. The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from mechanical <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> existing volcanic rock.|$|E
5|$|To avoid further <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover. Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E

5|$|The HVO {{advanced}} north along {{two main}} axes of attack. The western axis advanced from Šuica {{along the main}} road towards Kupres, capturing the village of Donji Malovan on 1 November. The eastern axis of the HVO offensive moved from Ravno towards Rilić. Just as the HVO began to move north, the ARBiH suspended its westward advance. Various explanations for the pause were put forward, including fog, rain, need to secure territorial gains, <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> equipment and fatigue of personnel. Regardless, that day the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović telephoned Alagić requesting an adequate level of cooperation and avoidance of any conflicts with the HVO. Finally, Alagić made a public call to the HVO {{to participate in the}} offensive against the VRS in Kupres. The same day, the VRS targeted Bugojno using two 9K52 Luna-M missiles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wear</b> <b>of</b> the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, {{at the end of}} an individual's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E
5|$|Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on {{the other}} hand, {{maintain}} that the dentary is referable to Ferugliotherium and that the p4s of Argentodites and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to Ferugliotherium in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of Ferugliotherium teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) {{do not belong to}} Ferugliotherium, then, Gurovich and Beck argue, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals (Ferugliotherium and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar ecological niches—and one of those would be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted that the transition from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and Argentodites p4s to the extensive <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.|$|E

5|$|S. validum {{is known}} from the late Late Cretaceous Belly River Group (the Canadian {{equivalent}} to the Judith River Group in the US), and specimens have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5 to 75 mya) in Dinosaur Provincial Park (including the lectotype specimen), and the Oldman Formation (middle Campanian, 77.5 to 76.5 mya) of Alberta, Canada. The pachycephalosaurs Hanssuesia and Foraminacephale are also known from both formations. S. novomexicanum is {{known from the}} Fruitland (late Campanian, about 75 mya) and lower Kirtland Formation (late Campanian, about 74 mya) of New Mexico, and if this species correctly belongs in Stegoceras, the genus {{would have had a}} broad geographic distribution. The presence of similar pachycephalosaurs in both the west and north of North America during the latest Cretaceous shows that they were {{an important part of the}} dinosaur faunas there. It has traditionally been suggested that pachycehalosaurs inhabited mountain environments; <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> their skulls was supposedly a result of them having been rolled by water from upland areas, and comparisons with bighorn sheep reinforced the theory. In 2014, Jordan C. Mallon and Evans disputed this idea, as the wear and original locations of the skulls is not consistent with having been transported in such a way, and they instead proposed that North American pachycephalosaurs inhabited alluvial (associated with water) and coastal plain environments.|$|E
5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.|$|E
