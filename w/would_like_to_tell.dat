25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

When you start hearing the stories from a true perspective... of people who were {{actually}} there, it gives you a clear viewpoint of where you are as an artist and the story you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> It was a great experience to be there." ...|$|E
500|$|At 09:39, {{two minutes}} after Flight 77 {{impacted}} the Pentagon, {{air traffic controllers}} overheard Jarrah say, [...] "Here's the captain: I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you all to remain seated. We have a bomb aboard, {{and we are going}} back to the airport, and we have our demands. So please remain quiet." [...] Air traffic controllers did not hear from the flight again. Passengers and crew began making phone calls to officials and family members starting at 09:30 using GTE airphones and mobile phones. Altogether, the passengers and crew made 35 airphone calls and two cell phone calls from the flight. Ten passengers and two crew members were able to connect, providing information to family, friends, and others on the ground.|$|E

5000|$|Final Question in Miss Earth 2004: [...] "On a quiet night, {{you could}} hear the sounds of nature talking to you. What do you think is its message and what <b>would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it back?" ...|$|R

500|$|When the {{election}} was held, there was a 12 percent swing towards the Liberal Party in South Australia, or 7 percent on two party preferred. There was a large swing against Labor owing to the dissatisfaction with the Whitlam administration, but it generally {{went directly to the}} Liberal Party. Against this background, and with relatively little media attention paid to the LM and its cause, Despite gaining prominence for his stance on supply, Hall struggled to be re-elected, gaining only 6.5 per cent of the Senate vote and relying on preferences, ironically from Labor. In South Australia, Labor gained 41 per cent of the vote, and the Liberals 51 per cent. In the lower house, the LM managed only 6.2% across the 12 seats, again recording its best result in Boothby, with 10.4%. Hall's hope for Australia-wide support for the LM was dashed owing to the previous events, with the party gaining negligible results for their candidates in other states. The lower house candidates in the Australian Capital Territory registered around 3%, but the senate candidates in Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland received less than 1%. Hall's opinion was that [...] "the Liberal Movement was for its part in the contest happy to have survived." [...] Nevertheless, Hall was still adamant the LM's future was as a standalone entity: [...] "The LM is going to continue as an Australia-wide party ... We shall {{have to go through the}} sickening process of having the Liberal party make overtures to us once again ... I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them right now that they will be wasting their breath." [...] Despite Hall's defiance, the poor showing meant his senate term was only to last for three rather than six years, and he no longer had the balance of power and the resulting media exposure. This was a problem, as the party was largely centred around his personality.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981 Ian Botham hit 118, {{including}} six sixes (the second greatest number in an Ashes innings), {{which he has}} called [...] "one of the three innings I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my grandchildren about". England {{went on to win}} the Ashes after being lampooned in the national media for such poor performances.|$|E
2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that the machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, {{as a result of our}} trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E

6000|$|Flossie was tacking her {{way towards}} them. Joan acted on impulse. [...] "I wish you'd {{give me your}} address," [...] she said [...] "where I could write to you. Or perhaps you would not mind my coming and seeing you one day. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me more about my mother." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were [...] "discussing freely" [...] among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{introduce}} my young friends," [...] went on Mr. Passmore, and did so. [...] "They have got something they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|We relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed. [...] "There's {{something}} in this starlight that loosens one's tongue. I'm an ass, and yet somehow I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'll write to-night. <b>Would</b> you <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the girls}} about Trix and Sydney?" [...] she {{asked as she}} rose, feeling that the council was over.|$|R
6000|$|... “That depends. I really don’t want {{to cause}} you trouble. You see, I {{was fond of}} you once, Tony—and <b>would</b> you <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that I am still?” ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{minister}} rose. [...] "Then I really mustn't detain you, I suppose. Good-bye." [...] He {{offered his}} hand. Colville took it, {{but could not}} let it go at once. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> extremely <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you why I'm leaving Florence in such haste. But I don't see what good it would do, for I don't want you to persuade me to stay." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "More, perhaps, {{than you}} would think, madam," [...] he declared. [...] "He {{knows how to make}} a bargain, believe me. It cost us more than I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you to get these fellows here." ...|$|E
60|$|Somebody {{was turning}} the door-handle. He {{hoped it was}} Roscoe Sherriff. He had been rather dull the last time Sherriff had looked in. He would be quite {{different}} now. He would be gay and sparkling. He remembered two good stories he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Sherriff.|$|E
60|$|Tommy <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{her about}} Reddy, but forbore, because he still {{believed}} that he had acted criminally in that affair, and so {{for the time being}} the inquisition ended. But though he had already discovered all that Grizel knew about her mother and nearly all that curious Thrums ever ferreted out, he returned to the subject at the next meeting in the Den.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, not at all. She is {{just the}} same. I {{wondered}} whether I had better tell her my history. I wondered whether I might--I mean, whether you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her. I wondered,' said Little Dorrit, looking at him in a suppliant way, and gradually withdrawing her eyes {{as he looked at}} her, 'whether you would advise me what I ought to do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Jethro," [...] said Cynthia, [...] "Mr. Sutton {{does not}} believe me when I tell him that Cousin Ephraim has been made {{postmaster}} of Brampton. He <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have you <b>tell</b> him whether it is so or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are a few}} left, {{although}} their methods have changed with the times. Some day I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you about my uncle. He was, so to speak, a survival, and I think you would appreciate him. But how have things been going in the dale?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, father, I {{said nothing}} about it," [...] John said, before his mother could speak. [...] "I thought, in the first place, that you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them; and in the next, the people there had heard such {{magnified}} reports that I could not, for very shame, lay {{claim to be the}} hero they had pictured to themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came," [...] said Dora, {{with her}} most charming smile, [...] "because I saw you two in here, and I {{wanted to speak}} to you. It is a funny place {{for this sort of}} thing, but I do not see either of you very often, now, and I thought I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, before you heard it from any one else, of my engagement." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{remember}} {{that it was in}} a practical way that you were represented as being fitted for the clear exposition. Now, what you call first principles, I have, in some things, found to be more or less vague. Permit me, then, in a plain way, to suppose some common case in real life, and that done, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me how you, the practical disciple of the philosophy I wish to know about, would, in that case, conduct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} other, looking steadfastly at her companion, [...] "if you will promise {{to keep it}} all to {{yourself}} forever, I don't mind telling you that I was once in love. <b>Would</b> you <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you who I was in love with?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you {{were very}} patient and very persistent. You have won and I lost. I am {{not at all}} sure {{that it is not a}} good thing that I lost. My friend Deane tells me so even now. But let that go. I am sure you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me what it is that you have come here for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} of the sort," [...] he answered, smiling, [...] "because you are a nice girl. But, on the other hand, of course, I am {{glad to hear that}} your search, {{whatever}} it may be, is over. You can tell me about it or not, just as you please. Perhaps I may be able to help. Perhaps you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me. If not, it doesn't matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} written to Lizzie Hexam since I wrote {{and told her}} that I really had a lover--a whole one. I have often thought I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her how right she was when she pretended to read in the live coals that I would go through fire and water for him. I am in the humour to tell her so to-night, John, and I'll stay at home and do it.' ...|$|E
5000|$|However, the {{question}} : [...] "If God exists, what <b>would</b> you <b>like</b> Him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you when you're dead ?"

60|$|Mordaunt hesitated. He <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> Dick <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Jim, {{since this}} might lead {{the latter to}} take the cottage from Shanks. For all that, {{he did not see}} how he could persuade Dick to do so, because he did not want him to think he had an object.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you politicians!"
