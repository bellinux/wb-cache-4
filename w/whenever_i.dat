50|$|Every tree is {{a partial}} cube. For, suppose that a tree T has m edges, and number these edges (arbitrarily) from 0 to m &minus; 1. Choose a root vertex r for the tree, arbitrarily, and label each vertex v {{with a string}} of m bits that has a 1 in {{position}} <b>i</b> <b>whenever</b> edge <b>i</b> lies on the path from r to v in T. For instance, r itself will have a label that is all zero bits, its neighbors will have labels with a single 1-bit, etc. Then the Hamming distance between any two labels is the distance between the two vertices in the tree, so this labeling shows that T is a partial cube.|$|R
