Lauder to resign as Formula One chief {{after he had}} praised Adolf Hitler in a {{newspaper}} interview and said that Hitler “got things done.” Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views {{should not be allowed}} to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that [...] "I think the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> that haven't got the power to say these things." [...] Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: “It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out" [...] and “They have a lot of influence everywhere." [...] After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had “been an idiot.” ...|$|E

And this is an age of release, you say it is an age of release for the workers and they know it. And so do the women. Just as much. 'Wild hopes' indeed! The workers' hopes are nothing to the women's! It is not only the workers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> let us go free, manage things differently so that we may have our lives relieved from this intolerable burthen of constant toil, but the women also are saying let us go free. They are demanding release just as much from their intolerable endless specialization as females. The tramp on the roads who won't work, the swindler and the exploiter who contrive not to work, the strikers who throw down their tools, no longer for twopences and sixpences as you say but because their way of living is no longer tolerable to them, and we women, who don't bear children or work or help; we are all in one movement together. We are part of the General Strike. I have been a striker all my life. We are doing nothing--by the hundred thousand. Your old social machine is working without us and in spite of us, it carries us along with it and we are sand in the bearings. I'm not a wheel, Stephen, I'm grit. What you say about the reactionaries and suppressionists who would stifle the complaints of labor and crush out its struggles to be free, is exactly true about the reactionaries and suppressionists who would stifle the discussion of the woman's position and crush out her hopes of emancipation...." ...|$|E

This current craze that Christianity was a mystery religion like these other mystery religions-the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> this are almost always people who know nothing about the mystery religions; they've read a few popular books, but they're not scholars of mystery religions. The reality is, we know very little about mystery religions-the whole point of mystery religions is that they're secret! So I think it's crazy to build on ignorance in order to make a claim like this." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{main body}} of Anim Zemirot {{consists}} of 31 original verses, followed by two verses from Tanach: the first from Chronicles 29:11 and the second from Psalms 106:2. From the fifth to the twenty-eighth verse, the verses each begin with the successive letter in the Hebrew alphabet, except for the letter reish (...) and tav (...) , both of which appear twice. As there are an odd number of verses within the main body, the congregation traditionally recites the last verse of the main body along with the shaliach tzibbur. The last two verses are then recited alone {{by the members of}} the congregation; the shaliach tzibbur recites the verse from Psalms aloud to indicate the completion of Anim Zemirot and allow the members of the congregation <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> kaddish yatom ( [...] , Mourners' kaddish) to begin their recitation.|$|E

50|$|I am leaving Paris, {{after eight}} fateful months, with {{conflicting}} emotions. Looking {{at the conference}} in retrospect, {{there is much to}} approve and yet much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> that the treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris.|$|E

The University and the authors of the report rejected as invalid Casey's interpretation of their results. They have stated that her claim that children do better when raised by married heterosexuals is [...] "not valid based on our findings... no comparisons were made with gay or lesbian family constellations in the studies included in the review. Therefore, there is nothing whatsoever in our review that would justify the conclusion that same-sex parents cannot raise healthy children who do well."

5000|$|Many {{people in}} the {{worldwide}} parkour community also accused UF of distorting the image of parkour, associating it with the flips and artistic movements of freerunning and tricking.

The critics believed that freerunning, like parkour, should be a non-competitive activity.
