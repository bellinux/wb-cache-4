Prokofiev was so impressed by Rostropovich's performance that {{he was determined to}} write a Cello Sonata for him. At the same time, Prokofiev wrote the symphonic <b>suite</b> <b>Winter</b> Bonfire, Op. 122, the ballet The Tale of the Stone Flower, Op. 118, and the Pushkin Waltzes, Op. 120. The Cello Sonata was published in Moscow in 1951.|$|R
2500|$|The Russo {{brothers}} {{confirmed in}} August 2014 that Jackman {{would return to}} score [...] In July 2015, Jackman noted the industrial elements of his <b>Winter</b> Soldier <b>suite</b> from the previous film was an indication of what the new score would sound like, but did caution that [...] "it's just a jumping off point since the Russos are looking for something new—similar with a twist." [...] Once Jackman read the script for the film, {{he realized that the}} [...] "movie tonally was so different to the second one ... it’s sort of half Captain America, half an Avengers film in a way" [...] and so Jackman ultimately wrote a much more symphonic and orchestral score than he did for Winter Soldier. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as [...] "somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style ... some of the harmony and the orchestration really does get quite classical." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{numerical}} model designed {{to simulate the}} evolution of a snow layer on a road surface was forced by meteorological forecasts so as to assess its potential for use within an operational suite for road management in <b>winter.</b> The <b>suite</b> is intended for use throughout France, even in areas where no observations of surface conditions are available. It relies on short-term meteorological forecasts and long-term simulations of surface conditions using spatialized meteorological data to provide the initial conditions. The prediction of road surface conditions (road surface temperature and presence of snow on the road) was tested at an experimental site using data from a comprehensive experimental field campaign. The results were satisfactory, with detection of the majority of snow and negative road surface temperature events. The model was then extended to all of France with an 8 -km grid resolution, using forcing data from a real-time meteorological analysis system. Many events with snow on the roads were simulated for the 2004 / 05 winter. Results for road surface temperature were checked against road station data from several highways, and results for the presence of snow on the road were checked against measurements from the Météo-France weather station networ...|$|R
2500|$|Jackman first created {{three pieces}} of music for {{directors}} Anthony and Joe Russo: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute <b>suite</b> for the <b>Winter</b> Soldier; and a track representing Hydra. Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having [...] "enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, {{but not so much}} that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant", and stated that in the third act [...] "the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [...] to come through". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace [...] "those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic", such as when the character visits his own Smithsonian exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland. Jackman described the Winter Soldier as [...] "a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be [...] "inappropriate ... instead [...] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records." [...] In the <b>Winter</b> Soldier <b>suite,</b> [...] "the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral." [...] Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of [...] "tortured, time-stretched human cries of someone who has been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time but you can still hear the human in there". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more [...] "revealed {{toward the end of the}} film" [...] as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is and care about him. When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, [...] "I really want to hear that in the movie and not just 20% of" [...] it. For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the [...] "Wagnerian symphonic baddie music" [...] of the first film, and [...] "come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary." [...] Jackman also introduces a motif for the Falcon.|$|R
40|$|A 12 track, 45 minute {{album of}} {{original}} recorded works released under the project name 'Sleeps in Oysters'. Lo! {{was released in}} a glossy card gatefold sleeve with each standard edition accompanied by a hand-illustrated insert depicting each of the 12 animal masks featured in the album photography as a cross stitch chart. 50 hand numbered special edition packs were available each {{with one of the}} 12 animal masks featured on the sleeve, and a kit consisting of threads, fabric and thimble to enable the owner to ‘stitch their own’ matching miniature cross stitch. Lisa has been cross-stitching each of the 12 animal masks from date of release and her progress in photos can be followed on the Sleeps in Oysters blog. The album Lo! can be read as an exhaustive dissection of the perceived norms of both pop song, and pop album structures. Various tracks subvert the expectations of length, structure and placement of sung elements within the wider musical composition; whilst others present themselves in numerous parts over a number of tracks. The structure of the album itself is a deliberate attempt to dictate a pre-ordained ‘order’ against the perceived norms for CD album (with an uninterrupted trajectory with no forced ‘side turn’ as with vinyl LPs and cassette tapes) or digitally downloaded album (which allows complete listener control in the choice and order of tracks played), the forms in which this release was made available. Additionally the order presents two voices from within the collaborative project on two, purely imagined ‘sides’ of the release, as if they were concurrent not coherent. Indeed its name is a deliberately ‘humorous’ reference to Bowie’s Low - an unusual pop precedent for the album presenting two distinct sets of repertoire. This album and wider body of work by Sleeps in Oysters seeks to undermine pre-conceived roles of voices and instruments that imply hierarchical relationships between constituent parts of song compositions. They draw on and amalgamate concepts and processes from popular music and a spectrum of electronic music and sound art, allowing the lyrical and melodic content of songs to sit amidst experimental sound worlds. A key feature of the sonic landscape is the use of ‘found sounds’, and their intricate cutting and placement to form dense collages. This approach is reflected in use of found materials to create elaborate and bespoke physical packaging for their releases. As musical artefacts, inextricably connected sonic and physical works, they question the value of physical artefacts in the post-digital musical climate. Track Listing 1.
