5000|$|After growing pressure, Congress {{established}} the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities {{before and after}} the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, a joint inquiry of the two intelligence committees, led by Goss and Senator Bob Graham. Goss and Graham made it clear that their goal was not to identify specific wrongdoing: Graham said the inquiry would not play [...] "the blame game about what went wrong from an intelligence perspective,", and Goss said, [...] "This is not a who-shall-we-hang type of investigation. It is about where are the gaps in America's defense and what do <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> type of investigation." [...] The inquiry's final report was released in December 2002 and focused entirely on the CIA and FBI's activities, including no information on the White House's activities. Ray McGovern, a 27-year veteran of the CIA and a frequent commentator on intelligence issues, believed the report showed that Goss gave [...] "clear priority to providing political protection for the president" [...] when conducting the inquiry. Goss chiefly blamed President Bill Clinton for the recent CIA failures. He confided in a reporter: [...] "The one thing I lose sleep about is thinking what could I have done better, how could I have gotten more attention on this problem sooner." [...] When asked whether he ever brought up his concerns with the administration, Goss claimed he had met three times with Clinton to discuss [...] "certain problems". The upshot? [...] "He was patient and we had an interesting conversation but it was quite clear he didn't value the intelligence community to the degree President Bush does." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sydney Morning Herald's {{environment}} editor, Peter Hannam, {{broke the}} story about CSIRO's proposed cuts to its climate research and capability on 4 February 2016, based on leaks from senior scientists in Climate science. After Hannam's story Marshall rushed to advise staff by email that, CSIRO's climate models [...] "are {{among the best in}} the world", and contributed to proving global climate change. In his email, Marshall wrote: [...] "That question has been answered, and the new question is what do <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with?" [...] The Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, UNSW Australia, Professor Andy Pitman, who is trying to secure new government funding for his climate center of excellence, described this assertion as [...] "among the most ill-informed statements I have ever heard from a senior executive." [...] Other experts rallied to vigorously challenge the underpinning logic of CSIROs proposed changes prompting Marshall to issue an official statement on 8 February alleging [...] "incorrect reporting by media". In his statement Marshall claimed that CSIRO's plans had been misrepresented and, although Marshall claimed that the CSIRO would retain the ability to support climate measurement in Australia, he nevertheless defended the decision to reduce climate change modeling and measurement to increase mitigation and adaptation: [...] "No one is saying climate change is not important, but surely mitigation, health, education, sustainable industries, and prosperity of the nation are no less important." [...] In defending his decisions, Marshall told the ABC [...] "I guess I had the realisation that the climate lobby is perhaps more powerful than the energy lobby was back in the '70s - and the politics of climate I think there's a lot of emotion in this debate", adding [...] "In fact it almost sounds more like religion than science to me" [...] Marshall later apologized for his reference to religion at the start of a subsequent Senate Estimates hearing.|$|E

Phronetic organizational research effectively provides answers to the following four value-rational questions, for specific problematics in management and organization studies: 1.
