500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what we do (what we do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The things <b>we</b> <b>do</b> (<b>things</b> we do) / Are just between me and you (oh yeah)." [...] Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's [...] "amateur-sounding tenor croon".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Araya stated {{uncertainty}} {{about the future of}} the band, and that he could not see himself continuing the career at a later age. He said once the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band would sit down and discuss its future. King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering a split: [...] "We're talking of going in the studio next February [...] and getting the next record out so if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> in a timely manner I don't see there's any reason why we can't have more than one album out." [...] Slayer, along with Trivium, Mastodon, and Amon Amarth teamed up for a European tour titled 'The Unholy Alliance: Chapter III', throughout October and November 2008. Slayer headlined the second Mayhem Festival in the summer of 2009. Slayer along with Megadeth also co-headlined Canadian Carnage, the first time they performed together in more than 15 years when they co-headlined four shows in Canada in late June 2009 with openers Machine Head and Suicide Silence.|$|E
5000|$|Holloway said in 2004 {{and again}} in 2007: “Future generations {{are going to look}} back on this chapter in our history as a time when we made the right {{decisions}} … when we cherished and protected our culture... and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>things</b> to improve and enhance our quality of life. They’re going to see this as an historic time.” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>things</b> in sections. There {{might just}} be a few bars of music, or a verse, or a {{particular}} groove, or vamp… They would all fit. You could put them one {{in front of the}} other, or arrange it in any way you wanted. It was sort of like making films I think. —Carl Wilson, 1973 ...|$|R
5000|$|Years later, in an {{interview}} published in 2001 in Fast Company magazine, Collier stated that [...] "At the ashram, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>things</b> like staying up all night and meditating, things that taught us how to focus our minds". Skills that she still applies in stressful business situations, and that [...] "drawing on those experiences has definitely helped me maintain perspective." ...|$|R
500|$|The Romanian writer {{also spent}} the Dada period issuing {{a long series}} of manifestos, which were often {{authored}} as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by [...] "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected [...] "the language of a sophisticated savage". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for [...] "compress what we think and feel", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre [...] "suited Tzara perfectly." [...] Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: [...] "Dada means nothing", adding [...] "Thought is produced in the mouth." [...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that [...] "as long as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "{{structure}}": [...] is {{rules and}} resources, the reason <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> {{because of the}} structure of how we were raised (culture, sociological and physiological). [...] Giddens (1984) explains these rules as recipes or procedures for accomplishing tasks within an organization. [...] Resources have two subsets: allocative and authoritative, which can be leveraged to accomplish desired outcomes. [...] Allocative are quantitative resources, while authoritative are qualitative.|$|E
2500|$|Dictionaries and {{scholars}} have offered {{a variety of}} definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: [...] "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" [...] and [...] "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology." [...] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 [...] "Real World of Technology" [...] lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is [...] "practice, the way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> around here." [...] The term {{is often used to}} imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole. Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as [...] "the pursuit of life by means other than life," [...] and as [...] "organized inorganic matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{anticipation}} of their full-length debut album after releasing the EP, Empire {{during the previous}} year, The Word Alive began work on Deceiver after several US tours. It was recorded during April 2010 in Ocala, Florida with producer Andrew Wade. Guitarist, Zack Hansen explained that [...] "The tracking {{was a lot of}} fun and everyone had a good time." [...] Tyler [...] "Telle" [...] Smith noted that he received a large amount of inspiration and knowledge from his friends in a small production studio in Newark Ohio. [...] Crediting Nick Johns aka [...] "Nicky Scene" [...] for the content in a majority of the album [...] "We wanted to step it up in every aspect of our songs compared to Empire. When we're heavy, it's heavier. When <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> big, they are huge! When we slow it down, it's something beautiful." ...|$|E

In May 2016, Ulrich said in an interview with Metal Forces that the album would be released in the summer of 2016, and that details for the new album would be finalized in the next month. [...] "If the record doesn't come out this year then it won't be because it’s not done... it will be because there's some sort of cosmic reason that it would be smarter to hold onto it until next year. But the record will be done this summer". Recording of the album was completed in June 2016 once the recording for the song [...] "Hardwired" [...] was finished.|$|E
