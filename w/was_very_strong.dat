5|$|Britain had {{remained}} neutral throughout the first {{stages of the}} war. Although unsympathetic to the violence and upheaval of the French Revolution, Britain's Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was unwilling {{to go to war}} alongside the absolutist monarchies of Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy had made extensive preparations for war should it occur, starting with the Spanish Armament of 1790. The French Atlantic Fleet however was in poor condition: the principal fleet base at Brest in Brittany had been the scene of a significant mutiny in 1790 and by 1791 desertion rates among French naval officers were running at more than 80%. Despite its strong republican politics and command difficulties, the fleet itself <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> having been expanded and improved during the 1780s – indeed the tax rises to pay for the French Navy {{had been one of the}} causes of the original Revolution in 1789.|$|E

25|$|The {{first great}} {{exponent}} of Italian Renaissance architecture in England was Inigo Jones (1573–1652), {{who had studied}} architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong.</b> Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the Queen's House at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at Whitehall three years later. These works, with their clean lines, and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> {{maintained}} by emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, liberal use of military's coercive powers, {{and a strong}} economy. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook re-organization {{of the armed forces}} that concentrates power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces. A tough and capable soldier, Moerdani is also a Roman Catholic, which precluded him from posing a political threat to Suharto.|$|E

25|$|According to Neville Cardus, Tyldesley {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Lancashire batsmen. Cardus agreed with Wisden that Tyldesley was exceptionally quick on his feet and therefore always seemed to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Tyldesley <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> despite his small size, with quick reflexes and great flexibility in his wrists which assisted both his strokeplay and, when fielding, his throwing. He was especially noted as a batsman for his mastery of the square cut and his fighting qualities in difficult conditions; he played many noted innings on bad wickets.|$|E

Attempts in 1941 at defiance using the V sign were closed down {{after a few weeks}} by German fines, threats and imprisonment of offenders. In June 1941 the invasion of the Soviet Union showed that Britain was no longer a target but Germany <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong.</b> The Red Cross message system that started in 1941 lifted morale. Keeping up with the international news, the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 bringing the USA into the war was a massive boost.|$|E

Since 1189 we witnessed {{in the kingdom of}} Sicily to a struggle for succession to William the Good, but in 1194 Henry VI, husband of Constance d’Hauteville (heir designated by William) came with his Forces in the kingdom of Sicily, reclaiming the crown. Passing in these lands Henry VI alleged payment of huge taxes that people would never have been able to honour. In defence of them intervened Gioacchino da Fiore, Constance’s confessor, because he knew the people there, spent almost a year in the Rende mountains before becoming Abbot of Corazzo. After the death of Henry VI occurred shortly after, Rende lived a florid period, thanks to the protection of Constance.|$|E
25|$|After her arrest, she {{was allowed}} to retire early from the LAPD; she {{was held in the}} Los Angeles County Jail. A bail hearing was not held for almost six months. Judge Robert J. Perry {{surprised}} both sides when he set the amount at $10 million in cash, well above what the defense had suggested and more than twice what prosecutors had proposed. The case against her <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> he said, and thus she might well be at risk to flee the country or obtain weapons through her husband. Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, said the judge did not understand the case well and contrasted the high figure with the $1 million set for Robert Blake and Phil Spector when they were charged with murder. Several months later, her brother claimed she was not receiving adequate treatment for an unspecified cancer while in custody, either.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 he {{presented}} his cableway in Switzerland, a country {{very interested in}} that transport owing to its geography and which was already coming to use cable cars for bulk transport, but Torres's project was dismissed, allowing certain ironic commentary from the Swiss press. In 1907, Torres constructed the first cableway suitable for the public transportation of people, in Monte Ulía in San Sebastián. The problem of safety was solved {{by means of an}} ingenious system of multiple support cables. The resulting design <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> and perfectly resisted the rupture of one of the support cables. The execution of the project was the responsibility of the Society of Engineering Studies and Works of Bilbao, which successfully constructed other cableways in Chamonix, Rio de Janeiro, and elsewhere. But it is doubtless the Spanish Aerocar in Niagara Falls in Canada which has gained the greatest fame in this area of activity, although from a scientific point of view it was not the most important. The cableway of 580 meters in length is an aerial cable car that spans the whirlpool in the Niagara Gorge on the Canadian side, constructed between 1914 and 1916, a Spanish project from beginning to end: devised by a Spaniard, constructed by a Spanish company with Spanish capital (The Niagara Spanish Aerocar Co. Limited); a bronze plaque, located on a monolith at the entrance of the access station recalls this fact: Spanish aerial ferry of the Niagara. Leonardo Quevedo Torres (18521936). It was inaugurated in tests on 15 February 1916 and was officially inaugurated on 8 August 1916, opening to the public the following day; the cableway, with small modifications, continues to run to this day, with no accidents worthy of mention, constituting a popular tourist and cinematic attraction.|$|E

500|$|According to Russian philologist and mythographer Boris Uspensky, Stari Badnjak and Mladi Božić have analogues in East Slavic tradition—Nikola's Dad and Nikola. The name Nikola is {{a popular}} {{reference}} to Saint Nicholas of Myra, whose feast falls nineteen days before Christmas, on 6 December, his [...] "dad" [...] being celebrated the day before. Nikola is portrayed in East Slavic folklore as merciful and protective towards the common people, patron of animals and agriculture, connected with riches, abundance, and fertility. Uspensky argues that this saint took on attributes of the serpentine god Volos, whose cult <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> among East Slavs before Christianization. He was the adversary of the dreadful thunder-god Perun, who is in this case reflected in Nikola's Dad.|$|E
