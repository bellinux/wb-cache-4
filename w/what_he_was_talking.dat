500|$|Baen was {{replaced}} by John J. Pierce, but the situation only worsened. [...] Pierce resigned within a year: the company was in increasing debt, and his office assistant recalls that the office appeared inefficiently run, though he commented that Pierce [...] "clearly loved {{what he did and}} knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about". [...] Pierce's replacement was Hank Stine, who took over in late 1978, though because of Galaxys irregular schedule Pierce's last issue was March–April 1979. [...] Stine managed to produce only two more issues, June–July 1979 and September–October 1979, before UPD's financial problems spelled the end. [...] Rights to the title were transferred to a new company, Galaxy Magazine, Inc., owned by Vincent McCaffrey, proprietor of Avenue Victor Hugo, a second-hand book store in Boston; UPD retained a ten percent interest in order to receive income from future sales to pay off their debts. [...] Stine had compiled two more issues, but neither ever appeared; McCaffrey, who had also launched a separate magazine, Galileo, had cash-flow problems that prevented him from distributing the magazine as he had planned. [...] One more issue did finally appear from McCaffrey, in July 1980, in a large format; it was edited by Floyd Kemske. [...] A subsequent issue, to be dated October 1980, was assembled, but never distributed.|$|E

[...] "So you believe in that garbage, too—theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability. I can make no sense of it, and I don't believe you can either, and I don't think your god Peirce knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about." ...|$|E

Everyone knows this – politicians in particular. Ray duly faxed the questions to me, but {{on the morning of}} the recording changed them. I was bewildered by this (I think a researcher let him down). I terminated the interview when I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about and went upstairs to lunch." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wirnt von Gravenberg, writing {{early in}} the thirteenth century, {{mentioned}} the Courier Game in his poem Wigalois, and expected his readers to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about. [...] Heinrich von Beringen, about a hundred years later, mentioned {{the introduction of the}} couriers as an improvement in chess. [...] Kunrat von Ammenhausen, still {{in the first half of}} the fourteenth century, told how he had once in Constance seen a game with sixteen more men than in the [...] "right chess": each side having a trull, two couriers, a counsellor, and four extra pawns. [...] He added that he had never seen the game anywhere else, in Provence, France, or Kurwalhen.|$|E
2500|$|Aaron {{surmised that}} this setting would also return the Apollo 12 {{telemetry}} to normal. When {{he made the}} recommendation to the Flight Director, [...] "Flight, try SCE to Aux", most of his mission control colleagues had no idea <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about. Both the flight director and the Capcom asked him to repeat the recommendation. Pete Conrad's response to the order was, [...] "What the hell is that?" [...] Fortunately Alan Bean {{was familiar with the}} location of the SCE switch inside the capsule, and flipped it to auxiliary. Telemetry was immediately restored, allowing the mission to continue. This earned Aaron the lasting respect of his colleagues, who declared that he was a [...] "steely-eyed missile man".|$|E
2500|$|The Byrds' version, {{released}} {{as a single}} on April 2, 1968, reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. They transformed it into a classic of the then burgeoning genre of country rock, whereas on the basement version the country music flavor {{is more of an}} undercurrent, suggested by [...] "the lilting chorus melody". Roger McGuinn felt that the song was perfect for the Byrds: [...] "It was country-ish and had that Dylan mystique where you couldn't really figure <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about, yet the lyrics nevertheless drew you in. ... I always thought it was about when Bob was laid up in Woodstock after the bike accident and sure wasn't going anywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{journalist}} David Howell {{remarked to}} Andrew Alexander that Powell had [...] "just withdrawn us from East of Suez, and received an enormous ovation because no-one understood <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about". However, the Americans were worried by Powell's speech as they wanted British military commitments in South-East Asia {{as they were}} still fighting in Vietnam. A transcript of the speech was sent to Washington and the American embassy requested to talk to Heath about the [...] "Powell doctrine". The New York Times said Powell's speech was [...] "a potential declaration of independence from American policy". During the election campaign of 1966, Powell claimed that the British government had contingency plans to send at least a token British force to Vietnam and that, under Labour, Britain [...] "has behaved perfectly clearly and perfectly recognisably as an American satellite".|$|E
2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I wanted to ask him how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us. I sat there wondering if this great and famous churchman really knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about and whether he knew anything at all about God or heaven, and if he didn't, then who in the world did?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Noble's {{style is}} {{recognized}} as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal conversation. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask {{a member of the}} audience something about him or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded {{at the end of his}} shows. His most famous example is in his Randomist tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after Live 8 near the beginning of a show in Newcastle, which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later. This relates to an earlier comment he made in his Regent's Park show, saying that his mind [...] "Tends to wander off [...] slightly", and later added that [...] " [...] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities." [...] At which point, he forgot <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} Frazier was 15 years old, {{he was working}} on a farm for a family named Bellamy. They were both white men: Mac, who was the younger of the two and more easy going, and Jim, who was a little rougher and {{somewhat}} backward. One day a little black boy of about 12 years old accidentally damaged one of the Bellamys' tractors. Jim Bellamy became so enraged he took off his belt and whipped the boy with his belt right there in the field. Joe saw the event {{and went back to the}} packing house on the farm and told his black friends what he had seen. It wasn't long before Jim Bellamy saw Joe and asked him why he told what he had witnessed. Joe then told Bellamy he didn't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about, but Bellamy didn't believe Joe and told Joe to get off the farm before he took off his belt again. Joe told him he better keep his pants up because he wasn't going to use his belt on him. Jim then analyzed Joe for a bit and eventually said [...] "Go on, get the hell outta here." [...] Joe knew from that moment it was time for him to leave Beaufort; he could only see hard times and low-rent for himself. Even his Momma could see it. She told Joe [...] "Son, if you can't get along with the white folks, then leave home because I don't want anything to happen to you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem. He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E

50|$|Blue Film {{is a very}} {{intimate}} album, but very raunchy as well. In many of his songs, the music is very smooth sounding, but with his ominous and soft voice, combined with the lyrics itself, it is very misleading as to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about.
