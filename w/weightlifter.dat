40|$|Background: Muscle dysmorphia or vigorexia is a {{disorder}} {{in which a}} person becomes obsessed with the idea {{that he or she is}} not muscular enough. Aim: To assess physical exercise, eating behaviors and the presence of muscle dysmorphia among <b>weightlifters</b> and medical students. Subjects and Methods: Cross sectional evaluation of 88 male <b>weightlifters</b> aged 27 ± 7 years and 84 male medical students aged 22 ± 1 year was made. Eating behaviors were evaluated using the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT- 40) and the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI). The perception of body image was assessed using the Graduate Hannover Scale (GHS). Results: Prevalence of muscle dysmorphia among <b>weightlifters</b> was 13. 6 %. Both groups did not differ in body dissatisfaction. Interest in appearance among <b>weightlifters</b> was significantly higher than in students and ranged significantly higher in EAT- 40 and EDI (p < 0. 001). Other sports were practiced with the same frequency by <b>weightlifters</b> and students. <b>Weightlifters</b> expended more time than students exercising to improve their appearance (p < 0. 005). Forty two percent of <b>weightlifters</b> with muscle dysmorphia displayed abuse of anabolics and 67 % used other substances to improve their performance (p < 0. 005). Conclusions: The presence of muscle dysmorphia among <b>weightlifters</b> was confirmed. They were dissatisfied with their body image and more concerned with their physical appearance than those without muscle dysmorphia and/or students. Their anabolic abuse rate was high. Our findings were similar to those reported in the international literature...|$|R

5|$|At {{a victory}} celebration in Singapore on 25 August 2008, Vivian Balakrishnan, the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, {{announced}} that Feng, Li and Wang would be {{presented with the}} Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Service Medal).

5000|$|Marshall began {{training}} in 1978. She was coached by talented <b>weightlifters</b> such as Arthur Drechsler and Mark Chasnov. Generally in the 1970s {{there were no}} local, national or international competitions for women <b>weightlifters,</b> and women's weightlifting was not seen {{so much as a}} legitimate sport but more as a [...] "freak show". She commented in Sports Illustrated in 1987 that [...] "people think women <b>weightlifters</b> are squat and muscle-bound, with all the intelligence of amoebas".|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{types of}} {{physical}} exertion undertaken by <b>weightlifters</b> and race walkers markedly differ. This difference {{should also be}} reflected in their respective diets. Objectives. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate and assess the diets of professional <b>weightlifters</b> and race walkers, along with a comparison to the diets of those students studying physical education (PE). Materials and Methods. Subjects were respectively 12 <b>weightlifters,</b> 12 race walkers and 12 physical education students whose body composition and nutrition were determined by weighing the foods that were both eaten and drunk. Results. The study groups showed body differences, which may have arisen through dietary differences. Higher calorie diets were observed for race walkers according to body mass whilst <b>weightlifters</b> showed no difference with the other groups. Dietary intakes of protein, fat, and carbohydrates were however inappropriate for all groups. Vitamin and mineral intakes in <b>weightlifters</b> and students were within tolerable limits, but the rather aggressive taking of supplements by race walkers resulted in standard/recommended consumption levels being greatly exceeded in some cases. Conclusions. The diets of the study groups of <b>weightlifters</b> and race walkers need to be corrected.
