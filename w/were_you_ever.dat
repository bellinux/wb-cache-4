500|$|I deplore {{the fact}} that East Germans were shot while trying to flee westward, but the Berlin Wall served a useful purpose. It contributed to a {{polarisation}} between the two blocs, but it also gave a certain stability to their relationship. While the Wall was standing, there was peace. Today there's hardly a place that isn't in flames. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> in East Germany? It was a wonderful country! ...|$|E

6000|$|After six hours, Dormer paced to the stern, saluted, and said--"Beg y'pardon, sir, but <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> on the Durh'm Canal?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's so. And {{they get}} slathers of money--most {{a dollar a}} day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> engaged?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Tell us {{more about}} {{yourself}} before we part. You speak such beautiful Greek--true Athenian. It is quite delightful to hear one's own accent again. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> at Athens?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gammon! I {{know where}} he is! Law bless you!--don't blush. I've been there myself a dozen times. We were talking about quod, Lady Thrum. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> in college?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps this is {{a cold-blooded}} girl!" [...] said Mrs. Easterfield to herself. [...] "But perhaps it is not!" [...] Then, {{speaking}} aloud, she said: [...] "Olive Asher, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> in love?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If it so <b>be</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> {{get into}} the Department, lad, this ain't the first dose you'll take, nor the heaviest. It's the smoke which came nigh to {{strangling}} you, and there ain't a man that answers to Ninety-four's roll-call who can't tell exactly how you feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I flatter myself," [...] he said, [...] "that before {{very long}} I shall have taught you {{to forget that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> a Cabinet Minister, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> at Eton, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> at Oxford. One does not live in those places, you know, Julien. One shrivels instead of expands.... My friend, we have dined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very clever," [...] {{said the}} Wizard, {{nodding his head}} as if pleased. [...] "I am delighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top of it. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> with a circus, brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Florence was {{the first}} to change. Bursting into tears, she said from her full heart, 'Oh, Mama, Mama! why do we meet like this? Why <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> kind to me when there was no one else, that we should meet like this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you know, my lord,' said Mrs Wititterly, {{after a long}} silence, 'I find I take so {{much more}} {{interest}} in his plays, after having been to that dear little dull house he was born in! <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> there, my lord?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Our {{hearts are}} guarded now,' said Philip, proudly. Berenger half smiled, {{as he was}} wont {{to do when he}} meant more than he could {{conveniently}} utter, and presently he asked, in the same languid, musing tone, 'Lucy, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> really affrighted?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{have been}} wickedly defrauded." [...] The reader {{was silent for a}} while, and then he said: [...] "I wonder if anybody except the choreographic {{composer}} ever knew what the story of any ballet was? <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> able to follow it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, there isn't enough swell {{to make it}} uncomfortable, yet," [...] {{asserted}} Dunham, looking {{about to}} see if there were not something he could do for her. [...] "And you may turn out a good sailor. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> at sea before?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hey! <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> {{going to}} get up?" [...] some one yelled into my drowsy brain. I roused and opened my eyes. The yellow, {{flickering}} shadows {{on the wall of}} my tent told me that the sun had long risen. I found my companions finishing breakfast. The first thing I did was to look over the dogs. Shep, the black-and-white pup, was missing.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by exactly acquainted, Sally?" [...] put in the father with a laugh; [...] "did you ever speak to or <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> in a room with her, in your life, unless it might be at a concert or a ball?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} my sister; but all good and lovely spirits are alike. Tell me, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> married?

6000|$|Reader, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> at Jamaica? If so, you {{remember}} the negresses, the oranges, Port Royal Tom--the yellow fever.

60|$|You are {{concerned}} how strange and surprising {{it would be}} in foreign parts to hear that the poor were starving in a RICH country, &c. Are you in earnest? Is Ireland the rich country you mean? Or are you insulting our poverty? <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> out of Ireland? Or <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> in it till of late? You may probably have a good employment, and are saving all you can to purchase a good estate in England. But by talking so familiarly of one hundred and ten thousand pounds, by a tax upon a few commodities, it is plain you are either naturally or affectedly ignorant of our present condition: or else you would know and allow, that such a sum is not to be raised here, without a general excise; since, in proportion to our wealth, we pay already in taxes more than England ever did in the height of the war. And when you have brought over your corn, who will be the buyers? Most certainly not the poor, who {{will not be able to}} purchase the twentieth part of it.|$|E
