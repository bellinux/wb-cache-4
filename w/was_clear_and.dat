5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 San Francisco Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 2002 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, California. The weather <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> unseasonably warm for San Francisco in late December, but {{the field was}} soggy after several days of rain. In the first seven minutes of the game, Air Force scored 10consecutive points to take an early 10–0 lead. The Tech defense {{eventually}} clamped down on the Falcons' offense, however, and only allowed three points {{for the remainder of}} the game. The Virginia Tech offense slowly climbed back from the initial 10-point deficit, scoring a touchdown in the first quarter and a field goal in the second. By halftime, the Hokies had equalized the score at 10–10.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

5|$|On December 31, {{the weather}} <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> warm {{at the start}} of the game, though a light rain began to fall in the fourth quarter. Virginia Tech scored first, taking a 70 lead at the end of the first quarter—its only {{advantage}} in the game. In the second quarter, Nebraska scored three times for 17 points, taking a 177 lead before Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller threw a touchdown pass with 19 seconds remaining in the first half, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714. In the third quarter, the two teams alternated scores, with Nebraska maintaining a three or 10-point lead throughout. At the end of the third quarter, Nebraska had a 3121 lead. In the final quarter of the game, Nebraska scored 10 unanswered points as the Cornhuskers used their large number of backup players to advantage. The final score was 4121, Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|The morning weather <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> sunny, making ideal flying conditions. At his {{headquarters}} in Brussels, Albert Kesselring commanding Luftflotte 2 (Air Fleet 2) directed the Geschwader (wings) {{under his command}} to carry out attacks on Biggin Hill and Kenley.KG 1 was to send 60 Heinkel He 111s from its base in Amiens to conduct a high-level attack on Biggin Hill.KG 76, based in airfields {{to the north of}} Paris, was to attack RAF Kenley. The Kampfgeschwader (bomber wing) could muster 48 Dornier Do 17s and Junkers Ju 88s. The force attacking Kenley was smaller numerically than the one hitting Biggin Hill and the Ju 88 and Do 17 carried only two-thirds the bomb-load of a He 111. The planners reasoned that a more accurate low-level strike carried out by a staffel from KG 76 would compensate for the weaker firepower of KG 76s main formations. Fighter escort was provided by Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3), Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26), Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51), Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52), Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54) and Zerstörergeschwader 26 (ZG 26). The Jagdgeschwader would carry out free-hunting and close escort from bases in the Pas-de-Calais.|$|E

25|$|Titanics {{sea trials}} began at 6a.m. on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, {{just two days}} after her fitting out was {{finished}} and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.

No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on Titanic sea trials, Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators, and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked, and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.|$|E
25|$|In March 1911, Captain Ritchie {{returned}} to the Chilco with his crew and began the salvage operations and temporary repairs that were necessary {{to get her back}} to Quesnel where she could be properly made ready for the season.

Upon entering the head of the Cottonwood Canyon, he saw that the foot of the canyon was blocked solid with ice. The Chilco was rapidly speeding towards the deadly obstacle and {{it was too late to}} turn back. Fortunately, the captain and the crew escaped to the shore on the lifeboat and there were no injuries or loss of life. (Other reports were made in the local paper, then the Fort George Herald, that the escape was made onto the ice). Nonetheless, the end result was the same, the crew survived, but the Chilco did not. She was torn apart in the icy waters and not one piece of her was ever recovered.|$|E
