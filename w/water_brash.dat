40|$|The {{microwave}} radiative and backscatter {{characteristics of}} sea ice in an Arctic marginal ice zone {{have been studied}} using near-simultaneous passive and active synthetic aperture radar microwave data. Intermediate-resolution multichannel passive microwave data were registered and analyzed. Passive and active microwave data generally complement each other as the two sensors are especially sensitive to different physical properties of the sea ice. In the inner pack, undeformed first-year ice is observed to have low backscatter values but high brightness temperatures while multiyear ice has generally high backscatter values and low brightness temperatures. However, in the marginal ice zone, the signature and backscatter for multiyear ice are considerably different and closer to those of first-year ice. Some floes identified by photography as snow-covered thick ice have backscatter {{similar to that of}} new ice or open <b>water</b> while <b>brash</b> ice has backscatter similar to or higher than that of ridged ice...|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of Brasher {{is served by}} Brasher Falls Central School District, also known as [...] "St. Lawrence Central". Most of the town's electricity is supplied by National Grid with an area in the Northwest portion served by Massena Electric. Brasher Falls and the neighboring hamlet of Winthrop have a municipal sewer system. A study of the feasibility of municipal <b>water</b> in <b>Brasher</b> Falls- Winthrop area has stirred controversy. Contaminated wells in the area has generated interest, however many residents have suitable wells and do not favor the added expense. The hamlet of Helena has a municipal water system, necessitated by ground water contamination rendering the area's well water unsuitable. Landline telephone and internet service is provided by: Verizon, Nicholville Telephone Company, SLIC and Time-Warner; with wireless service provided by Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Enbridge supplies natural gas to the Brasher Falls- Winthrop area.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} system consisting of <b>water</b> covered by <b>brash</b> ice {{and a body}} freely floating near equilibrium is considered. The water occupies a half-space into which an infinitely long surface-piercing cylinder is immersed, thus allowing us to study two-dimensional modes of the coupled motion which {{is assumed to be}} of small amplitude. The corresponding linear setting for time-harmonic oscillations reduces to a spectral problem whose parameter is the frequency. A constant that characterises the brash ice divides the set of frequencies into two subsets and the results obtained for each of these subsets are essentially different. For frequencies belonging to a finite interval adjacent to zero, the total energy of motion is finite and the equipartition of energy holds for the whole system. For every frequency from this interval, a family of motionless bodies trapping waves is constructed by virtue of the semi-inverse procedure. For sufficiently large frequencies outside of this interval, all solutions of finite energy are trivial. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1503. 0219...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{retrospectively}} evaluate the radiologic findings in young adults with dysphagia undergoing barium swallow and to compare these with the final clinical diagnosis. Clinical history, barium swallow, endoscopy (21 patients), manometry (18 patients), 24 h pH monitoring (4 patients), and outcome of treatments were studied and compared in 43 patients aged 14 - 30 years (mean 24 years). There were 26 men and 17 women. Duration of symptoms varied between 2 weeks and 22 years and included globus (n = 22), obstruction (n = 31), <b>water</b> <b>brash</b> (n = 6), classic reflux symptoms (n = 10), atypical reflux symptoms (n = 9), slow eating (n = 6), and vomiting (n = 11). The final diagnosis was achalasia (n = 2), arteria lusoria (n = 1), esophagitis (n = 1), esophageal dysfunction (n = 11), esophageal stricture (n = 5), gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 8), and pharyngeal dysfunction (n = 2). Thirteen patients were assessed to be normal. The result of the barium swallow was in agreement with the final diagnosis in all but 3 patients who were assessed as normal, and the final diagnosis was esophagitis (n = 1), dysmotility (n = 1), and reflux disease (n = 1). Anatomic and functional abnormalities are common in young adults with dysphagia. Barium swallow reveals the explanation of the symptoms in 70 % of such patients. Radiology therefore should be the method of choice for the investigation of dysphagic young adults...|$|E
40|$|Drainage of peatlands {{has been}} part of {{forestry}} practice since the early 20 th century. In Ireland and the UK, approximately 800, 000 ha of peat catchments were drained and afforested between the 1950 s and 1990 s. A large number of these forests are now approaching maturity and the rate of forest harvesting will undergo a rapid increase in the near future. Nutrient release following harvesting of upland blanket peat forests in western Ireland has become a significant environmental concern, as these forests drain into ecologically valuable, oligotrophic, salmonid rivers. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the mechanisms of release and transport of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from harvested peatland forests and the effectiveness of various mitigation methods to decrease nutrient export from them. A litterbag study was used to investigate the decomposition and P and N release dynamics of harvest residue needles on different peat sites and a laboratory incubation study assessed the mobilization of P and N from peat due to a rise in water table. Laboratory flume and mini-catchment experiments investigated the effect of harvest residue brash windrows on nutrient export from harvested blanket peatlands and nutrient retention efficiency of blanket peatland buffer areas. The results suggest that P is easily released from decaying harvest residue needles, whereas N is mostly retained or accumulated during the initial stages of decomposition. Therefore, the release of N from harvest residue needles is not a likely source of the increased N export following clear-cutting, but harvest residues may contribute to P losses. High water tables produced anoxic conditions in upper peat layers and resulted in P mobilization from moderately decomposed, nutrient-poor, Irish blanket peat and highly decomposed, nutrient-rich, Irish blanket peat. In peats from Finland, P mobilization occurred only from nutrient-poor, ombrotrophic peats, and not from nutrient-rich, minerotrophic peats. A high water table also caused higher mobilization of ammonium-N (NH 4 +-N) from nutrient-rich peats compared to nutrient-poor peats. These results suggest that water-logged conditions may cause different patterns of nutrient release from different types of peats depending on their biogeochemical characteristics. The release of P from brash windrows in blanket peat catchments is a significant source of P to receiving <b>waters.</b> Although <b>brash</b> windrows do not release N during the early stages of their decomposition, the decomposition of brash may enhance N leaching and export, probably by enhancing microbial activity and soil N mineralization below brash. The removal of harvest residues and whole-tree harvesting could be an efficient means of decreasing N and P release and transport to water courses from blanket peat catchments. Conventionally-designed buffer areas, with and without seeded grasses, may have limited effect on P retention from through-flow waters in blanket peat catchments, as frequent high flow episodes, typical in blanket peat areas, are disadvantageous for effective P retention. Alternatively, a mini-buffers method, comprising brash mats and windrows positioned perpendicular to the slope, as opposed to along the main slope, and with the strips between the brash windrows seeded with native grasses, is proposed. In contrast to conventional buffer areas, a grassed or non-grassed mini-buffers method might be a feasible means of decreasing P export to water courses from harvested blanket peat sites...|$|R
