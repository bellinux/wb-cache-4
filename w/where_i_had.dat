But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E

You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E

Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|There {{were other}} factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, {{much of it}} self-imposed.

[...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later.

Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland’s vocals swell. During {{an interview}} for The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album. When speaking of [...] "Rose Colored Glasses", she said that it had taken its toll on her, “It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen."

500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{accompanying}} {{music videos}} for [...] "Why". The original video, directed by Im Seong-gwan, premiered simultaneously {{with the release}} of the single. Its synopsis follows the lyrical content of the song, depicting Taeyeon as the protagonist who desires to escape a suffocating life to re-energize herself. The filming location was decided by Taeyeon herself to be California; the singer explained on Pops of Seoul, [...] "I wanted to choose a location <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> created wonderful memories before. When it comes to a liberal, cool, sunny and beautiful place, LA comes to mind first, and that's why." [...] Jeff Benjamin from Fuse wrote that the video [...] "showcases a new side of Taeyeon" [...] while praising the singer's [...] "fierce" [...] fashion style, notably Moschino crop tops and a flannel shirt plastered with the phrase [...] "Queen of Beers." [...] Echoing Benjamin's viewpoint, Susan Min of CJ E expressed: [...] "Taeyeon shows a side of her that we′ve never seen before [...] with condiments especially catches the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E

500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to tell Madonna that I couldn’t put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop." [...] The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.|$|E
500|$|He {{then joined}} Don Carthel's West Texas A University staff as a {{volunteer}} quarterbacks coach in 2006, commenting, [...] "About a year after I retired from playing, I decided that I {{wanted to get back}} to college, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the greatest time of my life, and to get involved with college football." [...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E
500|$|She next starred {{alongside}} Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal in Siddharth Malhotra's moderately successful family drama We Are Family, {{an official}} {{adaptation of the}} Hollywood tearjerker Stepmom (1998). Kajol {{played the role of}} Maya, a character originally played by Susan Sarandon, and which she described as [...] "a control freak", believing it [...] "is something which every woman would identify with." [...] While reviewing the film for Hindustan Times, critic Mayank Shekhar stated, [...] "The premise is stuff dry tissues are made for. Yet, the pathos here is produced not from moments, but from performances alone: a stunning Kajol's in particular. She appears superior to Susan Sarandon, I suspect." [...] New York Timess Rachel Saltz wrote, [...] "The always appealing Kajol knows how to play melodrama without being melodramatic, and her naturalism gives the movie a genuine emotional kick." [...] Her final release of the year was Toonpur Ka Super Hero, a live-action animated film, opposite Ajay Devgn. In an interview with The Express Tribune, Kajol mentioned that it was difficult to work on the film. She added, [...] "Dubbing and shooting was equally frustrating. You had to keep so many things in mind and there were a few action sequences too <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do action in front of a green space, so I was smiling, scowling, laughing– all in the wrong places!" [...] The film was a critical and commercial failure and fetched Kajol mostly negative reviews for playing a role that provided her with [...] "no scope" [...] to perform.|$|E

2500|$|The Beach Boys' {{rigorous}} performing schedule increasingly burdened Wilson, {{and following}} a panic attack {{on board a}} flight from L.A. to Houston on December 23, 1964, he stopped performing live with the group {{in an effort to}} concentrate solely on songwriting and studio production. Wilson explained in 1971: [...] "I felt I had no choice. I was run down mentally and emotionally because I was running around, jumping on jets from one city to another on one-night stands, also producing, writing, arranging, singing, planning, teaching—to the point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no peace of mind and no chance to actually sit down and think or even rest."

2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water.

Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction.

And finally, about four miles from <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?"

2500|$|Petrović needed new challenges, which Cibona and the Yugoslavian League {{could not}} offer. Across the Atlantic, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA had already used their third round pick on young Petrović in 1986. However, {{he decided to}} {{postpone}} his departure to the United States. In 1988, he signed with Real Madrid instead, for at that time a hefty sum of around US$4 million. The transfer wasn't without controversy as the Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players weren't allowed to professionally move abroad until reaching 28 years of age, while Petrović was still only 23 when he signed with the famous Madrid club. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who {{played a key role}} in Petrović's summer 1988 transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from this transaction: [...] "I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen's coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it'll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to pay up in order to circumvent this law".|$|E
2500|$|A local admirer {{arranged}} {{for her to}} go to Nashville when she was 14 to audition for Capitol Records. In 1996, Capitol Records was preparing a contract for Underwood but canceled it when company management changed. Underwood said of the event, [...] "I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing came out of it now, because I wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out." [...] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball. Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian. She chose not to pursue singing after graduation. She said, [...] "After high school, I pretty much gave up on the dream of singing. I had reached a point in my life <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be practical and prepare for my future in the 'real world'". She attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, graduating magna cum laude in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in mass communication and an emphasis in journalism. She spent part of one of her summers as a page for Oklahoma State Representative Bobby Frame. She also waited tables at a pizzeria, worked at a zoo, and at a veterinary clinic.
