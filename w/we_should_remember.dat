2500|$|In September 2009, Václav Havel, {{the first}} {{president}} of the Czech Republic, and other European politicians and thinkers wrote: [...] "First, a big power will always find or engineer a pretext to invade a neighbour whose independence it resents. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that Hitler accused the Poles of commencing hostilities in 1939, just as Stalin pinned the blame on the Finns when he invaded their country in 1940. Similarly, in the case of Georgia and Russia, the critical question is to determine which country invaded the other, rather than which soldier shot the first bullet." ...|$|E
2500|$|What I am {{concerned}} about is the trend, common among present-day Buddhist teachers, of recasting the core principles of the Buddha's teachings into largely psychological terms and then saying, [...] "This is Dhamma." [...] When this is done we may never get {{to see that the}} real purpose of the teaching, in its own framework, is not to induce [...] "healing" [...] or [...] "wholeness" [...] or [...] "self-acceptance," [...] but to propel the mind in the direction of deliverance – and to do so by attenuating, and finally extricating, all those mental factors responsible for our bondage and suffering. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that the Buddha did not teach the Dhamma as an [...] "art of living" [...] – though it includes that – but above all as a path to deliverance, a path to final liberation and enlightenment. And what the Buddha means by enlightenment is not a celebration of the limitations of the human condition, not a passive submission to our frailties, but an overcoming of those limitations by making a radical, revolutionary breakthrough to an altogether different dimension of being.|$|E
60|$|The {{retention}} of free and undeveloped gemmules {{in the same}} body from early youth to old age will appear improbable, but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> how long seeds lie dormant in the earth and buds in the bark of a tree. Their transmission {{from generation to generation}} will appear still more improbable; but here again <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that many rudimentary and useless organs have been transmitted during an indefinite number of generations. We shall presently see how well the long-continued transmission of undeveloped gemmules explains many facts.|$|E

5000|$|In {{her speech}} Lynn said: [...] "These boys gave {{their lives and}} some came home badly injured, and for some {{families}} life {{would never be the}} same. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> always <b>remember,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never forget, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> teach the children to remember." ...|$|R

"Sylvia," [...] said I, {{interrupting}} her, [...] "let me {{give you}} a little piece of wisdom from my own experience: The gnawings of ungratified curiosity are often very irritating, but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that the gnawings of gratified curiosity are frequently mangling." ...|$|E

60|$|In speculating on {{the fate}} of public {{institutions}} and the course of public affairs, it is important that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not permit our attention to be engrossed by the principles on which they are founded and the circumstances which they present, but that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> also <b>remember</b> how much depends upon the character of the individuals who are in the position to superintend or to direct them.|$|R
60|$|He dined with us, almost en famille. Amelia's cook did wonders. In the billiard-room, about midnight, Charles reopened the subject. The Count {{was really}} touched.

6000|$|This plant {{offers an}} {{anomalous}} case; it flowered profusely, yet produced very few capsules; but these contained numerous seeds. Ten capsules yielded {{an average of}} 71.9 seeds, with a maximum of 95 and a minimum of 29. Considering that this plant was illegitimate and illegitimately fertilised by its brother long-styled seedlings, the average and the maximum are so remarkably high that I cannot at all understand the case. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that the average for a legitimate plant legitimately fertilised is 93 seeds.] ...|$|E

25|$|Joule was {{proposing a}} kinetic theory of heat (he {{believed}} {{it to be}} a form of rotational, rather than translational, kinetic energy), and this required a conceptual leap: if heat was a form of molecular motion, why didn't the motion of the molecules gradually die out? Joule's ideas required one to believe that the collisions of molecules were perfectly elastic. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>remember</b> that the very existence of atoms and molecules was not widely accepted for another 50 years.|$|R
60|$|Some ladies, {{especially}} such as {{are of a}} very conscientious {{and religious}} turn of mind, are apt to imagine {{that there is something}} wrong in itself in wearing ornaments or in taking pleasure in them. But <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that God himself has ornamented every thing in nature that has not power to ornament itself. Look at the flowers, the fruits, the birds, the fields, the butterflies, the insects; see how beautiful they all are made by ornaments with which God has embellished them.|$|E

It was after the Captivity, and I know no {{authority}} for any of our rulers since the destruction assuming a higher title. Clearly a prince, eh? But, though I would whisper it to no one but you, I think our worthy friend grows a little old. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> his years, sir. A hundred and ten next Passover.

Go, fold thy flock, Mark; and do thou, weak-one, house thy charge with less uproar than is wont. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that the voice is given to man, firstly, that he may improve the blessing in thanksgivings and petitions; secondly, to communicate such gifts as may be imparted to himself, and which it is his bounden duty to attempt to impart to others; and then, thirdly, to declare his natural wants and inclinations." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the debate}} on the draft Constitution at the Federal Legislative Council on 10 July 1957, Sambanthan urged greater {{co-operation}} between the communities, reminding them that Malaya was a plural society. He told the council: We belong to a plural society, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> always <b>remember</b> that in such a society we have to recognise that psychology has its own place. It is not enough if one's own attitude towards a problem is good. It is necessary that he should see what reaction, what effect it would have on members of different communities.|$|R
2500|$|It {{is right}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> stop and <b>remember</b> the 11 Israeli athletes who so tragically lost their lives when those values came under attack in Munich 40 years ago.

5000|$|As Eihei-ji and Sōji-ji became rivals {{over the}} centuries, Eihei-ji made claims {{based on the}} fact of Dōgen's {{original}} residence there. William Bodiford of UCLA wrote: [...] "Dōgen's memory has helped keep Eihei-ji financially secure, in good repair, and filled with monks and lay pilgrims who look to Dōgen for religious inspiration. Eiheiji has become Dōgen's place, the temple where Dōgen is remembered, where Dōgen's Zen is practiced, where Dōgen's Shōbōgenzō is published, where it is read, and where one goes to learn Dōgen's Buddhism. As <b>we</b> <b>remember</b> Dōgen, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> also <b>remember</b> that remembrance is not value neutral...." ...|$|R
60|$|And whenever, in {{the prayer}} for the Church militant, we commemorate the {{faithful}} dead, and thank God for all his servants departed this life in his faith and fear, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> with honest pride that we are thanking God for our own mothers and fathers, and for those that went before them; ay, for every honest God-fearing man and woman, high or low, who ever did their duty by God and their neighbours, and left, when they died, a spot of this land somewhat better than they found it.|$|E

Thy {{gratitude}} {{is not to be}} censured; it is rather worthy of thy origin and hopes; still, Donna Violetta, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> {{how difficult it is to}} winnow the truth from the chaff of imposition and legal subtlety, and, most of all, should a judge be certain before he gives his decree, that, in confirming the claims of one applicant, he does not defeat those of another." ...|$|E
6000|$|One might fancy this {{written by}} the {{secretary}} of a board of trade in an unguarded moment; but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that the poem is dedicated to the city of London. The depreciation of the rival fabrics is exquisite; and Dryden, the most English of our poets, would not be so thoroughly English if he had not in him some fibre of la nation boutiquière. Let us now see how he succeeds in attempting to infuse science (the most obstinately prosy material) with poetry.

60|$|It is {{not enough}} that the content and the belief-feeling should coexist: it is {{necessary}} {{that there should be a}} specific relation between them, of the sort expressed by saying that the content is what is believed. If this were not obvious, it could be made plain by an argument. If the mere co-existence of the content and the belief-feeling sufficed, whenever we were having (say) a memory-feeling <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>remembering</b> any proposition which came into our minds at the same time. But this is not the case, since we may simultaneously remember one proposition and merely consider another.|$|R

5000|$|A statue commemorating Captain Newport was {{recently}} unveiled at his namesake University, CNU. The statue {{has been the}} subject of some controversy, as it depicts Newport with both hands, while it is historically documented that Newport lost one of his hands at sea.

6000|$|Lanfear {{thought for}} a moment. Then he said, in the honesty he thought best to use with her: [...] "For the most part I should say it was painful. Life is {{tolerable}} enough while it passes, but when it is past, what remains seems mostly to hurt and humiliate. I don't know why <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> so insistently the foolish things and wrong things we do, and not recall the times when we acted, without an effort, wisely and rightly." [...] He thought he had gone too far, and he hedged a little. [...] "I don't mean that we can't recall those times. We can and do, to console and encourage ourselves; but they don't recur, without our willing, as the others do." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was but a}} boy when Jimsy Duthie {{turned the}} corner of the brae for the last time, with a score of mourners behind him. While I knew him there was no Janet to run to the door {{to see if he was}} coming. So {{occupied}} was Jimsy with the great affair of his life, which was brewing for thirty years, that his neighbours saw how he missed his sister better than he realized it himself. Only his hat was no longer carefully brushed, and his coat hung awry, and there was sometimes little reason why he should go home to dinner. It is for the sake of Janet who adored him that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> Jimsy in the days before she died.|$|E

"My friends," [...] said he, [...] "we {{are going}} on deck {{to find out whether}} or not we have reached the open polar sea, but we must not be excited, and we must not jump to hurried conclusions; we may have found what we are in search of, and we may not have found it yet. But we will go up and look out upon the polar world {{as far as we can}} see it, and we shall not decide upon this thing or that until we have {{thoroughly}} studied the whole situation. The engines are stopped, and every one may go up, but I advise you all to put on your warmest clothes. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> our experience at Lake Shiver." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{statement}} in the Lok Sabha on 31 March 1955 as published in Hindustan Times New Delhi on Ist April, 1955, Pandit Nehru said, [...] "Kashmir {{is perhaps the most}} difficult of all these problems between India and Pakistan. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>remember</b> that Kashmir is not a thing to be bandied between India and Pakistan but it has a soul of its own and an individuality of its own. Nothing can be done without the goodwill and consent of the people of Kashmir." [...] There was also a White Paper on Kashmir published by Indian government regarding plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|I {{remember}} saying to Ashley Hutchings, bassist after a gig, that I {{was kind of}} embarrassed about doing the material we were doing, because it seemed that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have outgrown doing covers - {{even though it was}} only 1967 - it somehow wasn't good enough and other bands were writing their own stuff and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> too. I <b>remember</b> being angry and saying to Ashley this isn't good enough, we've got to get some original material... and stuff started to trickle through.|$|R
30|$|On the {{adjustment}} measures, {{in addition to}} a strong commitment to income policies, great importance was placed on a restrictive monetary policy stance and on fighting inflation. This economic strategy was generally perceived to be the appropriate one at that time, following the second oil shock. As for the structural reform package, during those years a multitude of measures were conducted, like the industrial and energy restructuring, transformation of public enterprises, etc. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>remember</b> that the Spanish labor market approached the way a genuine market is supposed to function essentially from the break proposed onwards, right after trade unions were legalized in 1977, and the emergence of Workers’ Statute in 1980.|$|R
