500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman {{to step forward and}} end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well, so <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> continue to try to prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E
2500|$|Wilfried Martens (CD) {{criticized the}} French-speaking {{side of the}} country for misinterpreting a [...] "sign of goodwill" [...] made by Leterme. Karel de Gucht (Open VLD) said {{that they do not have}} a veto right about which Fleming can become prime minister. He also added that they overreacted. [...] "Who takes away his {{position}} as prime minister, turns him into a political martyr. I do not feel like competing against a political martyr during the next election. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> not be allowed to speak? The campaign waged against him...is unacceptable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macdonell insisted to {{his fellow}} reporters that [...] "the toughest {{decision}} for a sports writer to make {{was the one that}} would take him off his beat." [...] Explaining his love for sports writing, Macdonell once asked and answered this question while interviewing Hank Greenberg: [...] "When millionaires retire what do they do? [...] They go to big golf tournaments, visit Florida baseball camps, attend big prize fights and watch Davis Cup matches at Forest Hills. It is their idea of paradise, the ideal existence. A sports writer is even closer to the fun than an ordinary spectator. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> give up all that if his health is OK?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The electors are now {{asked to}} return a gentleman to Parliament who is rightly {{considered}} unfit for the public service, who was, in fact, if not in name, dismissed for conduct {{for which there is}} no excuse. He is quite competent to be a member of the House, but incompetent to sit on the Magistrate's Bench! Is Parliament become a refuge for the destitute? Is the Insolvency Court a half-way house to the Legislature? Does a long experience of questionable company tend to qualify a man to represent a large constituency in Parliament? Mr Fitzgerald is well known to every one in Hokitika and on the Coast. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> show his contempt for this constituency by offering them his services? ...|$|E
2500|$|When Michael Carroll {{wrote an}} e-book novella about Rico in 2014, {{he dealt with}} this issue in the story. In an {{interview}} with Irish Comic News he explained: [...] "My argument {{has always been that}} Rico’s badge should show his surname… like every other Street Judge in Mega-City One. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> be the only one to have his first name on his badge? ... But Gordon’s story “Judgement” makes a plot-point of Rico temporarily wearing a “Dredd” badge in order to fool Judge Kenner into thinking that he is Joe … So I had to make a choice. In my re-telling of the relevant scenes from “Judgement” I omitted the part about the badge-swap. So far, no one has complained!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A few {{critics were}} less than {{impressed}} by King's victory; she was 26 years younger, and some experts claimed {{that it was more}} an age versus youth game. According to Jack Kramer, [...] "I don't think Billie Jean played all that well. She hit a lot of short balls which Bobby could have taken advantage of had he been in shape. I would never take anything away from Billie Jean—because she was smart enough to prepare herself properly—but it might have been different if Riggs hadn't kept running around. It was more than one woman who took care of Bobby Riggs in Houston." [...] Before the match, however, King had forced the American television network ABC to drop Kramer as a commentator. King said, [...] "He doesn't believe in women's tennis. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> be part of this match? He doesn't believe in half of the match. I'm not playing. Either he goes—or I go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No you won't, father. And <b>why</b> <b>should</b> you? <b>He</b> {{has done}} nothing wrong to you or me. I wouldn't have him if it was ever so." ...|$|R

5000|$|God indeed favors none but the elect {{alone with}} the Spirit of regeneration, and that by this they are {{distinguished}} from the reprobate… But I cannot admit that all this is any reason <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not grant the reprobate also some taste of his grace, <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not irradiate their minds with some sparks of his light, <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not give them some perception of his goodness, and in some sort engrave his word on their hearts.|$|R
2500|$|The title {{refers to}} a passage {{about the end of}} the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, {{beginning}} with the words [...] "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour" [...] (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: [...] "Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>He</b> hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?" [...] Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block says: [...] "Faith is a torment – did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." [...] Bragg notes that the concept of the [...] "Silence of God" [...] in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. Interestingly, in Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as A Painting on Wood, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, [...] "mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void." ...|$|E
2500|$|A year later, Hashizume's boss aids him {{in opening}} his own restaurant, which he names [...] "Ida." [...] Kobayashi is {{accepted}} into the same college that Toyo is attending, and Toyo has passed the government test {{to work in the}} Ministry of Finance. Naru is continuing to get past her rejection. As more time passes, Hashizume's restaurant grows popular and he hires a single female assistant, Kaori. Ida grows uneasy about his being close to a beautiful woman until Hashizume points out that they are both gay, so <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> care. To ease Ida's mind further, he tells Kaori about him, which does not bother her at all. Two years after Toyo begins working at the Ministry of Finance, Kobayashi is now teaching world history at his old high school alongside Ida. After his supervisor asks him about his box lunches, Toyo demands Kobayashi stop making them out of fear someone will find out that he is gay. Work becomes so busy Toyo does not have time to call Kobayashi for forty days. When he finally has a free day coming up, he confesses to his supervisor that his [...] "girlfriend" [...] is a [...] "boyfriend", then goes to Kobayashi. After they make love, he tells Kobayashi he may quit. Kobayashi tells him he told his students on the first day that he was gay, and says that they cannot fire him from a public job just because he is homosexual. The next working day, Toyo asks his supervisor to [...] "gracefully and tactfully" [...] let people know he is gay. At the end of the series, Ida and Hashizume go to visit Ida's parents to [...] "come out" [...] to them. Kobayashi has already told his parents, and Naru promises to be Toyo's supporter when he's ready.|$|E

60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>should</b> not <b>he</b> too receive consolation? Was {{his soul}} not as worth saving as theirs? A last spark of hope filled him, and he lifted {{himself up on}} tip-toe to touch the feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{think it}} over, Surajah. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> have hesitated, and <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> {{have turned the}} {{question}} off without answering it, unless {{there had been some}} reason? And if so, what could the reason be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should he}} come if he doesn't like you? He is under no obligation, {{and he has}} his ship to look after. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> sit for an hour at a time, and <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> be so pleasant?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Godfrey woke up {{shaking with}} fear, wet with perspiration, and {{reflected}} earnestly on his latter end, {{which seemed to}} be at hand. If that great, burly, raucous-voiced Sims had died so suddenly, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> not <b>he,</b> Godfrey? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed! <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> I? <b>He</b> {{would be}} more often at the House, and keep later hours, and be always away all the morning into the bargain. But I shall like him to do as he likes himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clara rose too, {{with the}} patient {{acquiescence}} of a woman, and took his hand proffered in parting.

6000|$|He {{introduces}} {{him first}} to his hearers as 'Theodoric, known in German song as Dietrich of Bern.' He had spoken before of the Visi-Gothic Theodoric, and of him he never speaks as Dietrich. Then, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> have adopted this High-German {{name for the}} great Theodoric, and <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> speak of Attila too as Etzel? ...|$|E

6000|$|This {{sentiment}} communicates new {{impulse to}} Mrs. Sliverstone, who launches into new praises of Mr. Sliverstone’s worth and excellence, {{to which he}} listens in the same meek silence, save when he puts in a word of self-denial relative to some question of fact, as—‘Not seventy-two christenings that week, my dear. Only seventy-one, only seventy-one.’ At length his lady has quite concluded, and then he says, <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> repine, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> give way, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> suffer his heart to sink within him? Is it he alone who toils and suffers? What has she gone through, he should like to know? What does she go through every day for him and for society? ...|$|E

6000|$|The only {{immediate}} conclusion {{at which}} he resolved was this, that it was unnecessary that he should say anything to Mary {{on the subject of}} her ladyship's visit.
