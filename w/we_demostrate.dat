In order to demonstrate that this is possible, we need to investigate the reactions that take place in the PTR-MS with ethylene. New PTR-MS instruments allow to choose between the three primary ions H 3 O+, O 2 + and NO+ [1], hence the name Selective Reagent Ion - Mass Spectrometry (SRI-MS). Moreover, O 2 + and NO+ are the ions typically encountered in H 3 O+ mode and can act as parasitic, precursor ions [2, 3]. We performed extensive calibrations using ethylene external standards at different instrumental conditions and showed {{that it is possible to}} accurately predict ethylene concentrations by considering ethylene reaction with O 2 + ions, which are found to proceed at about collision rate. We also showed that NO+ ions do not react with ethylene while for H 3 O+ ions the reation proceeds much below collision rate.

The problem is important since temperature governs {{a variety of}} the geological processes including formation of magmas, minerals, fosil fuels and also deformation of rocks. Mathematical this problem is formulated as a Cauchy problem for an non-linear elliptic equation and since the thermal properties of the rocks depend strongly on the temperature, the problem is non-linear.
