Her husband found her <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched {{and the other half}} is found there.|$|E
25|$|Every time <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to Palampur on leave, {{he would}} visit the Neugal Cafe. Batra last came home {{on leave from}} the army in 1999, during the Holi festival for a few days. During that time, {{when he went to}} the Café for a coffee, he met an {{acquaintance}} who told him to be careful in the war, to which Batra replied: I'll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it. But I'll come for sure.|$|E

25|$|Poirot {{travels with}} Diana {{to the family}} seat of Lyde Manor where he meets the people involved. Hugh strikes Poirot as a fine young bull of a man. He learns further details {{of the history of}} {{insanity}} in the family from Colonel Frobisher, including Hugh's grandfather who was committed to an asylum. Poirot learns that Hugh's mother died when he was ten years old in a boating accident when she was out with the Admiral, and that she was previously engaged to Frobisher before he went off to India with the British Army. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> he learned she had married Admiral Chandler, however this incident did nothing to lessen the ties of friendship between the two men. Poirot forces Frobisher to tell him more details of the incident with the sheep and finds out that on the night concerned, the Admiral found his son in bed with blood on his clothes and blood in the washbasin but Hugh remembered nothing of what he had done. Poirot questions the Admiral who has aged immensely since these incidents started and who feels that breaking the engagement is best for everyone, remarking {{that there will be no}} more Chandlers at Lyde Manor after he and his son have died.|$|E
25|$|Hoad won {{his first}} Italian Championships on the clay courts of the Foro Italico in Rome in early May when he outplayed Sven Davidson in {{straight}} sets. At the French Championships Hoad survived a five-set scare against Robert Abdesselam {{in the third round}} to reach the final which he won against Sven Davidson in straight sets to claim his second consecutive title at a Grand Slam event. Unknown to the public Hoad had stayed up the night previous to the final, invited by a Russian diplomat, and was drunk <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home.</b> An intensive workout by Rod Laver got him into a state that allowed him to play the final. In May Hoad won the International Golden Ball tournament in Wiesbaden, West Germany after a straight-sets victory in the final over Art Larsen but in the Trofeo Conde de Godó in Barcelona he lost in the quarterfinal to Bob Howe. As a preparation for Wimbledon Hoad elected to play the singles event at the Northern Championships in Manchester instead of the Queen's Club Championships. He reached the final but had to bow for 34-year old Jaroslav Drobný who won the deciding set 7–5. Hoad was seeded first for the Wimbledon Championships and was the pre-tournament favorite. He lost two sets along the way to reach the final, in which he faced Rosewall. In the first all-Australian final since 1922 Hoad was victorious in four sets to gain his first Wimbledon and third successive Grand Slam championship title. Hoad also won the doubles title with Rosewall, their third Wimbledon title, outclassing Orlando Sirola and Nicola Pietrangeli in the final in straight sets. Following his Wimbledon title he entered the Midlands tournament and was beaten in the semifinal by Mike Davies. In August Hoad won the singles title at the German Championships, held on the clay courts at Hamburg, after a four-set defeat of Orlando Sirola in the final.|$|E

The couple had no {{children}} and lived in Los Angeles. Kathryn stayed at home when Slayer toured; Hanneman claimed to prefer this, having said that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> she was [...] "all brand new again."

500|$|Crumb {{denied any}} {{personal}} {{attachment to the}} character, stating, [...] "I just got into drawing him... He was fun to draw." [...] As Crumb's personal life changed, Fritz would too. According to Pahls, [...] "For years, [...] had few friends and no sex life; {{he was forced to}} spend many hours at school or on the job, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> he 'escaped' by drawing home-made comics. When he suddenly found a group of friends that would accept him for himself, as he did in Cleveland in 1964, the 'compensation' factor went out of his drawing, and this was pretty much the end of Fritz's impetus." ...|$|E
500|$|Jerry Alan West {{was born}} into a poor {{household}} in Chelyan, West Virginia. He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician. [...] West was a shy, introverted boy, who became even more withdrawn when his closest brother David died in the Korean War at age 22 when Jerry was 12. He was so small and frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent him from getting seriously hurt. Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother's whippings <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> hours late for dinner; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as [...] "obsessive".|$|E
500|$|In 1965, {{she opened}} the front door of Kenwood to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp", but with her husband's features. He {{explained}} that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> telling {{her for the first time}} that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, [...] "Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me".|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{the bearer}} of {{important}} news," [...] he announced. [...] "Dispatches from the front. You’ll hear all about it from your father <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home,</b> but I {{wanted to be the}} first with it." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E
2500|$|When he was young, the Kojima {{family moved}} to a small city called Shirasaki. His family soon moved to Kawanishi, Hyōgo in the Kansai region. Kojima has noted that growing up he was a {{latchkey}} kid, often having to look after himself <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> from school. Staying at home by himself in isolation still affects him to this day stating, [...] " [...] I travel and stay at a hotel I put the TV on as soon as I enter the room, just {{to deal with the}} feeling of loneliness." ...|$|E
2500|$|One child's mother {{reported}} the incident to Penn State police <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> {{with his hair}} wet. [...] After an investigation by Detective Ronald Shreffler, Centre County District Attorney Ray Gricar chose not to prosecute. Shreffler testified {{before the grand jury}} that director of the campus police, Thomas Harmon, told him to drop the case. [...] University police eavesdropped on conversations during which the mother confronted Sandusky about the incident.
