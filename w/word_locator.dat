40|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading assessment, a new subset of items will be {{introduced}} {{with the intent of}} measuring vocabulary in context. The assessment's item format requires an examinee to locate a targeted word in the reading passage. It was reasoned that presenting these items along with - <b>word</b> <b>locator</b> cues' might help reduce construct irrelevant variance due to students' differential ability in searching the targeted word. Using a sample of 1323 fourth and eight grade students, this study investigated the effects of two such - <b>word</b> <b>locator</b> cues' on student performance: numbering the lines of the passage, and printing targeted words in boldface type. The results indicated that various format conditions (with and without cues) do not influence student performance on the vocabulary items after controlling for reading comprehension. On the other hand, at both fourth and eighth grade, we detected interactions between format conditions and race/ethnicity, which suggested that <b>word</b> <b>locator</b> cues appear to hurt the performance of certain subgroups. Implications of these findings for NAEP's future reading assessments are discussed...|$|E

5000|$|The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP or Loc/ID split) [...] {{has been}} {{proposed}} by IETF {{as a solution to}} issues as the scalability of the routing system. LISP main argument is that the semantics of the IP address are overloaded being to be both locator and identiÔ¨Åer of an endpoint. LISP proposes to address this issue by separating the IP address into a locator part, which is hierarchical, and an identifier, which is flat. However this is a false distinction: in Computer Science it is impossible to locate something without identifying it and to identify something without locating it, since all the names are using for locating an object within a context. Moreover, LISP continues to use the locator for routing, therefore routes are computed between locators (inter- faces). However, a path does not end on a locator but on an identifier, in other <b>words,</b> the <b>locator</b> is not the ultimate destination of the packet but a point on the path to the ultimate destination. This issue leads to path-discovery problems, as documented by [...] whose solution is known not to scale.|$|R
