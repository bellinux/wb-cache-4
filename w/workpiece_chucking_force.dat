40|$|DE 19830962 A UPAB: 20000228 NOVELTY - The bending device has a {{stationary}} <b>workpiece</b> <b>chuck</b> for holding a {{first section of}} the rod-shaped workpiece and a relatively displaced bending organ (4) for securing a second section of the workpiece. The bending organ has 3 translatory and 3 rotary degrees of movement, e. g. using 6 variable length struts (5) between the bending organ and the machine frame (6). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a rod-shaped workpiece bending method is also included. USE - The bending device is used for rod-shaped workpieces, e. g. bars or pipes.

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{precision}} ring shaped parts using the turning process depends significantly on the workholding characteristics. Workholding parameters such {{as the number of}} jaws and <b>chucking</b> <b>force</b> are known to influence the roundness tolerance of ring shaped parts commonly used in bearing applications. Experimental trial and error methods are often used in practice to optimize the workholding parameters to achieve the desired part quality. This thesis develops a systematic mathematical approach for optimizing these parameters using a finished cut roundness prediction model and a model for determining the reaction <b>force</b> between the <b>chuck</b> jaws and the ring. The roundness prediction model is verified through experiments for different cutting conditions. The optimization approach takes as input the required roundness tolerance, geometry and mechanical properties of the ring, cutting forces, and the coefficient of friction between the jaws and the ring. The output consists of the minimum number of jaws and the range of acceptable <b>chucking</b> <b>forces</b> that satisfy the required tolerance while preventing slip of the ring. Simulation examples are used to illustrate the proposed workholding optimization approach for a hard turning application. In addition, based on the optimization model, the thesis proposes a novel concept of dynamic <b>chucking</b> <b>force</b> control that promises to yield part roundness that is superior to conventional chucking.

40|$|Tool {{wear and}} tool {{breakage}} recognition is based {{as a rule}} on previously "learnt" signal patterns {{when it comes to}} monitoring the machining process of machine tools. This is necessary as the vibrations of the tool may superimpose on the cutting characteristics to an extent that an evaluation without any pattern becomes incertain or even impossible. Morever, interfering factors such as variations in the material charges, blank-shape faults or material defects often cause an unjustified response of the monitoring systems and false interpretations. The paper presents a surveillance system capable of evaluating the signals coming from the strain gauges in the turning chuck jaws not only for monitoring the <b>chucking</b> <b>force</b> but also for detecting the cutting force during the cutting process. The information contained in the <b>chucking</b> <b>force</b> signal can hence be used successfully both for the determination of the cutting force and for tool breakage recognition...|$|R

The clamping <b>force</b> of <b>chucks</b> {{can be measured}} with wire strain gauges during the machining operation. In order to determine suitable measuring points, the deformation behaviour of base jaw and top jaw was examined with the finite element method.

40|$|High {{precision}} electrostatic chucks with diameters up to {{12 inches}} {{are being developed}} at IOF for electron/ion-beam lithography applications. For optimal performance, selection of the appropriate chuck dielectric is crucial. We have tested various materials, including sapphire, quartz and glass-ceramics with respect to <b>chucking</b> <b>force</b> under vacuum conditions. Differences in electrostatic force of more than {{an order of magnitude}} were observed and are attributed to Coulomb and Johnsen-Rahbek behaviour. For the former, reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations was obtained when taking the corresponding dielectric constants and a finite gap between wafer and support into account.

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the performance of CNC machine tools due to the active research over the last several decades. However, the research and understanding on chucking accuracy have not been adequate. Nor has any systematic methods been reported for on chucking accuracy, especially in terms of the repeatability and the accuracy in the position of a <b>chucked</b> <b>workpiece.</b> The needs for the improvements in chucking accuracy has been existed since chucking has been the bottleneck in the form accuracy of a workpiece as the accuracy of machine tools improved significantly over the last several decades. However, the need was not very strong since turning has not been considered as the finishing process for the production of precision mechanical components such as bearings and shafts. After recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of hard turning in terms of surface integrity over other abrasive machining processes as a finishing process, a strong need emerged to improve chucking accuracy to enable the implementation of finish hard turning for the production of precision mechanical components. In this study, systematic methods for improving the accuracy and repeatability in the position of a <b>chucked</b> <b>workpiece</b> have been sought. Factors affecting the positioning accuracy and repeatability of a <b>chucked</b> <b>workpiece</b> have been identified. In addition, the characteristics of these factors, as well as their effect on chucking accuracy, were given. From the results, a chucking error map that summarizes the relations between these factors and the positioning erro...|$|R

40|$|For {{advanced}} lithography applications, high-precision electrostatic chucks with diameters up to 12 inch {{are being}} developed at IOF. Although electrostatic chucking is mostly used in vacuum, the principle also works under ambient conditions. However, forces exerted on the wafer {{may not be the}} same in both cases. To quantify the influence of environmental conditions, electrostatic <b>forces</b> for various <b>chuck</b> dielectrics were measured under ambient conditions (humid air), dry nitrogen and in vacuum. The forces are found to be significantly reduced at ambient conditions as compared to the vacuum case. When flushing with dry nitrogen, the vacuum level is essentially retained. Clearly, water at the chuck-to-wafer interface reduces the <b>chucking</b> <b>force.</b> We suspect that dissociation of water occurs, entailing ionic charge transport and trapping in the dielectric. This eventually shields the wafer from the chuck electrode...|$|R

By June 2012, much of the first film's supporting cast was confirmed to return, including Idris Elba, Jaimie Alexander, Ray Stevenson and Stellan Skarsgård. Also in June, Joshua Dallas announced {{that he would not be}} reprising the role of Fandral. Dallas had initially intended to return, but had to bow out due to his commitment on the television show, Once Upon a Time, and Zachary Levi was cast in his place.

50|$|A {{cylindrical}} grinder has {{a grinding}} (abrasive) wheel, two centers {{that hold the}} <b>workpiece,</b> and a <b>chuck,</b> grinding dog, or other mechanism to drive the work.

The wheel and workpiece move parallel to one another in both the radial and longitudinal directions. The abrasive wheel can have many shapes. Standard disk-shaped wheels can be used to create a tapered or straight workpiece geometry while formed wheels are used to create a shaped workpiece. The process using a formed wheel creates less vibration than using a regular disk-shaped wheel.|$|R
