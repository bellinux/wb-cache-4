Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E

[...] The director Mike Newell has said: [...] "There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy."

500|$|Homework success brought {{worldwide}} {{attention to}} French progressive house music, and {{drew attention to}} French house music. According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Euro dance formula. In the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, critic Alex Rayner stated that Homework tied the established club styles to the [...] "burgeoning eclecticism" [...] of big beat. He contended that it served as a proof that [...] "there was more to dance music than pills and keyboard presets." [...] Clash described Homework as an entry point of accessibility for a [...] "burgeoning movement {{on the cusp of}} splitting the mainstream seam." [...] In 2009, Brian Linder of IGN described Homework as the duo's third-best album. He catalogued as a [...] "groundbreaking achievement" [...] the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> their unique skills to craft the house, techno, acid and punk music styles into the record. Hua Hsu of eMusic agreed, applauding Homework for how it captured a [...] "feeling of discovery and exploration" [...] as a result of [...] "years of careful study of the finest house, techno, electro and hip-hop records." [...] David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, stated that the duo knew how to use [...] "their playful, hip-hopping ambient techno" [...] to craft the album. He named Homework the [...] "ideal disco for androids". Sean Cooper of AllMusic called the album [...] "an almost certain classic" [...] and [...] "essential".|$|E

May referred to the Beatles as being [...] "our bible in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> the studio and they painted pictures and this wonderful instinctive use of harmonies." [...] At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as [...] "Led Zeppelin meets Yes" [...] due to its combination of [...] "acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics".|$|E

2500|$|Philpot made further {{controversial}} comments {{after the}} 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, legalizing gay marriage throughout the United States. Philpot described gay marriage as an oxymoron, the Supreme Court's decision as [...] "pretty close to insane," [...] and described homosexual relationships as [...] "sterile" [...] and [...] "just entertainment." [...] He also described homosexuality as a choice, saying that children now have [...] "got {{to decide which}} gender to date"; this matches his previously expressed views that the gay lifestyle is a [...] "destructive lifestyle" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "behavior, it's not genetic." [...] LGBT rights advocates challenged these views as showing a [...] "fundamental misunderstanding {{of what it means to}} be LGBT" [...] and as evidence of a [...] "deep disrespect for LGBT people and their families." [...] Judges have a First Amendment right to express their views so long as they do not influence their decisions. Philpot has presided over many cases with LGBT people and lawyers who have been involved report that he does not base his decisions on a litigant's sexuality. Speaking of his religious views, Philpot has stated that [...] "I don't mention Jesus inside the courthouse very much, even when I know he is absolutely the only answer to the problem in front of me." [...] Philpot has also stated that [...] "half the adoptions I do are for gay people. And they're not bad people," [...] and that he loves homosexuals. Philpot regrets, however, that friendships between straight men are affected as they are unable to hug in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> to, and that the rainbow, a symbol from the Bible, had been [...] "stolen" [...] – and he plans to put a rainbow on the back of his car.|$|E

60|$|Maybe {{the boys}} {{nowadays}} do not throw fire-balls, or know about them. They {{were made of}} cotton rags wound tight and sewed, and then soaked in turpentine.

A boy {{had to be very}} nimble not to get burned, and a great many boys dropped the ball for every boy that threw it. I am not ready to say why these fire-balls did not set the Boy's Town on fire, and burn it down, but I know they never did. There was no law against them, and the boys were never disturbed in throwing them, any more than they were in building bonfires; and this shows, as much as anything, what a glorious town that was for boys. The <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> to build their bonfires was to set one tar-barrel on top of another, as high as the biggest boy could reach, and then drop a match into them; in a moment a dusky, smoky flame would burst from the top, and fly there like a crimson flag, while all the boys leaped and danced round it, and hurrahed for the Whig candidates. Sometimes they would tumble the blazing barrels over, and roll them up and down the street.|$|E
