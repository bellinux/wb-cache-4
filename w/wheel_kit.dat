Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The effects of three soil aerators on trunk growth, yield, nut size, and percent kernel of pecan were studied at Frio, Medina, and San Saba Counties in Texas in 1993 and 1994. A complete randomized block design was used in each location to compare three different types of soil aeration equipment to a control. The Frio County study contained six replications on four 'Wichita' trees per treatment. The Medina County study contained seven replications on three 'Wichita' trees per treatment. The San Saba County study contained six replications on two 'Western' trees per treatment. The treatments included (A) Guin Root Feeder; (B) Savage aerator; (C) Aerway aerator; and (D) control, no treatment. The Guin Root Feeder is a manually-operated pneumatic aerator which injects air 15 cm into the soil. Each treated tree received 16 injections equally spaced in a 2 m square block design. The Savage aerator has 12 crescent-shaped spikes, arranged in three rows, which slices the soil every 70. 78 cm to a depth of 40. 6 cm. The model used in this study was 2. 29 m wide. Each treated tree had three passes on two sides. The Aerway aerator has sixteen spikes, 1. 27 cm thick by 20. 3 cm in length, spaced 10. 2 cm and mounted on two spindles. The model used in this study was the 1. 7 m model with a <b>wheel</b> <b>kit.</b> Each treated tree had three passes on two sides. Treatments were applied and trunk diameters were measured in mid-May 1993 and 1994 at each location. In the fall of each year nut samples were collected from each treatment block, and nut yield was measured and analyzed for quality. Results {{of this study indicate that}} for these two years soil aeration did not increase trunk growth, nut yield, or quality. This could have been the result of a detrimental increase in water infiltration that saturated the clay soils and may have possibly destroyed roots since internal drainage was restricted. This study did continue for a third year and should give a better indication of effects of soil aeration on pecan...|$|E

40|$|In {{civilian}} applications, {{the utilization}} of quadcopters increasing quickly. Still, this deployment experiences some difficulties like flying vibration and instability which lead to inaccurate data of onboard sensors. Determining the size of such inaccuracy assists in improving the future design and provides more precise understanding of data measured in copter applications. This work introduces an implementation of a quadcopter using recently developed hardware and software components. An aerial imagery system was applied {{as a case study}} to evaluate the performance of the implemented quadcopter. The quadcopter was assembled mainly from F 450 Flame <b>Wheel</b> frame <b>kit,</b> Aurdo-Pilot Mega APM 2. 6 controller and a Mission Planner as ground station software. The picked up images were stitched and then compared with the available Google Earth images. Also, the dimensions of targeted buildings and GPS coordinates of certain points were measured on the aerial images. The accuracy of aforementioned dimensions and GPS coordinates in comparing with the actual measurements has been investigated. The clarity and measurement errors found on the taken aerial images were such acceptable that make the quadcopter usage for photogrammetry is quite possible to monitor the changes taking place on the ground such as affected areas and under construction sites.

Towards {{the end of its}} model run, Mitsubishi introduced several limited editions (based on the GLi) to remain competitive with its rivals. These extras such as sports interiors, alloy <b>wheels,</b> and body <b>kits.</b> Despite the introduction of the new generation Lancer sedan to Australia in 2002, the CE continued alongside it until production ended in 2003, including the sedan which remained as the basic GLi.

The VS joined the revised Vi, renamed the Cypha, and offered WiLL buyers the choice of a wider car with a more powerful engine. The width dimensions of the VS exceeded Japanese Government regulations that taxed vehicles based on exterior dimensions, which buyers of the VS were liable.In spite of its success in the Japanese market, where the WiLL VS had a cult following, the model was never released overseas. Production of the WiLL VS was stopped circa 2004 and a replacement model was never announced, much to the disappointment of its fans. Nevertheless, some would argue that {{there was no need to}} replace the WiLL VS for at least another decade given its futuristic design that some of the newer cars were only beginning to adopt. This would include trend-setting features such as the rakish body shape, aerodynamic angles, projector-style headlamp cluster (regarded as revolutionary in 2001), illuminated speedometer and clear LED tail lights.|$|R
