5|$|Lafayette Square is one {{of three}} squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most {{important}} space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a one-way westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection to Clinton Street).|$|E
5|$|Robin Hood Gate {{takes its}} name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn (demolished in 2001) and is close to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Robin Hood {{roundabout}} on the A3. Widened in 1907, it has been closed to motorised vehicles since a 2003 traffic reduction trial. Alterations commenced in March 2013 to make the gates more suitable for pedestrian use and return some of the hard surface to parkland.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary. Laboratory {{studies have found that}} long day illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth. The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E
50|$|In early {{particle}} physics, the 'pomeron sector' <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now <b>called</b> <b>the</b> 'closed string sector' while <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> 'reggeon sector' <b>is</b> now the 'open string theory'.|$|R

5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> thumb-rest. Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with a neck strap or a floor peg.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> dihedral position. The {{flight of the}} greater yellow-headed {{is an example of}} static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E
5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects recede from the Earth faster, in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E

5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Maldacena conjecture).|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory {{promises to be a}} unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three. In <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E

5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the player assumes {{the role of}} Yukito Kunisaki and the {{scenarios}} for the three heroines are available in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Dream story arc. After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of Ryūya. Summer is a linear novel arc in which no choices are presented to the player. Upon {{the completion of the}} Summer route, another scenario called Air is made available, which serves as the true ending to the story. In Air, the player assumes the role of a crow named Sora. In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Air without the erotic content.|$|E
5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the {{scenarios}} for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios {{are available in}} <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights {{were meant to be}} items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E
5|$|The solar {{magnetic}} field extends {{well beyond the}} Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's {{magnetic field}} into space, forming <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> interplanetary magnetic field. In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities {{on either side of}} the solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral. The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50–400μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5nT, about a hundredtimes greater. The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.|$|E
