[...] "It was a very do-it-yourself, homemade thing {{when it comes down}} to it", Erikson explained; [...] "We all pitch in. Shirley had just as many comments on the guitar parts or the sound of the guitars as anybody else, and likewise, if we don't like a lyric, <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> right away." [...] Many songs have a more optimistic view in life, inspired by Manson overcoming a desire to quit music after the death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her. Darker themes still appear as Manson described herself as [...] "enthusiastic and passionate, but I do see death marching toward me." [...] "Blood for Poppies" [...] came [...] "from a lot of things", Manson said; [...] "It's really an analogy for a story I read about Afghanistan and the opium wars over there ... it's from a few stories, one about a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan and the other about the opium wars. I use that as a backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out-of-control place." [...] " [...] remaining sane, when faced with insanity", she added. [...] "I Hate Love" [...] criticized [...] "the commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through" [...] along with [...] "knowing that there will be no more torture in your life than really, truly loving somebody who doesn't love you back." [...] Manson also incorporated some self-confidence and knowledge of her personality achieved during acting classes, in which she accepted that [...] "was never going to be the cheerleader or the beautiful, conventional girl who fits in everywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|Priya Elan of NME commented, [...] "By now it's pretty {{customary}} {{to have a}} jaw-on-the-floor {{reaction to}} the first single from a Rihanna album. 'Pon De Replay', 'SOS', 'Umbrella', 'Russian Roulette', 'Only Girl In The World'." [...] Despite complimenting Rihanna for sounding extremely relaxed and calling her vocal as [...] "luxurious calling to mind the atmosphere", Elan concluded that the over-all effect is underwhelming. She continued by writing that instead of re-inventing the pop wheel, [...] "We Found Love" [...] has [...] "a whiff of treading-water about it" [...] and that [...] "if there is a 'goosebump' moment to be had it comes after many multiple plays and, dare <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> a glass of something strong." [...] Awarding [...] "We Found Love" [...] two stars out of five, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone was critical, writing that it [...] "is much ado about very little indeed" [...] and that is [...] "an insipid tune". He concluded that Rihanna repeats 'We found love in a hopeless place' [...] "approximately 350 times, hoping it will start to mean something. It's the worst single of Rihanna’s career. It will probably top the Hot 100 anyway." [...] Leah Collins of The Vancouver Sun initially praised Rihanna's vocal performance in the song, writing that she [...] "smoothes out her vocals", before adding, [...] "Angelic as she sounds, though, [...] performance – which is mostly just her repeating the line 'We found love in a hopeless place' – seems to take second place to Harris' repetitive synth-based blare." [...] Similarly, Amos Barshad of Grantland criticized the singer's vocal performance, calling it [...] "a complete afterthought" [...] before concluding, [...] "People who regularly attend the Electric Zoo festival: Rihanna wants your money!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to make some kind of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage that I can make you feel five ways in thirteen seconds. <b>We</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> in jest, but the reality of the situation is that I am required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E
