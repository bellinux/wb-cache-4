5|$|During these {{workshops}} it {{was decided}} that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown lunch counters. At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch counters <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 a Belgian film {{adaptation}} of The Crab with the Golden Claws was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to proceed, Hergé contacted Disney Studios in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt The Adventures of Tintin for the silver screen.|$|E

25|$|The {{events were}} not always sports-related: the 30-some-thousand seats <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> venue for {{political}} rallies. In 1940, Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie came to Shibe for a speech and rally. Four years later, the man who beat Willkie, Franklin D. Roosevelt, made one of his few 1944 public appearances at 21st and Lehigh; he won again. In 1948, third-party Progressive candidate Henry A. Wallace made his nomination acceptance speech there.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} US airmail service connected Washington, D.C., and New York. This 218-mile route was {{the first}} step in establishing a transcontinental route by air. Transcontinental air service was the best opportunity for airmail to provide faster service at lower cost than the existing railroads. Routes like College Park to New York were only slightly faster than the railroad, but <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> laboratory for developing safe and reliable airmail operations.|$|E

[...] As thus put, the question admits of but one reply. But as thus put, it assumes the point at issue. We contend that, as appetite <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to all the lower creation--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the infant--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the invalid--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the differently-placed races of men--and as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide for every adult who leads a healthful life; it may safely be inferred that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide for childhood.

25|$|The Lincoln Stars (also {{known as}} the Lincoln Stars of New York or the New York Lincoln Stars) were a Negro league {{baseball}} team that played in New York City from 1914 to 1917. Their home stadium was the Lenox Oval, located at Lenox Avenue and 145th Street in Manhattan.

25|$|To {{facilitate}} the securitization of non-mortgage assets, businesses substituted private credit enhancements. First, they over-collateralised pools of assets; shortly thereafter, they improved third-party and structural enhancements. In 1985, securitization techniques {{that had been}} developed in the mortgage market were applied {{for the first time}} to a class of non-mortgage assets — automobile loans. A pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume, auto loans <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> match for structured finance; their maturities, considerably shorter than those of mortgages, made the timing of cash flows more predictable, and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence.|$|E
25|$|In late 2004, in {{effort to}} {{maintain}} {{the balance of power}} in the region, Chen began eagerly pushing for an US$18billion arms purchase from the United States, but the Pan-Blue Coalition repeatedly blocked the deal in the legislature. Criticism has been made of this, citing contradictory arguments used, such as that the weapons were not what Taiwan needed, or that the weapons <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea but too expensive. By late 2006, the KMT had signalled it would support some of the arms sale being approved, but failed to pass a revised arms bill by the end of the legislative session in early 2007, despite promises by then KMT chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, to do that.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1937, Hearst {{began selling}} {{some of his}} art {{collection}} to help relieve the burden he had suffered from the depression. The first year he sold 11 million dollars worth. In 1941 he put about 20,000 items up for sale that <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> indication of his wide and varied tastes. Included in the items he put up for sale were paintings by van Dyke, crosiers, chalices, Charles Dickens's sideboard, pulpits, stained glass, arms and armor, George Washington's waistcoat, and Thomas Jefferson's Bible. Despite the magnitude of these sales, when Hearst Castle was finally given to the State of California there were still enough items for the whole house to {{be considered as a}} museum.|$|E
25|$|He reigned about 14 years (130–116 BC). He was a {{child at}} his succession, {{and for this reason}} the power was kept by his mother who acted as his regent. At some point her mother seems to have {{poisoned}} all of Ariarathes’ five brothers; but the infant king was saved by people loyal to the dynasty and had Nysa killed. These facts <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> pretext for his maternal uncle King Mithridates V Euergetes of Pontus (150 BC–120 BC), for trying to assert control over the country. For this he married Ariarathes to his maternal cousin Laodice of Cappadocia, his first daughter. Laodice bore Ariarathes one daughter and two sons: Nysa who married King Nicomedes III Euergetes of Bithynia; Ariarathes VII Philometor and Ariarathes VIII Epiphanes.|$|E

Political changes in his native country led in 1978 to the first full exhibition of his painting and graphic work, at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid. In 1993, {{the year of the}} hundredth anniversary of his birth, several exhibitions were held, among which the most prominent were those held in the Fundació Joan Miró, Barcelona, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, and the Galerie Lelong, Paris. In 2011, another retrospective was mounted by the Tate Modern, London, and travelled to Fundació Joan Miró and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.. Joan Miró, Printmaking, Fundación Joan Miró (2013).

Computer Games Magazine said that while the missions <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea in theory, they are [...] "too simple and similar", claiming that this caused players to become bored and camp for items outside anyway.

Prisoners had the option and could choose to be transformed from being a prisoner of war to become a free worker in a German factory. Around 221,000 prisoners joined the scheme. The policy benefited the Germans, for whom the prisoners <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> source of extra labour, but it meant they were also able to transfer to the front German soldiers guarding POW camps, freeing 30,000 of them {{as a result of the}} policy.|$|E
