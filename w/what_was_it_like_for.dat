40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} three {{aspects of the}} author’s early work {{on the evolution of}} the cooperation. First, it explains how the idea for a computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma was inspired by the artificial intelligence research on computer checkers and computer chess. Second, it shows how the vulnerability of simple reciprocity to misunderstanding or misimplementation can be eliminated with the addition of some degree of generosity or contrition. Third, it recounts the unusual collaboration between the author, a political scientist, and William D. Hamilton, an evolutionary biologist. 1 This article is a response to three questions, starting with the one I am asked most often. 1. How did you get the idea for a computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma? 2. After thirty years and nine thousand citations, do you see any problems with your early work on the evolution of cooperation? 3. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> you as a political scientist to work with William Hamilton...|$|E

Based upon the analysis of data from interviews, observations, applied tasks, and focus groups, five invariant themes were elicited. These included common background and experiences of participants, characteristics or tendencies of those who were high and low spatial ability, common errors made in spatial sketching tasks, approaches and processes relative to spatial problem solving activities, and feelings that were expressed or observed in the participants relative to spatial tasks. Outcomes of the study were the confirmation of effective instructional methods used in the course, the acknowledgement of the importance of object decomposition skills in spatial problem solving, and a systematic process for the generation of isometric pictorials from multiview drawings. This contribution includes a listing of teaching implications and recommendations, as well as suggestions for future qualitative studies on spatial ability. ...|$|E

The context is psychiatric and orthopaedic care, {{and the research}} is based on caring science. The research question <b>is</b> this: <b>What</b> characterizes the relationship between caring and learning in a DEU? This will be illuminated from three perspectives; the student, supervisor and patient perspectives.

The question for the supervisor <b>is</b> this: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to supervise nursing students on a DEU? And the final question is directed at the patient: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> cared for by nursing students in a DEU?

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a research study using grounded theory methodology {{to explore the}} experiences {{of women who have}} unplanned abdominal surgery at the time of childbirth, commonly referred to as casearean section. The intent {{of this study was to}} describe, understand and finally encapsulate in a model the personal impact on mothers of unplanned abdominal surgery at the the time of birth, for women who receive care within the current New Zealand maternity services. Ten participants who had unplanned casearean sections were asked to share their personal experiences during unstructured interviews. The question asked was: <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> you when you had your baby and what does it mean for you now? The data analysis in this study shows the experience for these mothers to be very stressful. Coming to terms with a birthing experience that did not meet their expectations, feelings of loss of control, unexpected pain and discomfort, difficulty in nurturing their babies and a great need to experience birth were all revealed. Mothers felt they were not listened to by some midwives and as a result had many unmet needs. Some midwives and health professionals appeared to view the major abdominal surgery that occurred as an alternative method of birthing, often trivialising the impact of the surgery and significance of having a casearean birth for this group of mothers. The implications for midwives and maternity services providers are broad, including the need for continuity of care and specialist nursing and midwifery care to meet the needs of this small but significant group of mothers and their babies...|$|E
40|$|In 2014 the centenary of the First World War was commemorated {{all over}} the world. Even though the war took place {{one hundred years ago}} we still find it {{important}} to re-member what happened, and we are still curious {{about what it was like}} for soldiers who served in the war. The subject of this thesis is how the war and its soldiers are depicted to modern European museum guests. I outline the categorization of First World War historians into four generations by US historian Jay Winters. With this as a starting point I investigate how the war and the soldiers who fought in it are depicted in two major European exhibitions, The First World War Galleries at The Imperial War Museum in London and 1914 - 1918 Der Erste Weltkrieg at Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin. The overall image of the war is studied through the answering of four questions: Who caused the war? How was it fought? How to understand the peace? And finally, what have the effects of the war been? The depiction of the soldiers is studied through the questions of; Why did they join the war? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> them during the war? And what happened to them, when they came back? I conclude that the English exhibition takes a very national perspective, whereas the German in many ways has a more global perspective. In London the war is depicted both as a catastrophe, but also as a just war, where heroes fought bravely. In Berlin the war is exclusively depicted as a catastrophe that only has losers. The exhibi-tions are very similar in their ways of depicting the soldiers. In both cases the soldiers play a very significant role in understanding the war...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} lean working practices on employees’ health at work, {{at home and in}} their communities. The research on which the paper is based examines the legacy of working life on people in their retirement or redundancy. The retirees and redundant workers in our sample were employed in five sectors; local government, housing, autocomponents, automotive assembly and the NHS. We assess the relationships between working practices, including lean production, workplace health and safety, and retirement or redundancy. Two crucial issues require close scrutiny. The first comprise the following interrelated concerns. To what degree do contemporary management practices impact upon employees’ reasons for taking early retirement or redundancy? Did managers decide on criteria for redundancy, (Burchell et al 2002) and was this achieved in collaboration with trade unions. Alternatively, was it an individual preference? For this question we will be examining the relationship between chronic injury, and/or mental stress, and their affects on the severance or redundancy package obtained. Second, where people leave at the statutory retirement age, how has the nature of their previous work, together with workplace regime, affected {{the way in which they}} experience retirement? While there is some research, by Burchell et al (2002), associating new forms of work, including forms of flexibility, with the criteria management use for deciding on redundancies, there is an absence of publish research into the consequences of lean working on individuals’ decisions to take redundancy and/or retirement. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> them, for those who are forced out of employment earlier than they would have wished, or anticipated, and what methods were used to achieve management aims? Moreover, while of course we have considerable evidence highlighting the use of retirement as a means to achieve redundancy (MacKenzie et al, 2006), we require research into how lean working regimes link to a political economy of redundancy and retirement with very particular effects upon people at home and in their communities. In other words, we are concerned not only with the origins and event of redundancy/retirement but with the continuities between experiences in and post work in respect of managerial ideology and the commoditisation central to lean cultures of consumption. This is one way to draw links between labour processes and the new productivist discourse of lean. Finally, all this is of particular importance because while trade unions have often been very effective were they can impact upon redundancy packages and employee protections, we know very little about what happens to people ‘after lean’. The paper will seek to link employees’ experiences of work regime, including their redundancy, or retirement experience, to what happens to them subsequently, in terms of their health and the quality of their lives at the end of their employment. Typically, the redundancy package is defined in monetary terms but where we understand more about the physical and psychological consequences of the end of an employees’ working life, we will be better able to require that former employers pay more. For us, this is another way of saying that the redundancy package, together with a monetary compensation value, fails to recognise a specific, and hitherto unrecognised, physical value in terms of long term health costs. This is vital in beginning to raise the debate about who pays for the social and economic costs incurred in the creation of redundancies in the context of the lean society. We would argue that, typically, this is covered by the social wage in respect of NHS and other welfare agencies but this passing the buck has been too easily accepted. Knowing more about the consequences of lean working will allow us to argue for an agenda which places the cost of lean work more squarely on the employer. It could be seen to being analogous to the new environmental consensus, of making the polluter pay...|$|E
