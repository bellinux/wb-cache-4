5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
500|$|To promote Hell Awaits, Slayer {{embarked}} on the Combat Tour with Venom and Exodus. Exodus guitarist Gary Holt commented, [...] "We immediately bonded with the Slayer guys. It was two bands of friends playing with one band of heroes, you know? <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> star-struck." ...|$|E
500|$|Hadden Frost (Calgary Bay, fell at the 4th fence): [...] "He {{jumped the}} fence fine, but landed a bit steep, which any horse could do. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> behind Ballabriggs {{at the time}} so {{we were in the}} right place. Maybe we'll come back and try again." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the defeat, Liverpool manager Joe Fagan {{could not}} fault the effort his players had put in: [...] "Independiente {{are a good}} {{defensive}} tactical team and we could find no way through, the weather was ideal, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as fit as they were. The South Americans have better ball control than we do. We were disappointed with the result but I wasn't disappointed with the display." ...|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Ogawa {{noted that}} the final period {{proved to be a}} large {{challenge}} for the team. Not only was the Xbox360 release imminent, but the PlayStation3 launch was scheduled not long afterwards. This put tremendous pressure on the team to develop for both systems. Similarly, series producer Takashi Iizuka recalled, [...] "we didn't have any time to polish and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> churning out content as quick as we could." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It {{was a hard}} decision, {{and this}} was not {{remotely}} {{having to do with}} us wanting to upgrade the acting ability or jump the character in age. The twins who play the part (Jaden and Ella Hiller) were not happy. We started feeling like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> being mean to these little girls, making them come to the stage. And the character is reaching an age where she would talk, and {{that was going to be}} an asset to us to have Cam and Mitch communicating with her." ...|$|E

500|$|Lennon, McCartney and Harrison {{pleaded with}} Starr to reconsider. He duly {{returned}} on 5 September {{to find his}} drum kit decorated with flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison. McCartney described the sessions for The Beatles as {{a turning point for}} the group, saying [...] "there was a lot of friction during that album. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> about to break up, and that was tense in itself", while Lennon later said [...] "the break-up of the Beatles can be heard on that album". Of the album's 30 tracks, only 16 have all four band members performing.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{gave this}} album a mixed review, {{referring}} to the [...] "Missing You" [...] cover as a [...] "misstep". Jon Weisberger thought that the album was [...] "consistent" [...] but added {{that it did not}} have any [...] "surprises". Brooks revealed in 2015 that the album's poor performance almost led to the duo splitting up, as he felt that “We weren’t really writing together anymore, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> kind of done", but they ultimately stayed together at the suggestion of Joe Galante, then the head of their label.|$|E
500|$|Vasey {{later told}} King that [...] "We were lucky, {{we were very}} lucky." [...] King countered that [...] "if you're {{inferring}} that {{what we did was}} luck, I don't agree with you sir because I think we weren't lucky, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> bloody good." [...] Vasey replied that what he meant was that he, Vasey, was lucky. He confided to Herring that he felt that he had made a potentially disastrous mistake: [...] "it is quite wrong to send out a small unit like the 2/6th Independent Company so far that they cannot be supported." ...|$|E

500|$|Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, {{was signed}} up {{by a major}} British {{recording}} company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works. Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason {{that it did not}} seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> trying to make music." ...|$|E
500|$|The next night, rioting again {{surrounded}} Christopher Street; participants remember differently which {{night was}} more frantic or violent. Many {{of the same}} people returned from the previous evening—hustlers, street youths, and [...] "queens"—but they were joined by [...] "police provocateurs", curious bystanders, and even tourists. Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: [...] "From going to places where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> out. We were in the streets." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{had four}} children—Linda's {{daughter}} Heather (legally adopted by Paul), Mary, Stella and James—and remained married until Linda's untimely death {{from breast cancer}} at age 56 in 1998. After Linda died, Paul stated in the Daily Mail, [...] "I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [...] perfect all the time... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies." ...|$|E

500|$|Soundgarden was {{the first}} grunge band to sign to a major label when the band joined the roster of A Records in 1989. However, Soundgarden did not achieve success initially, and only with {{successive}} album releases did the band meet with increased sales and wider attention. Bassist Ben Shepherd has not been receptive to the grunge label, saying in a 2013 interview [...] "That's just marketing. It's called rock and roll, or it's called punk rock or whatever. We never were Grunge, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> a band from Seattle." [...] They were ranked No.14 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.|$|E
500|$|... "So I {{head out}} there and he plays me the track and it sounds exactly like how {{you want it to}} sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking {{incredible}} sounding jam. It was kind of bare so I added some choir-sounding stuff and then thicked out the samples with my voice. That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, {{this is going to be}} the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.' It kind of freaked me out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{were under}} the impression– {{he looked like he}} was going down, but we didn't hear any {{mechanical}} difficulty. We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off and go into the Hudson. But he just rose a little bit, his altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom! He disappears into the Trade Center." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1933, Lombard and Powell {{divorced}} after 26 {{months of}} marriage, although they remained {{very good friends}} {{until the end of}} Lombard's life. At the time, she blamed it on their careers, but in a 1936 interview, she admitted that this [...] "had {{little to do with the}} divorce. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> two completely incompatible people". She appeared in five films that year, beginning with the drama From Hell to Heaven and continuing with Supernatural, her only horror vehicle. After a small role in The Eagle and the Hawk, a war film starring Fredric March and Cary Grant, she starred in two melodramas: Brief Moment, which critics enjoyed, and White Woman, where she was paired with Charles Laughton.|$|E
500|$|The ad was {{conceived}} {{by the agency}} Wieden+Kennedy. Copywriters Derek Barnes and Paul Renner were in a shopping mall when they noticed many of the youths around them wearing Air Jordan shoes, despite Jordan having retired in 2003: [...] "Just one look around the food court, you knew kids still waved his flag." [...] The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury. Waterbury explained, [...] "We thought {{of the fact that}} a version of him is alive in everyone that loves basketball. And there are moments in Jordan's career where you just say the move, or the game, and people who love the man, and love the sport, immediately can imagine that scene. Here, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> taking advantage of those incredible moments." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{entered the}} Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record Mother's Milk. [...] "It was weird when I first joined the band because we {{recorded}} the album after I'd {{been in the}} band {{for just a few}} months and Chad had actually been in for just two weeks", Frusciante recalled. [...] "I was still a little bit confused about my position and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we've been doing we're now like an eight armed cosmic octopus!" [...] Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record's thirteen tracks with the intent of the band obtaining a hit record.|$|E
