500|$|The Independent {{reported}} that Moffat [...] "stresses that Chalk is a sitcom, not some banner-waving, agitprop pamphlet", {{but is still}} [...] "passionate about education". Moffat criticises [...] "the [...] government talk about the specially talented needing more education, but that's absurd, the equivalent of hospitals for the healthy." [...] Moffat expected that teachers would find the show funny because it [...] "has certain notes of accuracy", recognising familiar myths such as the dead teacher and teachers' contempt for their pupils. Moffat continued to say that teachers would [...] "also recognise the pathological preference for science over arts and all that league-table shit. An official teaching organisation couldn't say, 'It's a very faithful portrayal,' but I hope they'd say, 'It's a comedy series. <b>Why</b> <b>take</b> it seriously?' You couldn't claim {{it is the most}} flattering series, but, there again, people continued to stay at hotels after Fawlty Towers." ...|$|E
500|$|Juxtaposed {{against the}} {{struggle}} to survive is the enchanting but short beauty of childhood. The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy-tale like quality, leading the BolognaRagazzi Awards jury to speak of [...] "the great Secret (that) lurks in the story". It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation. The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh realities that adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings' writings, expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra [...] "Penny" [...] Baxter delivers to his son Jody {{at the end of}} The Yearling: [...] "Ever’ man wants life to be a fine thing, and [...] easy. ’Tis fine, boy, powerful fine, but ’tain’t easy. Life knocks a man down and he gits up and it knocks him down again.... What’s he to do then?... <b>Why,</b> <b>take</b> it for his share and go on." [...] Unlike Jody, who realizes the magic of his childhood is [...] "gone forever" [...] with the death of his fawn, Calpurnia retains the secret river and the magic in her mind.|$|E
500|$|Other court clerks in the U.S. {{have also}} refused to issue {{marriage}} licenses to same-sex couples. The probate judges of several counties in Alabama have stopped issuing marriage licenses to anyone. Probate Judge Nick Williams of Washington County, Alabama, said he stopped issuing licenses altogether to avoid discrimination and said, [...] "I completely disagree with the authority the Supreme Court has." [...] Probate Judge John Enslen of Elmore County, Alabama, said the federal government, not state probate offices, should be the entity issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Casey Davis (unrelated to Kim Davis), a clerk in Casey County, Kentucky, said, [...] "We've not tried to prevent same-sex marriages, we've only tried to exercise our First Amendment rights", adding that such applicants could apply in other counties. Kay Schwartz, a clerk in Whitley County, Kentucky, felt oppressed: [...] "There's a law against bullying... <b>Why</b> <b>take</b> away the majority's right [...] to give the minority their rights?" [...] She suggested the possibility of other options {{to meet the needs}} of same-sex applicants, such as an online service. The ACLU has no plans for legal action against other court clerks or probate judges. National attention has not been on them as the ACLU brought no case against them, speculated University of Kentucky political science professor D.B. Riggle: [...] "The action in Rowan County may be in part due to the availability of plaintiffs for a case." ...|$|E
