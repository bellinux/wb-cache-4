If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

50|$|A {{potential}} {{disadvantage of}} AGC is that <b>when</b> recording <b>something</b> <b>like</b> music with quiet and loud passages such as classical music, the AGC {{will tend to}} make the quiet passages louder and the loud passages quieter, compressing the dynamic range; {{the result can be}} a reduced musical quality if the signal is not re-expanded when playing, as in a companding system.|$|R

[...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. I think when you hear Kanye West do it, or include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world that we live in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour.

2500|$|Achatina fulica {{and other}} Achatina species, giant African snails. They can {{grow up to}} 326mm (1ft ¾ in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was {{purposely}} introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, {{it is a serious}} agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate Achatina. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.

60|$|There were {{of course}} moments of terrible vacillation, a period even <b>when</b> <b>something</b> almost <b>like</b> passion bid her throw {{refinement}} to the winds.

60|$|It will be conceded, {{this was}} a very respectable puff for the year 1795, <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> moderation, truth, and propriety were {{observed}} upon such occasions. The effect was to bring the English general's name into the mouths of the whole state; a baronet causing a greater sensation then, in America, than a duke would produce to-day. It had the effect, however, of bringing around General Willoughby many of his father's, and his own old friends, and he was as well received in New York, twelve years after the termination of the conflict, as if he had fought on the other side. The occurrence of the French revolution, and the spread of doctrines that were termed Jacobinical, early removed all the dissensions between {{a large portion of the}} whigs of America and the tories of England, on this side of the water at least; and Providence only can tell what might have been the consequences, had this feeling been thoroughly understood on the other.|$|E
60|$|Though Rousseau, {{like many}} other fanatics, had a {{remarkable}} vein of common sense in him, (witness his remarks on duelling, on landscape-gardening, on French poetry, and much of his thought on education,) we cannot trace many practical results to his teaching, least of all in politics. For the great difficulty with his system, if system it may be called, is, that, while it professes to follow nature, it not only assumes as a starting-point that the individual man may be made over again, but proceeds {{to the conclusion that}} man himself, that human nature, must be made over again, and governments remodelled on a purely theoretic basis. But <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> an experiment in this direction was made in 1789, not only did it fail as regarded man in general, but even as regards the particular variety of man that inhabited France. The Revolution accomplished many changes, and beneficent ones, yet it left France peopled, not by a new race without traditions, but by Frenchmen. Still, there could not but be a wonderful force {{in the words of a}} man who, above all others, had the secret of making abstractions glow with his own fervor; and his ideas--dispersed now in the atmosphere of thought --have influenced, perhaps still continue to influence, speculative minds, which prefer swift and sure generalization to hesitating and doubtful experience.|$|E

6000|$|I could {{discover}} that my {{person in this}} crowd attracted attention as a stranger. I say as a stranger; for I am unwilling to betray so much vanity as to ascribe {{the manner in which}} many eyes followed me, to any vain notion that I was known or admired. Still, I will not so far disparage the gifts of a bountiful Providence, as to leave the impression that my face, person, or air was particularly disagreeable. This would not be the fact; and I have now reached a time of life <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the truth may be told, without the imputation of conceit. My mother often boasted to her intimates, [...] "that Corny was one of the best-made, handsomest, most active, and genteelest youths in the colony." [...] This I know, for such things will leak out; but mothers are known to have a remarkable weakness on the subject of their children. As I was the sole surviving offspring of my dear mother, {{who was one of the}} best-hearted women that ever breathed, it is highly probable that the notions she entertained of her son partook largely of the love she bore me. It is true, my aunt Legge, on more than one occasion, has been heard to express a very similar opinion; though nothing can be more natural than that sisters should think alike, on a family matter of this particular nature, more especially as my aunt Legge never had a child of her own to love and praise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{rid of that}} horror," [...] thought Gwendolen, to {{whom the}} name of Mompert had {{become a sort of}} Mumbo-jumbo. She was very silent through the evening, and that night could hardly sleep at all in her little white bed. It was a rarity in her strong youth to be wakeful: and perhaps a still greater rarity for her to be careful that her mother should not know of her restlessness. But her state of mind was {{altogether}} new: she who had been used to feel sure of herself, and ready to manage others, had just taken a decisive step which she had beforehand thought that she would not take--nay, perhaps, was bound not to take. She could not go backward now; she liked a great deal of what lay before her; and there was nothing for her to like if she went back. But her resolution was dogged by the shadow of that previous resolve which had at first come as the undoubting movement of her whole being. While she lay on her pillow with wide-open eyes, [...] "looking on darkness which the blind do see," [...] she was appalled by the idea {{that she was going to}} do what she had once started away from with repugnance. It was new to her that a question of right or wrong in her conduct should rouse her terror; she had known no compunction that atoning caresses and presents could not lay to rest. But here had come a moment <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a new consciousness was awaked. She seemed on the edge of adopting deliberately, as a notion for all the rest of her life, what she had rashly said in her bitterness, when her discovery had driven her away to Leubronn:--that it did not signify what she did; she had only to amuse herself as best she could. That lawlessness, that casting away of all care for justification, suddenly frightened her: it came to her with the shadowy array of possible calamity behind it--calamity which had ceased to be a mere name for her; and all the infiltrated influences of disregarded religious teaching, as well as the deeper impressions of something awful and inexorable enveloping her, seemed to concentrate themselves in the vague conception of avenging power. The brilliant position she had longed for, the imagined freedom she would create for herself in marriage, the deliverance from the dull insignificance of her girlhood--all immediately before her; and yet they had come to her hunger like food with the taint of sacrilege upon it, which she must snatch with terror. In the darkness and loneliness of her little bed, her more resistant self could not act against the first onslaught of dread after her irrevocable decision. That unhappy-faced woman and her children--Grandcourt and his relations with her--kept repeating themselves in her imagination like the clinging memory of a disgrace, and gradually obliterated all other thought, leaving only the consciousness that she had taken those scenes into her life. Her long wakefulness seemed a delirium; a faint, faint light penetrated beside the window-curtain; the chillness increased. She could bear it no longer, and cried [...] "Mamma!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Maggie, {{all this}} time, moved about with a {{quiescence}} and even torpor of manner, so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor, that Lucy {{would have had}} to seek some other cause for such a change, if she had not been convinced that the position in which Maggie stood between Philip and her brother, and the prospect of her self-imposed wearisome banishment, were quite enough to account for a large amount of depression. But under this torpor there was a fierce battle of emotions, such as Maggie in all her life of struggle had never known or foreboded; it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in ambush till now, and had suddenly started up full-armed, with hideous, overpowering strength! There were moments in which a cruel selfishness seemed to be getting possession of her; why should not Lucy, why should not Philip, suffer? She had had to suffer through many years of her life; and who had renounced anything for her? And <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that fulness of existence--love, wealth, ease, refinement, all that her nature craved--was brought within her reach, why was she to forego it, that another might have it,--another, who perhaps needed it less? But amidst all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making themselves heard with rising power, till, from time to time, the tumult seemed quelled. Was that existence which tempted her the full existence she dreamed? Where, then, would be all the memories of early striving; all the deep pity for another's pain, which had been nurtured in her through years of affection and hardship; all the divine presentiment of something higher than mere personal enjoyment, which had made the sacredness of life? She might as well hope to enjoy walking by maiming her feet, as hope to enjoy an existence in which she set out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs of her soul. And then, if pain were so hard to her, what was it to others? [...] "Ah, God! preserve me from inflicting--give me strength to bear it." [...] How had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she would once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate crime? When was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, {{as if it had been}} a loathsome thing? And yet, since this strange, sweet, subduing influence did not, should not, conquer her,--since it was to remain simply her own suffering,--her mind was meeting Stephen's in that thought of his, that they might still snatch moments of mute confession before the parting came. For was not he suffering too? She saw it daily--saw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which, as soon as he was not compelled to exert himself, he relapsed into indifference toward everything but the possibility of watching her. Could she refuse sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her like a low murmur of love and pain? She refused it less and less, till at last the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment's mutual gaze; they thought of it till it came, and when it had come, they thought of nothing else.|$|E
