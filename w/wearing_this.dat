5|$|A coronet {{of eleven}} pearls denotes a baron's arms in Sweden (the ancient nobility does {{also have the}} right to have the baronet crown by tradition), which also {{typically}} includes two barred helmets, each <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> coronet, and a third such coronet is placed above the shield, although some baronial arms feature three helmets or only one, and not every baron uses supporters. A Swedish Greve (Count) bears three barred helmets, each crowned with a coronet showing five leaves, and supporters are usually—though not always—present. The arms of Swedish counts also, from the late 17th century, began using manteaux (see the Greater Coat of Arms of Sweden, pictured above) in place of the traditional mantling, although this practice has since been deprecated. Untitled nobility (others granted noble status by letters patent) also bore a barred helm and a coronet showing two pearls between three leaves.|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E

25|$|In the past, a kimono {{would often}} be entirely taken apart for washing, and then re-sewn for <b>wearing.</b> <b>This</b> {{traditional}} washing method is called arai hari. Because the stitches {{must be taken}} out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand sewn. Arai hari is very expensive and difficult {{and is one of}} the causes of the declining popularity of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially for high-end garments.|$|E
25|$|The uniform reintroduced a khaki service coat {{worn with}} a black necktie and {{shoulder}} boards. The prescribed headgear was a combination cap with khaki cover, or optionally a khaki garrison cap. It was intended {{to provide a more}} practical alternative to the Service Dress Whites and a more formal alternative to the Service Khakis. This uniform was frequently worn in public by then-CNO and subsequently Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen; on 1 May 2011, Mullen was seen <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> uniform in the iconic photograph in the White House Situation Room during the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. In October 2012, cost considerations led to the cancellation of the full-scale reintroduction of the uniform, and the uniform was dropped from the Navy.|$|E
500|$|In the film, {{the line}} was an ad-lib by Grant and not in any version of the {{original}} script. According to Vito Russo in The Celluloid Closet (1981, revised 1987), the script originally had Grant's character say [...] "I...I suppose you think it's odd, my <b>wearing</b> <b>this.</b> I realize it looks odd...I don't usually...I mean, I don't own one of these". Russo suggests that this indicates that people in Hollywood (at least in Grant's circles) {{were familiar with the}} slang connotations of the word; however, neither Grant nor anyone involved in the film suggested this.|$|E

500|$|Mangalorean Catholic men {{traditionally}} wore long, loose-frilled, {{white or}} black coats known as Kutanv (similar to the Maratha loose coats with buttons), over a Zibbo (loose shirt), while the Pudvem (dhoti), a piece of unstitched cloth, usually around [...] long, was wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist. The turban called Mundaas or Urmal, were usually flattened like the Coorgi turbans. It was a long white piece of cloth with a Todop (golden hem) tied around the head like a turban in a particular manner by which they could be easily identified as Catholics. In modern times however, this mode has changed. Only a few older people can be seen <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> traditional dress on church-going occasions.|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Macartney {{delivered}} {{the ball at}} a relatively fast pace for a left-arm orthodox spinner, comparable in speed to Derek Underwood. He {{was known for his}} consistent length and his well-concealed faster ball which often caught batsmen off guard. On sticky wickets, he was often incisive, and these conditions helped him take five wickets in an innings 17 times in his first-class career. He was known for his miserly attitude, often giving the impression that he would rather bowl ten consecutive maidens rather than take wickets if it meant conceding runs. This extended to his off-field activities, where he was considered careful with money. On the 1926 tour of England, he and Mailey visited a hat shop that had a tradition of giving souvenir hats to cricketers of touring Australian squads. When asked if he would like a similar style to the one he received in 1921, Macartney referred to the hat on his head and replied [...] "Not on your life. I've been <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> since you gave it to me in 1921." [...] Macartney's notorious fiscal obsessions irritated his captain Warwick Armstrong on the 1921 tour; during the trip, he would hoard all manner of goods that were given to the team as gifts.|$|E
500|$|Burton hired Wesley Strick {{to do an}} uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, [...] "When I {{was hired}} to write Batman Returns (Batman II at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'." [...] Warner Bros. {{presented}} Strick with warming, or freezing Gotham City, a plot point they would later use in Batman & Robin. Strick gained inspiration from a Moses parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby. Robin appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin [...] "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [...] the loner of loners." [...] Robin {{started out as a}} juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic. Waters explained, [...] "He's <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the Batmobile, which I notice they used in the third film!" [...] Marlon Wayans was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.|$|E

However, some believe this pair {{may have been the}} second pair created, therefore explaining the [...] "Double" [...] in the lining, but still worn by Garland and Koshay. Several pairs of Garland's own shoes are size 6. Also, Garland can be seen <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> pair in photos taken after the film's primary shooting was finished in 1939.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, the Phillies {{front office}} {{modified}} the uniform into an all-burgundy version with white trimmings, {{to be worn}} for Saturday games. They were called [...] "Saturday Night Specials" [...] and were worn {{for the first and}} last time on May 19, 1979, [...] a 10–5 loss to the Expos. The immediate reaction of the media, fans, and players alike was negative, with many describing the despised uniforms as pajama-like. As such, the idea was hastily abandoned. Mike Schmidt did wear the uniform during the MLB All-Star Tour of Japan following the 1979 season. [...] The final appearance on field (to date) of this uniform was during the closing ceremonies at Veterans Stadium on September 28, 2003. [...] There was a rather large procession of players during the post game ceremony, most in uniform. [...] Former pitcher Larry Christenson, the starting pitcher in the original game, came out <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> old burgundy uniform, and was the only one to do so.|$|E

The monarch is clothed in a leonine wig and court garments ( [...] lace shirt and cuffs, brocade rhingraves, red - heeled shoes adorned with diamond buckles, and silk stockings held by garters [...] ) wears the necklace of the Order the Holy Spirit and the royal coat pinned high on the shoulder to highlight the former sword dancer and his thin legs as Louis XIV had insisted that his features be [...] "true" ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1970 to 1991, the Phillies sported colors, uniforms, and a logo {{that were}} noticeably {{different}} from what had come before, or since, but that were widely embraced by even traditionally minded fans. A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped {{as part of the}} team's official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet {{the most important aspect of}} the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies [...] "P" [...] that, thanks to its unique shape and [...] "baseball stitched" [...] center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. It was while <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> uniform style and color motif that the club achieved its most enduring success, including a World Series title in 1980 and another World Series appearance in 1983. Its continued popularity with fans is still evident, as even today Phillies home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts, and/or jackets emblazoned with the iconic [...] "P" [...] and burgundy color scheme. The current Phillies team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their {{original}} 1960–1963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or [...] "third jersey" [...] and was usually worn {{at least once}} a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007 against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008 against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009 as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 1960–1963 uniform may also be used on other special occasion. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
