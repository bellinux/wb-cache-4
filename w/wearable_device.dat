25|$|Starting {{from this}} principle, the {{development}} of upper-limb non-invasive ambulatory robotic exoskeletons {{is presented as a}} promising solution for patients who cannot benefit from medication to suppress the tremor. In this area robotic exoskeletons have emerged, in the form of orthoses, to provide motor assistance and functional compensation to disabled people. An orthosis is a <b>wearable</b> <b>device</b> that acts in parallel to the affected limb. In the case of tremor management, the orthosis must apply a damping or inertial load to a selected set of limb articulations.|$|E
25|$|The Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth {{low energy}} <b>wearable</b> <b>device,</b> {{developed}} by Nintendo's Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain {{actions in the}} game without looking at their smart device. When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates. The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until {{the next time they}} sign into the app on their mobile device. The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin. The decision to create the device rather than create a smart watch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smart watch is prohibitively expensive. It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.|$|E

40|$|Conventional uses of {{technology}} {{are capable of}} influencing the direction technology advances in a society. They are constructed from the collective knowledge and cultural behaviours which users adopt. What manifests from the conventions is a rigid structure that inhibits future, deviative or innovative technology to sustain in society. The conventions influence how society continues to engage with technology in daily activities. The influences from conventional uses {{of technology}} are not restricted to such organic processes, but can be influenced by us, if we take action to do so. The purpose of this exegesis is to illustrate ways we can create approaches to shaping and directing the evolution of technology. This is illustrated from a set of approaches discussed on changing how a selected technology, <b>wearable</b> <b>devices,</b> is established in society. The societal impacts of factors related to user engagement with <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> are first investigated and speculated. The approaches are then created through theorising how relative factors can be mediated to alter the establishment of <b>wearable</b> <b>devices.</b> The speculation on how <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> become established in society accumulated to a practical outcome: Wearable Beacon. This project visually portrays the researcher’s own perception on the ways <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> mediate and relate to the user’s body. The outcome communicates the researcher’s idea of <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> enhancing and functioning in similar ways {{to that of the}} nervous system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, recent {{technology}} for wearables to detect electrolyte {{of sweat and}} biocompatible smart materials for additive manufacturing (AM) have been surveyed. The challenges and gaps toward successful realization of functional <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> as a kit to test biomarkers were, then, discussed. While <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> sensing physical conditions of users are popular in a consumer market, <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> to detect chemical components of human sweat have little studied due to several limitations such as contacting human skin and controlling ambient parameters etc. AM technology makes innovative products realized, differing from conventional fabrication and design methodologies due to unlimited design freedom for manufacturing and material selections. We investigate the potentials of AM to be applied for <b>wearable</b> <b>devices,</b> although detecting chemical biofluids requires wider and deeper researches {{on the development of}} advanced materials and AM process...|$|R

40|$|Affective {{computing}} is {{the study}} and development of systems that can recognize human emotions and feelings. Emotions are always an interesting topic of research and these days researchers are trying to develop systems which can recognize, interpret and process emotions based on human physiological and neural changes {{for the development of}} well-being. As the market for <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> is expanding, it provides more opportunity of research in emotion sharing with remote person.

40|$|Abstract Context: In recent years, {{health and}} fitness have drawn greater {{attention}} to consumers in China. The demand of <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> has risen {{and the number of}} potential customers is large. This study would like to explore if the <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> match customers’ desire and expectation, and what influence users’ behavioral intention to use <b>wearable</b> <b>devices.</b> Aim: This thesis aims to examine the acceptance of <b>wearable</b> <b>devices,</b> in particular, smart bands and dedicated healthcare applications, in order to find usage patterns, preferences with regard to product features, and the determining factors of users’ acceptance. Method: This study is a descriptive and explanatory research. First, a literature review on 1) <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> in healthcare, and 2) technology acceptance model and related models was conducted. Then, a research model with 11 hypothesizes was derived based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), trust model, and technological personality construct. The research model and the hypotheses were tested by conducting a quantitative questionnaire survey in China. 158 responses were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling in smartPLS software package. Results: The factors affecting directly the user’ intention to use smart bands are: perceived usefulness, social influence, affinity, and compatibility. Trust and perceived ease of use affect behavioral intention indirectly through perceived usefulness...|$|R
