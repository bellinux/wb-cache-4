He {{said that he has}} so many talents because he wants to be the perfect man for Sakura.

2500|$|Yukina is a {{third year}} junior high student who is known in her school by the icy cold gaze she gives off. Titled as the [...] "Absolute Zero Snow Woman" [...] by her classmates, Yukina, unknown to many but a {{selected}} few, is also the popular cell phone novelist Yupina. Yukina {{comes across as a}} cold person who is quite witted and also demanding, asking at times unreasonable requests to Shigure called [...] "Missions"... but in reality is a rather shy, caring person, who has not experienced true love yet, and hopes to do it soon. Yukina has long brown hair, brown eyes, and wears glasses(She is terrified when she is seen without them, based on a traumatic event that happened <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little).</b> At some point, she was unsure of her feelings towards Shigure and Akira, so she decided to go out with both of them to finally pick the one who makes her heart race the most. Although she had stronger feelings towards Shigure than to her cousin, Yukina chose Akira. When she realized her true feelings, she broke up with Akira and later on, confessed them to Shigure when he came back from his studies.|$|E

2500|$|The song is a ballad, {{beginning}} with a simple guitar-based arrangement, however later expanding to a band and orchestra arrangement. The song's lyrics are an extended narrative that {{tell the story of}} Uemura and her grandmother. When she was a 3rd grader (8 years old), she lived at her grandmother's house next door to her parents, playing gomoku, eating nanban-style duck noodle soup when they went out shopping, watching videotapes of the comedy program Yoshimoto Shinkigeki and helping her every day. Uemura was not very fond of cleaning toilets, so her grandmother told her that a beautiful goddess lives in the toilet, if she cleaned it every day, this goddess would make her into a beautiful woman. As Uemura grew older, the communication gap between her and her grandmother worsened and the two grew apart. Uemura, feeling resentful, moved away from home with her then boyfriend and rarely came home to visit. [...] Her grandmother later became more ill and was hospitalized two years after Uemura left for Tokyo. Uemura visited her, saying [...] "Grandma, I'm home!" [...] as she used to <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> before the two began to fight. Her grandmother could not say much and the next morning died quietly in her sleep. Uemura believes her grandmother was waiting for her, besides being left alone from her all this time. She feels regret for hurting her grandmother and says thank you to her {{at the end of the}} song.|$|E
60|$|She {{was nearly}} as tall as himself, but he liked to recall the time <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> {{and they were all}} in all to each other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So do I,' piped {{the other}} like a rather more melancholy bullfinch. 'Mamma can't play with us so nicely as you do. I don't think she ever learnt playing <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little.</b> When shall {{we come to}} see you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{but your}} own niece and Mr. Bulstrode's great favorite--and yours too, I am sure, Harriet! I thought, at one time, you meant him for Kate, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a <b>little</b> older." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' cried Eustacie, 'poor, good Mademoiselle Noemi! she {{threaded}} {{them for}} my child, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very <b>little.</b> Ah! {{could she have}} given them to you--could it then not have been true--that horror?' ...|$|R
50|$|Doran {{says she}} fell in love with theatre <b>when</b> <b>she</b> found Peter Pan's shadow in the {{backstage}} at a theatre <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> girl and realised that it was made of pantyhose.|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} were dressed roughly for the country. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> Ursula pattered about in little wooden clogs, a blue overall over her thick red dress, a red shawl crossed {{on her breast}} and tied behind again. So she ran with her father to the garden.|$|E
6000|$|O-Toyo was a darling, but she lacked several things--conversation for one. You cannot live on giggles. She shall remain {{unmarried}} at Nagasaki, while I roast {{a battered}} heart before {{the shrine of}} a big Kentucky blonde, who had for a nurse <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> a negro [...] "mammy." ...|$|E
60|$|That night Mr. Hemphill dreamed hard of a {{girl who}} had loved him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> and who {{continued}} to love him {{now that she had}} grown to be wonderfully handsome. He was going out to sail with her in a boat far and far away, where nobody could find them or bring them back.|$|E
6000|$|... "So she is; as lovely as ever she can stand. But {{she does}} not seem to have much to say for herself. I {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> girl <b>she</b> never would speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I used to {{know your}} mother long ago <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> girl," [...] he said. [...] "I wonder if she remembers me. Ask her when you go home if she remembers Bobby Turner." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{you will}} {{remember}} that Joan of Arc sang this song with us around the Tree <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> child, and always loved it. And that hallows it, yes, you will grant that: ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{the rest of the}} roof fell in, hiding the tower in spouts and veils of flame. Here they might not stay if they would live. Lifting her {{mistress}} in her strong arms, as she was wont to do <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> Emlyn found the head of the stair, so that when the wind blew the smoke aside for an instant, those below saw that both had vanished, as they thought withered in the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{medicine}} {{will not}} harm her?" [...] asked the woman doubtfully. [...] "She has worked me bitter wrong indeed, yet {{she is my}} sister, whom I nursed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> and I {{do not wish to}} do her hurt. If only he will welcome me back and treat me kindly, I am willing even that she should dwell on beneath my husband's roof, bearing his children, for will they not be of my own blood?" ...|$|E
60|$|He looked ill! And {{suddenly}} she realised that her thoughts were not of him.... <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> {{he would take}} her on his back; he had built cocked hats for her and paper boats; had taught her to ride; slid her between his knees; given her things without number; and taken his payment in kisses. And now he was ill, {{and she was not}} thinking of him! He had been all that was most dear to her, yet before her eyes would only come the vision of another.|$|E
6000|$|And earlier, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> maid of five years, she {{informed}} a visitor that <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> {{in a church}} only once, {{and that was the}} time when Clara was [...] "crucified" [...] [christened]....|$|R

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> girl, <b>she</b> {{lived in}} Armenia, then in Mexico, {{and later in}} Palo Alto California, and in Bogota. In 2008 she {{continued}} with her acting, dancing, and painting lessons that she had started in Armenia.|$|R
6000|$|Nor {{would it}} have been fair to blame Gertrude in the matter. While she was yet a child, this friend of her mother's had been thrown with her, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> more than a child, she found that this friend had become a lover. She liked him, in one sense loved him, and was {{accustomed}} to regard him as one whom it would be almost wrong in her not to like and love. What wonder then that when he first spoke to her warm words of adoration, she had not been able at once to know her own heart, and tell him that his hopes would be in vain? ...|$|E
60|$|Selina Grenville was the {{youngest}} daughter of a sister of Sir Edmund Arundel, who had, {{like the rest of}} her family, died early. She had been a good deal abroad with her father and a married sister. Her uncommon beauty and engaging manners gained her, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> more than eighteen, the affection of Lord Marchmont, a more distant connection of the Arundel family; and happily for Selina, she appreciated him sufficiently to return his love so thoroughly, as to lay aside all the little coquetries which had hitherto been the delight of her life; and to devote herself to him even as he deserved.|$|E
60|$|While she {{wondered}} thus, {{one of the}} dreadful-looking little creatures advanced to the fire, and taking from it a burning bough, held it over the thing that lay upon the ground, to give light to a companion {{who was about to}} do something to it with the stone knife. Next instant Nanea drew back her head from the hole, a stifled shriek upon her lips. She saw what it was now--it was the body of a man. Yes, and these were no ghosts; they were cannibals of whom <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> her mother had told her tales to keep her from wandering away from home.|$|E
5000|$|Shikata {{was born}} in Tokyo. She first {{developed}} an interest in music <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very <b>little,</b> after constantly singing with her mother. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> first interested in songs from Minna no Uta, and later <b>when</b> <b>she</b> learnt the piano classical music.|$|R
50|$|Shima is the Oldest Child of her family. She {{lives in}} Dubai and rides her Harley-Davidsonas a {{professional}} Biker. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> also Working as a Model, translator, and Mathematic teacher. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> kid, <b>she</b> had travelled to Austria. She would watchgirls riding motorcycles and dream of one day being able to ride one of her own.|$|R
50|$|Aimee Anne Gillespie {{has been}} friends with Madison {{ever since they}} were born (mentioned in Boy Oh Boy!, book #2 in the series). <b>She</b> <b>is</b> thin and blonde, and loves to dance ballet, stating that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{planning}} on being a professional ballerina <b>when</b> <b>she</b> grows up. She practices daily, sometimes even going before school to practice. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> also very afraid of water: <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>little,</b> <b>she</b> falls {{in the water and}} does not come up until a minute after. Aimee is diagnosed with anorexia in Picture Perfect after <b>she</b> faints. Aimee <b>is</b> a committed vegetarian and is always on diets, constantly believing <b>she</b> <b>is</b> overweight. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> very thin with wavy blonde hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps she {{was jealous}} of Preston, but she never {{acknowledged}} it. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> she used {{once in a while}} to come shyly and sit on my lap, and look at me without saying anything. I hadn't the slightest notion what was in the child's mind, and her reserve increased as she grew older. She seemed to have developed a sort of philosophy of her own even before she went away to school, and to have certain strongly defined tastes. She liked, for instance, to listen to music, and for that very reason would never learn to play. We couldn't make her, as a child.|$|E
6000|$|Those {{three days}} at Robin Hill had been exciting, sad, embarrassing. Memories of her dead brother, {{memories}} of Val's courtship; the ageing of her father, not seen for twenty years, something funereal in his ironic gentleness {{which did not}} escape one who had much subtle instinct; above all, the presence of her stepmother, whom she could still vaguely remember as the [...] "lady in grey" [...] of days <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> and grandfather alive and Mademoiselle Beauce so cross because that intruder gave her music lessons--all these confused and tantalised a spirit which had longed to find Robin Hill untroubled. But Holly was adept at keeping things to herself, and all had seemed to go quite well.|$|E
60|$|And then, quite suddenly, {{yet with}} no abruptness or sense of discovery, {{just as if}} it were {{something}} which she had known all along, the truth came upon her. It was Wally, the thought of Wally, the knowledge that Wally existed, that made her happy. He was a solid, comforting, reassuring fact in a world of doubts and perplexities. She {{did not need to be}} with him to be fortified, it was enough just to think of him. Present or absent, his personality heartened her like fine weather or music or a sea-breeze--or like that friendly, soothing night-light which they used to leave in her nursery <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> to scare away the goblins and see her safely over the road that led to the gates of the city of dreams.|$|E
50|$|Allison Lefcort {{was born}} the {{daughter}} of Robert and Ronni Lefcort, a Yale University alumni and a visual artist. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> girl, Lefcort created a portrait of Dan Marino, which is displayed in her studio in Boca Raton, Florida.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just so,' said Lady Merrifield. 'Well, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> older, poor Mr. White, {{who was one}} of {{the most}} honourable and scrupulous of men, took alarm, and saw that it would never do to have the young {{officers}} running after her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are right,' said Miss Tox; 'and it's {{a credit}} to you, Polly, that you were always her friend <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a <b>little</b> child. You <b>were</b> her friend long before I was, Polly,' said Miss Tox; 'and you're a good creature. Robin!' ...|$|R
