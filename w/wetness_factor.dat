This required the estimation of the cloud factor C and surface <b>wetness</b> <b>factor</b> W from AL 79 Figure 1 and calculation of the Sun’s zenith distance ζ using AL 79 ’s equation 13. However, as will be shown, the equation to compute heat flux H on an inclined surface H ′ (AL 79, equation 17) is in error.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation for 'running wet' and evaporative aircraft anti-icing systems is developed. The model {{is based on}} the analysis of the liquid water film which forms in the regions of direct impingement and, then, breaks up near the impingement limits into rivulets. The <b>wetness</b> <b>factor</b> distribution resulting from the film breakup and the rivulet configuration on the surface are predicted using a stability analysis theory and the laws of mass energy conservation. The solid structure is modeled as a multiple layer wall. The anti-icing system modeled is of the thermal type utilizing hot air and/or electrical heating elements embedded within the wall layers. Experimental observations revealing some of the basic physics of the water flow on the surface are presented. Detailed qualitative documentation of the tests are given. Several numerical examples are considered, and the effect of some of the involved parameters on the system performance are investigated...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of 16 selected soil properties {{in relation to}} the established 1970 s forage yields was performed by principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis. The predictive values of 16 selected physical and chemical soil properties were tested across 595 soils placed into two drainage groups. Properties reflecting the subsurface density and rooting ability of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) provided the greatest explanation of alfalfa yield variation on the well drained soils. Depth of the surface horizons and <b>wetness</b> <b>factors</b> had the highest correlation with grass-legume mixture yields on the poorly drained soils. The models explained approximately 50 % of the 1970 s yield variation in alfalfa yields and approximately 50 % of the 1970 s yield variation in grass-legume mixture yields. The forage yield trend calculated from farmer yields of 0. 99 Mg ha- 1 was added to the 1970 s predicted and established yields to obtain the 1990 s predicted and established yields. Current 1990 s yields were estimated using the equation produced by the regression of 1970 s basic management level productivity index (PI) and Farm Business Farm Management (FBFM) farmer-reported forage yields. This provided another method to check the model`s predicted yields against farmer-reported (FBFM) yields. Composite forage estimates were obtained from the mean of the 1990 s predicted yields, 1990 s established yields, and the farmer reported (FBFM) yields...|$|R
40|$|In Switzerland, carrion crows {{can cause}} {{considerable}} damage to sprouting corn fields when feeding on the germinated corn. I tried {{to evaluate a}} method to prevent these damages. The use of species-specific distress calls, {{for the first time}} described by Frings and Jumber (1954), seemed to be the most promising method. Agronomes and biologists have applied it in field studies to several different bird species causing damage in agriculture and on airports (e. g., Gramet, 1962; Brough, 1968). However, the literature either describes single actions or several different scaring devices being used together. To be able to judge the method, quantitative information about reduction of damage, habituation, and some practical information about the construction of an effective apparatus was needed. Distress calls proved to be a very effective method to keep carrion crows from sprouting corn fields, while suspended bodies of dead crows had no scaring effect. With distress calls, the chosen intervals of 25 minutes with 20 - 30 seconds broadcasting proved to be appropriate. Among the factors influencing crow damage on corn fields, the most important was extreme <b>wetness.</b> Another <b>factor</b> of importance was the date of sprouting of the plants. A possible {{reason for this is that}} earlier in the year crows find less food, which causes them to search the ground and forage on all possible sources; open arable land is frequently visited as it offers much insect food...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the annual}} {{diameter}} growth of trees {{is vital for}} assessing site suitability in terms of potential timber yield, the effects of climatic and topographic factors on this variable are poorly understood. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop a tree-level radial growth model incorporating topographic and climatic factors for four major temperate tree species [red pine (Pinus densiflora), oak (Quercus spp.), Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), and Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) ] in South Korea. The model was developed and then validated using increment cores sampled from permanent plots in the Korean National Forest Inventory country wide. The Standard Growth (SG) of each increment core, which eliminated the effect of tree age on radial growth, was derived using a SG model. Spatial autocorrelation was detected for the SGs of every species, but not for the original radial growth data. The results showed that using the SG model to standardize radial growth for age was successful for explaining the impact of topographic and climatic factors on radial growth. The influence of climatic (warmth index and precipitation effectiveness index) and topographic (topographic <b>wetness</b> index) <b>factors</b> on the SG of each species was evaluated by the estimated SG (eSG) model. Results show that for all species each variable was correlated to SG. The mean R 2 of the final radial growth model for red pine, oak, Japanese larch, and Korean pine during 2001 – 2009 were estimated to be 0. 71, 0. 73, 0. 67, and 0. 65, respectively. In addition, for every tree species the time sequence of estimated annual radial growth exhibited similar characteristics to that of the observed annual radial growth on an individual tree scale. Thus, this growth model can contribute to an understanding of the impacts of topographic and climatic factors on tree radial growth and predict the annual growth changes of major tree species in South Korea, given climate change...|$|R
40|$|Certification {{regulations}} require safe flight under icing conditions, therefore, ice protec-tion on {{aircraft wings}} and horizontal stabilizers {{will be necessary}} if critical aerodynamic performance degradation is to be avoided. The present paper developed a numerical code for prediction of heat and mass transfer in two-phase flow around aeronautical airfoils. These systems are equipped with thermal anti-ice systems {{that are designed to}} keep the surface free of ice as much as possible. The code is able to estimate the temperatures and runback water around the airfoil surface due implementation of heat transfer submodels in a baseline thermal anti-ice model: 1) it estimated the airfoil surface <b>wetness</b> <b>factor</b> by means of a runback water film and rivulets pattern flow models; 2) it evaluated the lami-nar and turbulent boundary layers with pressure gradient and laminar-turbulent transition over non-isothermal and permeable airfoil surfaces by performing integral and differential boundary layer analysis; and 3) it predicted the onset position and length of the laminar-turbulent transition region with pressure gradient and turbulence level effects. The work followed a validation and verification process during the numerical code development. All submodels results were separately verified against experimental data. The numerical re-sults of the thermal performance of the airfoil with the anti-ice baseline model, plus the present contributions, were validated against experimental data of an electrically heate...|$|E
40|$|Strong {{irreversible}} adsorptive monolayer {{growth of}} the surface (Pt=O→ 1), out of the reversible primary (Pt−OH→ 0) oxides, imposes typical highly pronounced reaction polarization, and that way prevents, at least partially, the reversible electrocatalytic properties and behavior of even all plain and non-interactive supported noble metals (Pt, Pt/C) for oxygen electrode reactions, within closed loop of potentiodynamic spectra between hydrogen and oxygen evolving limits. Substantially quite another type of assembly afford nanostructured hyper-d-electronic-metals (Pt,Au,Ru), interactive grafted upon hypo-d-(f) -oxide supports, in particular of mixed and higher alter-valence values (W,Mo,Ta,Nb), well and for longer known in heterogeneous catalysis as SMSI (Strong Metal-Support Interaction, the ones of strongest in the entire chemistry). The most promising being Magneli phases (MPs, TinO(2 n− 1), or Ti 4 O 7 in average, and as the optimum in catalytic activity), which arise after simple thermal recrystallization (pure entropy change contribution) yield effect, out of anatase and/or rutile titania (TiO 2). The main accompanying achievements of substantial significance then have been: (i) Prevailing percentage in spontaneous adsorptive dissociation of molecular water upon hypo-d-(f) -oxide surfaces, or the corresponding latent storage and spillover of the yielding primary oxides (Pt−OH); (ii) Extra high stability MPs, (Plate type electrodes of MPs are straightforward employed in industrial chlorate cell production, and/or Li-batteries); (iii) Spontaneously adsorptive dissociated water molecules (or, hydroxide ions), then undergo membrane type ionic transfer all along hypo-d-(f) -oxide supports, until approaching catalytic metal surface, when the latter takes the prevailing amount of electron charge, and that way creates the primary oxide dipole species (Pt−OH); (iv) these undergo spillover by repulsion upon metallic, hypo-d-(f) -oxide and even over the suboxide MPs surfaces; (v) while the Magneli phases themselves feature a rather high n-type electron conductivity (up to and even above 1, 000 S/cm). The <b>wetness</b> impact <b>factor</b> and effect have been introduced as the lowest threshold level associated with the Pt−OH (Au−OH), bellow {{which there is no}} (electro) catalytic oxidation reaction taking place, such as the CO tolerance. The overall result of the present study has then been the development and achievement of the reversible electrocatalysts for the oxygen electrode reactions (ORR, OER), primarily for L&MT PEMFCs.

40|$|AbstractOffshore {{operational}} availability {{was investigated}} {{for the proposed}} handling system consisting of the carrier vessel equipped with dynamic positioning capability, on-board manual operation of picking-up the sea-surface float connected to the upstream end of the flexible riser pipe laid-dawn on sea floor. An offshore site was selected to collect the oceanographic off {{the southern part of}} Japan facing to the Pacific Ocean. The response amplitude operator of the proposed CO 2 carrier vessel was calculated based on 3 -D Singularity Distribution Method. Based on the result of the interview survey with captains of research vessels which showed that for offshore operations a vessel's pitch motion and service deck <b>wetness</b> are dominant <b>factors</b> which define a vessel's operational availability, the RAO of the pitch and relative wave elevation was evaluated. The hull motions and the relative wave elevation in unidirectional irregular waves and in multidirectional irregular waves were calculated by a conventional method based on the seakeeping theory using the RAOs, the wave spectrum and the directional wave spectrum. Under the assumption that the operational availability of the proposed CO 2 carrier vessel is constrained by the pitch motion and the service deck wetness, the allowable upper limit values of the significant wave height were calculated by a conventional method based on the sea keeping theorem using the 1 / 10 maximum expected response value of pitch motion and the relative wave elevation evaluated in the above-mentioned calculation. The threshold value of operation availability was set at the pitch of 3. 0 degrees and the relative wave elevation at the freeboard to the service deck, based on the result of the interview survey with captains of research vessels. Finally, the overall operational availability was estimated, {{on the assumption that the}} threshold value of operation availability was set at the pitch of 3. 0 degrees and the relative wave elevation at the freeboard to the service deck. We concluded that the operational availability of the proposed CO 2 carrier vessel reaches a target value of nearly 90 % for both full year and four seasons in the case that freeboard of service deck for offshore buoy picking-up operations set greater than 2. 3 m as a service platform...|$|R
40|$|Os níveis de incidência e severidade de sintomas das doenças resultam da interação hospedeiro-patógeno-ambiente. Nesse contexto, a favorabilidade do ambiente, em particular, depende do nível de umidade, intensidade de radiação solar, luminosidade e molhamento foliar, dentre outros fatores. Por outro lado, a {{magnitude}} de expressão desses fatores é dependente do ciclo e porte das plantas, e possivelmente, também, do alinhamento de plantio. No presente estudo, foi avaliada a influência dos alinhamentos de plantio N-S, L-O, NE-SO E NO-SE no desempenho agronômico de plantas de laranjas 'Natal'e 'Valência', assim como na severidade de sintomas da mancha-preta-dos-citros (MPC), causada por Guignardia citricarpa. Para tal, foram selecionadas cinco propriedades distribuídas ao longo do cinturão citrícola paulista, de talhões semelhantes, a partir das quais foram coletadas amostras de 50 frutos, em dez plantas de mesma linha, da região central dos mesmos. Tais frutos foram levados para laboratórios e analisados quanto aos níveis de severidade de sintomas da MPC, produção e qualidade do suco. Constatouse que os frutos oriundos de pomares implantados no alinhamento N-S apresentavam menores níveis de severidade da doença, enquanto no alinhamento NE-SO, os mais elevados. Propriedades localizadas mais ao sul do Estado de São Paulo apresentaram menores níveis de doença, provavelmente em consequência da ocorrência recente da doença em tais áreas. Em relação à produção, os alinhamentos de plantio N-S e L-O proporcionaram maior número de frutos por planta, assim como quanto ao número de caixas por planta. Por outro lado, a menor produção foi verificada nos alinhamentos NO-SE. Em relação à qualidade do suco, não foi possível estabelecer um padrão definido em termos de ratio e ºBrix e os respectivos alinhamentos de plantio. Foi verificado que os valores de ratio foram menores nos frutos de pomares localizados mais ao sul do Estado, de maiores latitudes. The levels of incidence {{and severity of}} disease symptoms {{are a result of}} the host-pathogenenvironment integration. in this context, a favorable environment, in particular, depends on the level of humidity, intensity of solar radiation, luminosity and leaf <b>wetness</b> among other <b>factors.</b> on the other side, the magnitudes of these factors' expressions are dependent upon the plant's cycle and size, and possibly the crop alignment as well. In the present study, five properties distributed along the citrus agricultural belt of São Paulo were selected. With similar orchards and crop orientation going north-south, east-west, northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast, from which samples of 50 fruits from ten plants of the same central tree line were collected. These fruits were taken to a laboratory and analyzed for severity levels of citrus black spot (Guignardia citricarpa), production and juice quality. it was concluded that the fruits from crops in the east-west orientation presented lower symptom severity, while the north-south orientation, had the highest levels. Also, the farms located further south of São Paulo state, showed lower levels of the disease, probably {{due to the fact that}} such areas have shorter periods of disease occurrences. in relation to production, the north-south and east-west crop orientations produced the highest amount of boxes per plant, while the northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest had the lowest production levels. As for the juice quality, there was no concluding data to establish a defined standard in terms of ratio and ºBrix on the respective crop alignment. The relation between the latitude and ratio value was declared to be consistently lower in citrus orchards located further south in the state of Sao Paulo...|$|R
40|$|Submitted to the Division of Environmental Science and Technology, In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science In the Graduate School of Bioresources University of Mie Mie Prefecture, JapanAfghanistan, as a dry country, is {{characterized}} by extremes of climate and weather that can be counted as continental climate. Favorable climate for those areas that agricultural products form the firs source of income is important. Agriculture as a main source of income in Afghanistan has been facing challenges since decades. Water scarcity is the extreme challenges that threatening the country so far. Total available water is 75, 000, 000, 000 m 3 of which 57, 000, 000, 000 m 3 is unused. This information shows that, still Afghanistan is not self-sufficient for its water needs. The spatial distribution of water availability is not equal in Afghanistan among the regions. The western region is the most exposed place on water shortage. Western region consist Farah, Ghour, Badghis and Herat provinces where {{is characterized}} with semi-arid climate that has low precipitation and high evaporation. Between all the factors which adversely affect the weather condition is strong wind. Strong winds are locally known as “ 120 day winds” usually begin in July and go on until September with a great force 7 m/s. The prevailing winds come from the north at almost 7. 5 m/s all summer. North winds occur 40 - 45 {{percent of the time}} in June-August and 30 % of the time in September. Peak gusts reached almost 25 m/s. The great impact of wind velocity is increasing evapotranspiration (ET) which can have profound implications for hydrologic processes and agricultural crop performance. In this study, by examining the impact of metrological factors on evaporation process, the relationship of the wind intensity with evaporation is examined using six common evaporation models with aim for discovering the best method for estimating the evapotranspiration which has the most accuracy and is adaptable in the area. Therefore, the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves methods are confirmed the most accurate and adaptable methods for estimating the evapotranspiration in the west region. In regards to the weather conditions and geographical statues, the most potential places in terms of <b>wetness</b> and hotness <b>factors</b> is presented in Afghanistan. For this purpose, favorable areas where having high potential for Agriculture are indicated by a 2 D map. Time-series reference evapotranspiration (ET 0) data is analyzed for both windy and nonwindy seasons using the Penman?Monteith equation to determine seasonal differences in ET 0. Therefore, ET 0 is determined to be significantly influenced by the synergistic effect of wind velocity and vapor pressure deficit. The surrounding another provinces are investigated with aim for finding the difference from Herat in regards of the wind velocity. It’s confirmed that due to the large differentials of wind velocity between two provinces which are located mutually near, it’s difficult to characterize the areas where having the strong winds. By determining the hourly ET 0 during the “ 120 -Day Winds” and non-windy season, the wind velocity is found higher at daytime than the nighttime. Furthermore, the months June until September has been found as windy season which causes the higher daily evapotranspiration, almost more than 10 mm/day in west region. Hence, the crops which their growing season coincide with windy season, consume more water. Similarly, in a simulation case in which wind velocity is considered zero, the ET 0 rate has been found two times lower...|$|R
