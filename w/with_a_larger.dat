5|$|After later {{studies were}} {{conducted}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> number of birds, the advisories were revised and another was added for cinnamon teal.

5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> caliber than a machine gun, but {{smaller than that}} of a field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of a machine gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station was}} opened on 10 October 1934, when the municipally owned company Akersbanerne had {{completed}} the Sognsvann Line from Majorstuen to Sognsvann. Residential areas at Sogn, Tåsen and Berg were starting to grow, in pace <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> suburban development plan. Akersbanerne bought new property along the line, upon which new houses were to be designed by the Norwegian architect Kristofer Lange (1886–1977).|$|E

5|$|Early in production, {{the radar}} was {{upgraded}} to the Westinghouse AN/APQ-72, an AN-APG-50 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility {{and make the}} rear cockpit less claustrophobic.

5|$|Florida {{was fitted}} {{experimentally}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> bridge than was then standard, to house both ship and fire control personnel under armor, while Utah received a heavily armored fire-control tower atop a standard-sized bridge. The former proved especially successful, {{to the point}} that when a larger armored fire-control tower and standard bridge was proposed for the Nevada class, it was rejected in favor of a roomier bridge like that of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{termination}} of the Army's evaluation, Radioplane, as a private venture, conducted an improvement program for the RP-77D, fitting the aircraft <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> wing, along with other modifications that improved {{the performance of the}} drone. However these improvements were insufficient to produce a renewed interest from the Army.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} the Königsbergs was {{prepared}} in 1913. The design was an incremental improvement over the previous , <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> hull and greater displacement, but with the same armament, speed, and armor protection. By 1916, thirteen German light cruisers had {{been lost in the}} course of World War I; after they were commissioned, the ships of the Königsberg class took the names of four of these lost cruisers.|$|E

40|$|A {{parallel}} {{computational method}} SDPARA-C is presented for SDPs (semidefinite programs). It combines two methods SDPARA and SDPA-C {{proposed by the}} authors who developed a software package SDPA. SDPARA is a parallel implementation of SDPA and it features parallel computation {{of the elements of}} the Schur complement equation system and a parallel Cholesky factorization of its coefficient matrix. SDPARA can effectively solve SDPs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of equality constraints, however, it does not solve SDPs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> scale matrix variable with similar effectiveness. SDPA-C is a primal-dual interior-point method using the positive definite matrix completion technique by Fukuda et al, and it performs effectively <b>with</b> SDPs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> scale matrix variable, but not <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of equality constraints. SDPARA-C benefits from the strong performance of each of the two methods. Furthermore, SDPARA-C is designed to attain a high scalability by considering most of the expensive computations involved in the primal-dual interior-point method. Numerical experiments with the three parallel software packages SDPARA-C, SDPARA and PDSDP by Benson show that SDPARA-C efficiently solve SDPs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> scale matrix variable as well as <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of equality constraints <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small amount of memory...|$|R

5|$|The unit {{structure}} of the Auxilia also differed from the Latin alae, which were like legions <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> cavalry arm. Augustus however organised the Auxilia into regiments the size of cohorts (a tenth the size of legions), due to the much greater flexibility of the smaller unit size. Further, the regiments were of three types: ala (cavalry), cohors (peditata) (infantry) and cohors equitata (mixed cavalry/infantry).|$|E

5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier and {{more powerful than the}} Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned for use in the Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} five years at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} an invitation from the church and town of Hampton, then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E
