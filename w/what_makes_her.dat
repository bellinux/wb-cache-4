In a 1983 interview with literature critic Claudia Tate, Angelou calls her books autobiographies, and later acknowledges that she follows the slave narrative tradition of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying 'I' meaning 'we'". Lupton compares The Heart of a Woman with other autobiographies, and states {{that for the first}} time in Angelou's series, she is able to present herself as a model for successful living. However, Angelou's [...] "woman's heart"—her perspective as a woman with concerns about her self-esteem and the conflicts with her lovers and her son—is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> autobiography different. Angelou's feelings as described in The Heart of a Woman, which Lupton calls Angelou's [...] "most introspective" [...] book, are what dictates the book's form.|$|E

500|$|P.exclamans {{lives in}} a {{hierarchical}} society with one queen that lays the eggs. However, all of the females have the same morphology {{and they all have}} the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary (queen death, queen migration). Since the queen has the same morphology {{as the rest of the}} workers in the colony, this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned and <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> special. Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose, fructose and trehalose than workers, leading to higher cryoprotectant levels. P.exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant, which work by increasing the solute concentration in cells. This results in a greater survivability in colder weather. It was found that queens have a 76% survival rate in [...] weather compared to 17% survival of the workers over a 15-day test period. The queens also have a 0.5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies. This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season. The queens seem to be the only ones capable of diapause.|$|E

Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra rated the album three stars and wrote: [...] "Despite the Disney machine's presence, Here We Go Again doesn't rely too heavily on 'tween trends, instead relying on Lovato's penchant for rock-drama and teaming her with a slew of older, established acts." [...] Kerri Mason of Billboard praised the album for not relying heavily on production and Auto-Tune, calling Lovato [...] "a natural talent who could really take flight after outgrowing Disney". Mason wrote that the album includes [...] "quiet surprises" [...] and potential hits, particularly praising the title track and [...] "Catch Me". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News rated Here We Go Again {{two and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Unlike so many of her Disney-fied peers, Lovato can really sing, and part of <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> sophomore effort appealing is the lack of in-studio vocal manipulation."

500|$|Seldom hesitating to use {{herself as}} the butt of her own jokes, Fey is also well known for {{practicing}} self-deprecating humor, as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in 30 Rock. In an article ranking Fey's six greatest jokes, David Renshaw of The Guardian wrote that the performer's work continues to feature her [...] "trademark mix of snark, self-deprecation and pop-culture smarts." [...] Fey's self-deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of The Atlantic to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Diller's successor because of their similar humor. Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Fey's use of self-deprecating humor, {{and its effect on}} women as a female comic; while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Fey's performance in 30 Rock because [...] "I'm torn between being sad that she apparently doesn't see [...] in herself and being pissed off that she's reinforcing the idea that having brown hair, glasses, and a figure that's maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly", Jessica G. of Jezebel defended the actress, writing that Fey's performance is [...] "supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy." [...] Writing that Harding misunderstood Fey's intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation [...] "is precisely <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> relatable", elaborating that [...] " [...] have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect." [...] Sophie Caldecott of Verily defended Fey's modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: [...] "She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if that’s the most interesting thing about us ... Her comic persona on 30 Rock, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them." [...] Caldecott concluded, [...] "In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy you to find a good male comedian who isn’t a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one." [...] Observing that Fey's material lacks [...] "whining", Gina Barreca of the Hartford Courant wrote that Fey's comedy [...] "is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a punching bag for insults." [...] Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to [...] "opt out" [...] of the culture of demanding apologies.|$|E
500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey.

Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles: she exhibits both [...] "masculine" [...] and [...] "feminine" [...] traits equally. Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency: [...] "Katniss is a fantasy figure, but partly <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> powerful—and, I suspect, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> so important to a lot of girls and women—is that she's one of the truest feeling, most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while. She isn't passive, she isn't weak, and she isn't some random girl. She's active, she's strong and she's the girl who motivates the story." [...] Similarly, Shelley Bridgeman of The New Zealand Herald wrote that because the characteristics of [...] "athleticism, strength, courageousness and prowess at hunting" [...] are not given to a male protagonist, but to Katniss, her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless. Mahvesh Murad of The Express Tribune said that the film's triumph is [...] "a young female protagonist with agency", comparing her with Joss Whedon's Buffy Summers.|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing her}} friend Danielle Jones, Stacey began acting strangely in May 2009, and the {{character}} has {{to come to terms}} with the prospect that, like her mother, she also suffers from bipolar disorder. The storyline was developed as of the BBC's Headroom campaign, which aims to encourage people to look after their mental wellbeing. Series Consultant Simon Ashdown had been developing the storyline for about a year. To accurately reflect the issue, EastEnders worked closely with various charities such as Mind and MDF The BiPolar Organisation, medical practitioners and bipolar sufferers when researching the storyline. The story was moulded around what Stacey would do in that situation and what the research led the team to believe was the most truthful way events would develop. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that the initial buildup of the storyline was an extension of how the character has always been, [...] "a character of highs and lows, of great passions and dark moods," [...] but these highs and lows would become more contrasted, and viewers would realise that Stacey's mood is more complex than just being upset over her losses, adding, [...] "It's the beginning of us getting to really know and understand who Stacey is and <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> behave the way she does."

Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a [...] "high risk" [...] style, is balanced in part by her serve, which most say is the greatest in women's tennis history.
