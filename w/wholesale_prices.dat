Pass-through is also asymmetric with respect to the magnitude of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> change, with the magnitude affecting the response to <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> increases but not decreases. Finally, we show that covariates such as private label versus national brand, 99 -cent price endings, and the time since the last <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> change have a much stronger impact on the first stage of the decision process (i. e., whether to change the regular retail price) than on the second stage (i. e., how much to change the regular retail price) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a one-population (indirect) evolutionary game {{model of a}} supply chain with one manufacturer/supplier and many (a sufficiently large number of) retailers to study how the retailer's marketing objective depends on the <b>wholesale</b> <b>price,</b> its observability, the error probability of the observed result on the rival's preference, the market scale and the retailer's bargaining power. This paper also presents an algorithm for computing the optimal <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> of the manufacturer. We find that the profit (revenue) maximization behavior is an evolutionarily stable marketing strategy if the <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> is sufficiently high (low). Given an appropriate <b>wholesale</b> <b>price,</b> the revenue maximization behavior coexists with the profit maximization behavior in the retailers' population. The larger the market scale, the stronger the motivation of the retailer to take profit maximization behavior due to a higher <b>wholesale</b> <b>price.</b> The cross effects of the retailer's reservation payoff and the other factors {{should be considered in}} the decision process.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose a {{two-stage}} game, where an incumbent {{is forced to}} share its network facilities with an entrant, competing in investment levels in the first-stage and in prices on the second stage. All the investments are applied in network facilities innovation. The incumbent receives a <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> (transfer), paid by the entrant, by each entrant's user. The regulator defines ex-ante that <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> {{as a function of}} the investment level done by each operator. Regulators need to manage a trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency, hence, in order to balance these two efficiencies, the <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> increases (decreases) with the incumbent's (entrant's) investment. I show that with the proposed <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> indexed to the investment level of each operator it is possible to achieve socially efficient investment levels keeping significant price competition intensity vis-à-vis a <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> that is not indexed to each operator’s investment...|$|R

25|$|The {{company has}} several {{advantages}} in its dealings in export markets. First, its costs are {{not affected by}} the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices, since hydropower requires no fuel.

Third, the Quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating, unlike most neighboring systems, where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer, due to the air conditioning needs of homes and offices.|$|E
30|$|However, a low <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> might {{induce the}} buyer to order larger amounts which {{compensate}} {{the unwillingness of}} the supplier to inflate the order enough to reach the supply chain optimum.

40|$|Members of {{a supply}} chain often make profit comparisons. A {{retailer}} exhibits peer-induced fairness concerns when his own profit is behind that of a peer retailer interacting with the same supplier. In addition, a retailer exhibits distributional fairness concerns when his supplier’s share of total profit is disproportionately larger than his own. While existing research focuses exclusively on distributional fairness concerns, this paper investigates how both types of fairness concerns might interact and influence economic outcomes in {{a supply chain}}. We consider a setting where a supplier sells an identical product through 2 independent retailers, each serving his own market. The supplier sequentially offers each retailer a linear <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> contract, and each retailer must choose his own retail price if he accepts the supplier’s <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> offer. The second retailer observes a noisy signal of the first <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> offer and this information may influence his decisions. We show that: (i) the first <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> offer {{is lower than the}} standard <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> offer in the absence of fairness concerns, (ii) the second <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> is higher than the first <b>wholesale</b> <b>price,</b> and (iii) the second retailer makes a lower profit and has a lower share of the total supply chain profit than the first retailer. We run controlled experiments with subjects motivated by substantial monetary incentives and show that subject behaviors are consistent with the model predictions. Structural estimation on the data suggests that peer-induced fairness is more salient than distributional fairness...|$|R

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be used}} in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have its limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments {{it is often difficult to}} fully apply Bayesian {{decision theory}} to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.|$|E
25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (<b>wholesale)</b> <b>prices</b> or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{government}} reduced its total spending, it managed {{to support a}} new public works program to provide temporary employment and to direct more resources to rural producers as intended in its program for structural change. Three lines of policy helped especially to raise rural incomes. The first was to use generous guaranteed prices for key food products. The second was to provide greatly increased agricultural credit, financed essentially by credit from the Central Bank. The third was to exempt most of the non-guaranteed agricultural prices from controls, allowing their prices to rise sharply relative to those of industrial products from the modern sector. From July 1985 to December 1986, prices {{of goods and services}} not under control increased more than three times as much as those under control. <b>Wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> in manufacturing increased 26 percent, but those for agricultural products increased 142 percent.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple supply-chain contract {{in which a}} manufacturer sells to a retailer facing a newsvendor problem and the lone contract parameter is a <b>wholesale</b> <b>price.</b> We develop a mild restriction satisfied by many common distributions that assures that the manufacturer's problem is readily amenable to analysis. The manufacturer's profit and sales quantity increase with market size, but the resulting <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> depends on how the market grows. For the cases we consider, we identify relative variability (i. e., the coefficient of variation) as key: As relative variability decreases, the retailer's price sensitivity decreases, the <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> increases, the decentralized system becomes more efficient (i. e., captures {{a greater share of}} potential profit), and the manufacturer's share of realized profit increases. Decreasing relative variability, however, may leave the retailer severely disadvantaged as the higher <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> reduces his profitability. We explore factors that may lead the manufacturer to set a <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> below that which would maximize her profit, concentrating on retailer participation in forecasting and retailer power. As these and other considerations can result in a <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> below what we initially suggest, our base model represents a worst-case analysis of supply-chain performance.

25|$|The {{competitive}} market {{did not actually}} open until May 2002. Participation in the retail market was voluntary, with customers having the option of entering into contracts or rates being set in the five-minute spot market. Retail consumers were also free to enter fixed-rate contracts. For those that opted out of the contract option, electricity rates passed through a smoothed spot market price. When the market opened in May, <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> averaged 3.01 cents per kWh. For a number of reasons, however, including an especially hot summer, a reduction in domestic generating capacity, and an increasing reliance on a limited import capacity, prices began to rise sharply. In July, average wholesale price was 6.2 cents per kWh. Under surmounting pressure from consumers, the government adopted the Electricity Pricing, Conservation and Supply (EPCS) Act in December 2002. The legislation capped retail prices at 4.3 cents per kWh and Ontario Power Generation (the successor of Ontario Hydro's electricity generation division) was to provide customers with a rebate for 100% of all electricity charges above that mark, retroactive to the market opening and continuing until 1 May 2006. Transmission and distribution rates were also frozen at their existing levels and would remain unchanged until 1 May 2006. The net result was a complete cessation of new investment in generation capacity and a significant cutback in new investment in transmission and distribution.|$|E

40|$|Firms {{can enhance}} the {{reliability}} of their supply through process improvement and overproduction. In decentralized supply chains, however, these mitigating actions may be the supplier's responsibility yet are often not contractible. We show that <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> contracts, despite their simplicity, can perform well in inducing reliable supply, and we identify when and why they perform well. This could explain {{the widespread use of}} <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> contracts in business settings with unreliable supply. In particular, we investigate how the performance of <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> contracts depends on the interplay between the nature of supply risk and the type of procurement process. Supply risk is classified as random capacity when events such as labor strike disrupt the firm's ability to produce, or as random yield when manufacturing defects result in yield losses. The procurement process is classified as control when the buyer determines the production quantity, or as delegation when instead the supplier does. Analyzing the four possible combinations, we find that for random capacity, irrespective of the procurement process type, contract performance monotonically increases with the supplier's bargaining power; thus, <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> contracts perform well when the supplier is powerful. However, this monotonic trend is reversed for random yield with control: in that case, <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> contracts perform well when instead the buyer is powerful.
