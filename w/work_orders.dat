The men were too much fatigued, and it was too dark to think of pushing matters any further that night; and it was very questionable whether they could have been got to <b>work.</b> <b>Orders</b> were consequently given for all hands to turn in, the captain, relieved by Don Juan and Jack Tier, having arranged to keep the watches of the night.|$|E

Other <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> that can be created using inventory management software include reverse <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> and auto <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> Manufacturers also use inventory management software for tracking assets, receiving new inventory and additional tasks businesses in other industries use it for.|$|E

40|$|Optimizing {{combinations}} of placements of parts, known as markers, {{is an important}} preparatory step in order-based industrial production of clothes. Given a <b>work</b> <b>order</b> {{in the form of}} a matrix of pieces in size numbers and designs, the task is to find a list of {{combinations of}} size numbers to complete the <b>work</b> <b>order.</b> The outcome of this step influences the number of cut out pieces, the amount of material used in the production phase, and the speed of the <b>work</b> <b>order</b> processing. The optimization task is demanding since a number of factors affect production costs and several conflicting criteria can be involved in marker assessment. We consider minimum number of markers per <b>work</b> <b>order</b> as an optimization criterion and transform the problem into the knapsack problem which is then solved with several variants of an evolutionary algorithm. Numerical experiments are performed on real problem instances from industrial clothes production and the results compare favorably with those produced by the algorithm regularly used in practice...|$|R
