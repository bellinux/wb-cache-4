He would write some forty books throughout his life. They are typified by Anti-Struwwwelpeter ("Anti-Strawpeter," [...] a parody of Heinrich Hoffman's popular German children's book, Struwwelpeter), Die Schoepfung (Waechter's re-telling of Biblical creation), and Der Kronenklauer ("The Crown Snatchers," [...] an anti-authoritarian fable).|$|E

5000|$|Harmony {{returns in}} the tenth issue of Buffy season 10 in an issue titled [...] "Day Off (Harmony In My Head)." [...] The Scoobies have taken {{residence}} in San Francisco and are tasked with writing {{the rules of}} the new magic in the world by using the pages of Buffy's Vampyr book. They invite several species from the mystical world as lobbyists to consider when creating the rules. Buffy is annoyed when Harmony shows up representing the older type vampires but is happy to see Clem is with her. Buffy is also displeased the new breed of vampires have selected a vampire named Vicki as their representative because Vicki previously tried to kill her. The new breed is immune to sunlight and can shape-shift. Harmony creates a compromise; the new breed will follow her rules for peaceful interaction with humans and the Scoobies can create a rule so the new breed will be unable to shape-shift in the daylight. Harmony then visits Spike who apologizes for using her in London but she doesn't care as she felt she was using him as payback for the way he dumped her in Sunnydale. Harmony knocks Spike out and intends to have Clem <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> to make her loved by everyone in the world, and for Buffy, Spike and Angel to finally make peace with each other and agree to a marriage between all three of them. Clem does not do this as the book may hurt her due to its wish fulfillment often being twisted like the Monkey's paw. Spike takes back the book and kicks them both out. However, Clem did write one thing down for Harmony, unicorns are now real. She next appears in the twenty-first issue: [...] "In Pieces on the Ground, Part I." [...] Demon invasions have become a global problem, the Scooby Gang is reluctantly working with the human military to battle this, but they also need the strength and numbers of both breeds of vampires. With Harmony leading the old breed and Vicki the new one, they have Buffy & Spike compete in trials of combat to win the vampires' alliance. While the other one fights, Harmony taunts Spike and Vicki taunts Buffy about the relationship insecurities they have. With the vampires' loyalty won, Buffy & Spike leave rattled; while Harmony and Vicki congratulate each other for what they did.|$|E
