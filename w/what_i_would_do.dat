25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do...</b> at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
2500|$|At a Cannes press conference, {{after the}} {{identity}} of the donor was revealed, Moore said: [...] "I had to ask myself, 'Would you write this check if this wasn't in the film?' I decided this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> and what I should do, {{and this is the way}} I want Americans to live." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Stewart owned a [...] "willful but beloved" [...] golden {{retriever}} named Beau, {{of whom he}} was extremely fond. Beau slept {{in the corner of}} Stewart's bedroom, but would often crawl onto the bed between Stewart and his wife Gloria. Stewart recalled, [...] "he was up there because he wanted me to pat his head, so that’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> Somehow, my touching his hair made him happier, and just the feeling of him laying against me helped me sleep better." ...|$|E

He joined the Communist Party, until the {{invasion}} of Poland by the Soviet Army in September 1939. [...] Formerly classified UK security service papers reveal that Wilkins came under suspicion of leaking atomic secrets. The files, released in August 2010, indicate surveillance of Wilkins ended by 1953. [...] "After the war I wondered <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> as I was very disgusted with the dropping of two bombs on civilian centres in Japan," [...] he told Britain's Encounter radio program in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|The limited series Agents of Atlas #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007) {{was set in}} {{the present}} day and {{likewise}} set in mainstream continuity. The series emerged from what writer Parker called [...] "a huge editorial hunch" [...] at Marvel, and said {{the revival of the}} characters [...] "is something that [...] Mark Paniccia was looking at and [...] thought specifically of me, and asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with it". Paniccia says the idea came to him when he picked up a copy of the What if? story and found the cover [...] "intriguing; it instantly tickles the nostalgia bone".|$|E
2500|$|Perry {{stated that}} his foreign aid budget would start at $0 for all countries, {{including}} Israel. Bachmann and Santorum criticised him for suggesting that Pakistan should get no aid at all, with Santorum saying [...] "we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend. They must be our friend, {{and we must}} engage them as friends". Bachmann drew raised eyebrows for her claim that China's economy was growing because of its lack of a social safety net, saying [...] "If you look at China, they don't have food stamps. They don't have the modern welfare state, and China's growing... And so <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{is look at the}} programs that LBJ gave us with the Great Society and they'd be gone." ...|$|E

In a 1997 interview, Cetera {{said that he had}} to remake the three Chicago songs because Chicago band members refused to release the master recordings for River North Records to use for this album. [...] Although Cetera was at first reluctant to revisit his Chicago material, he soon {{had a change of heart}} and said, I viewed them as <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with the songs if they were new today. Additionally, this is the first of Cetera's solo albums to feature [...] "After All", his 1989 number six duet with Cher from the soundtrack of the movie Chances Are.|$|E

Michael O'Connell and Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter {{thought the}} {{performance}} was nostalgic, {{and concluded that}} [...] "the two can also still give a pretty good live performance." [...] A reviewer of Rap-Up said that Monica and Brandy [...] "put their powerful pipes on display" [...] on the presentation. The singers were also going to perform the track on Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Party in 2012, along with [...] "The Boy is Mine". When asked about the performance, Brandy revealed that she was scared, [...] "I'm just scared of everybody in that room. I think that's why it's {{going to be a}} really cool performance because I do a little bit better when I'm afraid." [...] Monica, on the other hand, revealed that she [...] "don't get nervous. I thank God for that because I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if I did." [...] However, following Houston's passing, the performance was cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer {{came into the room}} and sat on the table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997 {{the band}} {{recorded}} Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It {{is considered by}} many to be the best representation of their [...] "classic" [...] sound, and songs such as [...] "Lucky the Donkey," [...] "Do the Hustle," [...] "Lipstick" [...] and [...] "Perfect World" [...] became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band’s history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: [...] "oh, I was guilty [...] <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked." [...] Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.|$|E
2500|$|The {{role was}} {{originated}} on October 29, 1993, by eleven-year-old Jonathan Jackson. Rumors circulated that Jackson’s contract negotiations {{were not going}} well in 1996, and again in 1998, when Jackson responded that he was considering college and had given the series six months notice of his consideration in accordance with his contract. In January 1999, {{it was reported that}} the series had worked out a deal, and Jackson stated he had briefly extended his contract to allow the character's popular romance to continue. His contract allowed him to leave if he received a feature film role, and Jackson left in April, shooting pre-taped scenes that appeared through late May. Jackson explained to Soap Opera Weekly: [...] "I kind of feel that the fact of how much work they've given me this year, at this stage as an actor, they just maxed out quite a bit of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> for the show. And I'm at a better age now to go out. There are more projects for people my age or a little older than there were a few years ago. Hollywood's the kind of town where you kinda have to strike while the iron's hot." [...] Jackson's manager Tony Monziotti released the statement: [...] " [...] has told GH and made it very clear to me that he wants to periodically go back to GH. It's a question of if the storyline warrants it and they want him to come back; Jonathan would be more than happy to." [...] In early 2000, Jackson stated he would enjoy reprising the role but his schedule would not allow it. He suggested a short-term return that could coincide with the departure of co-star Rebecca Herbst (who plays Lucky's love interest Elizabeth Webber) should she not renew her contract, allowing for periodic returns from the couple later on. Although Herbst expressed interest, the show opted to keep the characters on canvas.|$|E
