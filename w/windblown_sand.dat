At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) {{and a pair of}} claws – show features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradziński. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not possible as the quarry had been filled by <b>windblown</b> <b>sand,</b> the quarry could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation.|$|E

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of <b>windblown</b> <b>sand</b> {{piled up}} in mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
25|$|The Sphinx is a {{monolith}} {{carved into}} the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area. The nummulitic limestone of the area consists of layers which offer differing resistance to erosion (mostly caused by wind and <b>windblown</b> <b>sand),</b> leading to the uneven degradation apparent in the Sphinx's body. The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock. The body of the lion up to its neck is fashioned from softer layers that have suffered considerable disintegration. The layer in which the head was sculpted is much harder.|$|E

Since the 1960s, multiple robotic spacecraft have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface. The planet has remained under observation by ground and space-based instruments across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The discovery of meteorites on Earth that originated on Mars has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet.|$|E

5000|$|The prehistoric dune is {{made from}} yellow, <b>windblown</b> <b>sands</b> lacking the red {{component}} of the sands {{on the west side}} of the Rock. It is made of the same sand that once formed part of a vast savanna of the late Pleistocene where Neanderthals hunted. The levant winds of prehistory continuously blew sand from this savanna westwards, accumulating against the eastern cliffs of the Rock, reaching from the base of the cliff right down to sea level (at that time there was no road where Sir Herbert Miles Road is today). The occasional rockfall from the precipice above added boulders to the dune so the formation seen today is a consolidated composite of rocks and <b>windblown</b> <b>sands.</b> The upper limits of the dune were scarped by the British garrison for two reasons - to avoid soldiers deserting the place and to prevent surprise attacks by Spanish troops. The Great Sand Dune was constantly shifting right up to the late 19th century when corrugated iron sheets were laid over the dune for the collection of rainwater. John White described this and the efforts to make it inaccessible:"The Eastern side of the hill consists of an immense sloping bank of whitish sand interspersed with huge fragments of rock, and reaching from the sea nearly to the summit of the rock in some parts not far from the Signal House, and the Middle-hill Guards. These parts were formerly accessible, which made it necessary to keep constant guards there, as well to prevent desertions from within as a surprise from without. Of late years, much labour has been bestowed in making all these parts more abrupt and difficult, yet it is still necessary to watch them, as there are always some hardy adventurers who will wantonly risk their lives down these perilous cliffs, either in attempting to desert or in search of flowers." ...|$|R

[...] He skipped across the sands toward the station, for he was going back with the down train, and vanished in a whirlwind of luggage and the fluttering of female skirts: in Jodhpur the women are baggage coolies. A level, drawling voice spoke from an inner room: [...] "'E's a bit upset. That's what 'e is! I remember when I was at Gworlior"--the rest of the story was lost, and the Englishman set to work to discover the nakedness of the dak-bungalow. For reasons which do not concern the public, it is made as bitterly uncomfortable as possible. The food is infamous, and the charges seem to be wilfully pitched about eighty per cent above the tariff, so that some portion of the bill, at least, may be paid without bloodshed, or the unseemly defilement of walls with the contents of drinking glasses. This is short-sighted policy, and it would, perhaps, be better to lower the prices and hide the tariff, and put a guard about the house to prevent jackal-molested donkeys from stampeding into the verandahs. But these be details. Jodhpur dak-bungalow is a merry, merry place, and any writer in search of new ground to locate a madly improbable story in, could not do better than study it diligently. In front lies sand, riddled with innumerable ant-holes, and beyond the sand the red sandstone wall of the city, and the Mahometan burying-ground that fringes it. Fragments of sandstone set on end mark the resting places of the Faithful, who are of no great account here. Above everything, a mark for miles around, towers the dun-red pile of the Fort which is also a Palace. This is set upon sandstone rock whose sharper features have been worn smooth by the wash of the <b>windblown</b> <b>sand.</b> It is as monstrous as anything in Dore's illustrations of the Contes Drolatiques and, wherever it wanders, the eye comes back at last to its fantastic bulk. There is no greenery on the rock, nothing but fierce sunlight or black shadow.

40|$|Many desert organisms exhibit convergence, {{and certain}} {{physical}} {{factors such as}} <b>windblown</b> <b>sands</b> have generated remarkably similar ecomorphs across divergent lineages. The burrowing geckos Colopus, Chondrodactylus and Palmatogecko occupy dune ecosystems in the Namib and Kalahari deserts of southwest Africa. Considered closely related, they share several putative synapomorphies, including reduced subdigital pads (toe pads) and spinose digital scales. Though recognized as part of Africa's ecologically diverse Pachydactylus Group, the burrowing geckos' precise phylogenetic affinities remain elusive. Convergent pedal modification provides a tenable alternative explaining the geckos' derived terrestriality and adaptation to Namib and Kalahari sands. We generated a molecular phylogeny for the Pachydactylus Group to examine evolutionary relationships among the burrowing geckos and infer historical patterns of pedal character change. Bayesian and parsimony analyses revealed all three burrowing genera to be deeply nested within Pachydactylus, each genus belonging to a separate clade. Strong support for these distinct clades indicates ecomorphological adaptations for burrowing have evolved independently {{three times in the}} southern Pachydactylus Group. We argue that the physical properties of Namib and Kalahari sands played a principal role in selecting for pedal similarity.

50|$|Because the Colorado River {{flowed through}} very flat terrain, {{the course of}} the river varied over a wide area, being {{periodically}} diverted in one direction or another by silt deposits remaining after floods. Sometimes the river flowed into the Gulf of California, as it does today (no longer flows into the Gulf of Mexico due to irrigation in the Imperial Valley and Mexicali Valley); other times it turned westward toward the Salton Sink. Each time the Salton Sink received the river flow, a large freshwater lake called Lake Cahuilla formed. The last Lake Cahuilla covered much of the Imperial, Coachella and Mexicali Valleys as late as 1450. The most popular theory holds that the Algodones Dunes were formed from <b>windblown</b> beach <b>sands</b> of Lake Cahuilla. The prevailing westerly and northwesterly winds carried the sand eastward from the old lake shore to their present location which continues to migrate southeast by approximately one foot per year.|$|R
2500|$|The {{common name}} sidewinder alludes to its unusual form of locomotion, which {{is thought to}} give it {{traction}} on <b>windblown</b> desert <b>sand,</b> but this peculiar locomotor specialization is used on any substrate over which the sidewinder can move rapidly. As its body progresses over loose sand, it forms a letter J-shaped impression, {{with the tip of}} the hook pointing in the direction of travel. Sidewinding is also the primary mode of locomotion in other desert sand dwellers, such as the horned adder (Bitis caudalis) and Peringuey's adder (Bitis peringueyi), but many other snakes can assume this form of locomotion when on slick substrates (e.g., mud flats). Sidewinder rattlesnakes can use sidewinding to ascend sandy slopes by increasing the portion of the body in contact with the sand to match the reduced yielding force of the inclined sand, allowing them to ascend up to the maximum possible sand slope without slip. [...] Implementing this control scheme in a Snakebot capable of sidewinding allowed the robot to replicate the success of the snakes.|$|R

Kurkar occurs on the shore as well as under the current sea level, on the continental shelf. There are three underwater sandstone ridges off the coast of Israel and two on land. The younger kurkar formations also build small islands or islets along the coast of Israel, Lebanon (at Sidon and near Tripoli), and Syria (Arwad). In the Gaza Strip, coastal plain kurkar deposits of medium to coarse-grained calcareous sandstone are characterized by crossbedding.|$|R

The problem is compounded further when moisture penetrates below the footings and reaches saturation in the winter months. When poorly graded sand with a high fines content is coupled with vibration (through earth tremors), liquefaction may occur and without proper precautions, this can lead to inadequate foundation design, more than expected settlement and eventual structural failure. Some sand deposits are highly contaminated with organic debris, leading to compressible and collapsible conditions. Little knowledge is locally available of liquefiable conditions in <b>windblown</b> dune <b>sand</b> and what long-term settlement can be expected. The Western Cape is not known as an area exposed to serious seismic activity, but an updated (and more locally applicable set of data) is needed to eliminate possible erroneous foundation design. Samples have been extracted from typical sandy sites in the Western Cape where <b>windblown</b> dune <b>sand</b> is evident. Laboratory tests have been carried out on representative samples for closer examination and have been placed inside a purpose built calibration chamber that facilitates easy densification and probe testing. A DMT (flat blade dilatometer) was used to hydraulically penetrate the chamber sand sample to varying depths (up to 800 mm). The device can measure (with reduction formula) horizontal stress, angle of friction, bearing capacity and settlement. An accelerometer was attached to the chamber wall and vibration measured with the sand in varying states of moisture. The DMT is an unexplored in-situ soil testing device in South Africa and so far the outcome indicates favourably compared to other devices such as the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP. The DMT has the ability to measure the in-situ stiffness, strength and stress history parameters of soil for better site characterisation. Settlement within the chamber is easily measured. The DMT has, for example, indicated that sand from the Philippi area are a problematic founding soil and should be treated with special care at shallow founding levels. The horizontal stress index is low and according to the available knowledge on soil stress history, these sand, coupled with low densities, can liquefy easily and result in structural damage. The West Coast dune sand, being coarser and easily consolidated, poses less of a problem under liquefiable conditions. A suitable terrain device for easy on-site manoeuvrability is required to assist the DMT in further testing...|$|R
