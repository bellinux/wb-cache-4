She proved to be the U-433, en route to join up with the Italian submarine fleet, the idea being to boost their dwindling morale.

5000|$|The {{destruction}} battalions were restored {{after the}} retreat of German {{forces in the}} newly annexed areas to the Soviet Union. In 1945-46 they were renamed to narodnaya zaschita (people's defence), because of the notoriety their old name had gained in 1941. They were formed from local volunteers, from the most variable layers of the rural communities. They were tasked to guard, secure and support with arms all activities, directives and orders of the Soviet power, which the population could have sabotaged, intentionally avoided or directly resisted. The primary task of the destruction battalions was {{the fight against the}} armed resistance movement. This included terrorising the actual or potential supporters of Forest Brothers among the civilian population, participation in active combat, organisation of ambush and secret guard posts, reconnaissance and search patrols. The passive operations included guard and <b>watch-keeping</b> duties, convoy of detainees and arrested individuals as well as guarding cargo. [...] The destroyers guarded systematically institutions of power and economic objects in the rural areas. In a post-war situation where the factual state power in a rural municipality lay with the Soviet police, the Militsiya, the destroyers constituted a force which guaranteed the implementation of the Soviet policies. A typical task was to force the farmers to fulfil public forestry, peat extraction and road construction obligations. No measures of coercion policy were implemented in the rural communities, which were not carried out or supervised by armed destroyers. They also fought against crime, both independently and as an additional force to the Militsiya. The destruction battalions were great in size, but they never became the efficient and active armed force which they were expected to become in order to rapidly eradicate the Forest Brothers. Despite the primarily passive role of the destroyers in the fight against the resistance movement, they provided invaluable assistance to the active participants in this fight, state security institutions and internal troops. As local people the destroyers spoke the language, knew the people, landscape and circumstances, knowledge which was inadequate among the NKVD and internal troops. The destruction battalions were also very useful as an auxiliary force. The organisation was eventually dismissed in 1954.|$|E

40|$|Numerous factors {{influence}} the increased health risks of seamen. This study investigated sleep (by actigraphy) and {{the adaptation of}} the internal clock in <b>watch-keeping</b> crew compared to day workers, as possible contributory factors. Fourteen watch keepers, 4 h on, 8 h off (0800 - 1200 / 2000 - 2400 h, 1200 - 1600 / 2400 - 0400 h, 1600 - 2000 / 0400 - 0800 h) (fixed schedule, n = 6; rotating by delay weekly, n = 8), and 12 day workers participated during a voyage from the United Kingdom to Antarctica. They kept daily sleep diaries and wore wrist monitors for continuous recording of activity. Sleep parameters were derived from activity using the manufacturer’s software and analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using SAS 8. 2. Sequential urine samples were collected for 48 h weekly for 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin measurement as an index of circadian rhythm timing. Individuals working watches of 1200 - 1600 / 2400 - 0400 h and 1600 - 2000 / 0400 - 0800 h had 2 sleeps daily, analyzed separately as main sleep (longest) and 2 nd sleep. Main sleep duration was shorter in watch keepers than in day workers (p < 0. 0001). Objective sleep quality was significantly compromised in rotaters compared to both day workers and fixed watch keepers, the most striking comparisons being sleep efficiency (percentage desired sleep time spent sleeping) main sleep (p < 0. 0001) and sleep fragmentation (an index of restlessness) main sleep (p < 0. 0001). The 2 nd sleep was substantially less efficient than was the main sleep (p < 0. 0001) for all watch keepers. There were few significant differences in sleep between the different watches in rotating watch keepers. Circadian timing remained constant in day workers. Timing of the 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin rhythm was later for the watch of 1200 - 1600 / 2400 - 0400 h than for all others (1200 - 1600 / 2400 - 0400 h, 5. 90 ± 0. 85 h; 1600 - 2000 / 0400 - 0800 h, 1. 5 ± 0. 64 h; 0800 - 1200 / 2000 - 2400 h, 2. 72 ± 0. 76 h; days, 2. 09 ± 0. 68 h [decimal hours, mean ± SEM]: ANOVA, p < 0. 01).
