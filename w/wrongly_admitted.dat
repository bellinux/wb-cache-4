25|$|After a {{retirement}} of just under an hour, the jury {{returned with a}} verdict of guilty, which implicitly declared Straffen sane. Mr. Justice Cassels sentenced Straffen to death. Straffen appealed, {{on the grounds that}} the evidence about the Bath murders was <b>wrongly</b> <b>admitted,</b> and that his statements on the morning after the murder of Linda Bowyer were <b>wrongly</b> <b>admitted</b> because they had been made before he was cautioned. Both grounds of the appeal were dismissed, and Straffen was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. 4 September was fixed as the date for execution of judgment of death. However, on 29 August, it was announced that Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe had recommended to Queen Elizabeth II that Straffen be reprieved.|$|E
50|$|Because the GRS is {{administered}} by laypeople, critics aver that in a large school system, such as New York City, problems with measurement consistency can be tolerably contained within Regions; {{but it can be}} injurious to students <b>wrongly</b> <b>admitted</b> to more rigorous citywide schools for intellectually gifted.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the twenty-first century, the {{hospital}} began to experience criticism from the public over its aging facilities and patient care. In 2004, the Salem Statesman Journal conducted a two-month investigation into the facility, in which they claimed the hospital's living conditions were overcrowded, also noting outdated facilities. Additionally, the newspaper reported systematic problems resulting in drug addicts and alcoholics being <b>wrongly</b> <b>admitted,</b> as well as severe understaffing and failure of the hospital to properly investigate and prosecute patient assaults against staff members. A 2004 investigation by the Statesman Journal led to further investigation into the hospital, and a 2005 architectural assessment of the facility determined that the site was unsafe. The same year, the hospital's Child and Adolescent Secure Treatment Program was dismantled, and the Oregon Advocacy Center filed a federal suit alleging that overcrowding and understaffing posed a risk to both patients and staff. On August 8, 2006, the hospital was fined USD $10,200 for asbestos violations.|$|E
5000|$|Horowitz wrongly {{attributed}} to Foner {{a statement by}} the late author and journalist, Paul Foot. In the introduction to his book, Horowitz said the profiles were written by 30 researchers he had hired. He wrote: [...] "I have revised and edited all of the profiles contained in this text and rewritten many [...] [...] [...] I am ultimately responsible for their judgements and accuracy." [...] On his blog, Horowitz <b>admitted</b> <b>wrongly</b> attributing material to Eric Foner, blamed the error on the 30 researchers, {{and went on to}} say that the errors in his book are [...] "inconsequential." ...|$|R
5000|$|Williams then petitioned for a writ of {{habeas corpus}} in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Counsel for the State and for Williams stipulated that [...] "the case would be {{submitted}} on the record of facts and proceedings in the trial court, without taking of further testimony." [...] The District Court made findings of fact as summarized above, and concluded {{as a matter of}} law that the evidence in question had been <b>wrongly</b> <b>admitted</b> at Williams' trial. This conclusion was based on three alternative and independent grounds: (1) Williams had been denied his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel; (2) he had been denied the constitutional protections defined by Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, and Miranda v. Arizona; and (3) in any event, his self-incriminatory statements on the automobile trip from Davenport to Des Moines had been involuntarily made. Further, the District Court ruled that there had been no waiver by Williams of the constitutional protections in question.|$|E
