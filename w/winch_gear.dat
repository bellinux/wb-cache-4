50|$|Multi-purpose trainer aircraft. A {{total of}} 350 built powered by Mercury XV engines, {{followed}} by a further 107 powered by the low-octane fuel Mercury XX* engine, giving a total of 457 built, with a further 51 cancelled. Six Mk IVT were converted to dual controls. A further 89 were converted to Mk IVTT Target Tug {{with the addition of}} <b>winching</b> <b>gear</b> in the rear cabin and target drogue storage in the bomb bay.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of making bridges moveable is the lower cost, {{due to the}} absence of high piers and long approaches. The principal disadvantage is that the traffic on the bridge must be halted when it is opened for passages. For seldom-used railroad bridges over busy channels, the bridge may be left open and then closed for train passages. For small bridges, bridge movement may be enabled without the need for an engine. Some bridges are operated by the users, especially those with a boat, others by a bridgeman (or bridge tender); a few remotely using video-cameras and loudspeakers. Generally, the bridges are powered by electric motors, whether operating <b>winches,</b> <b>gearing,</b> or hydraulic pistons. While moveable bridges in their entirety may be quite long, the length of the moveable portion is restricted by engineering and cost considerations to a few hundred feet.|$|R
50|$|The North British Railway {{had long}} been {{operating}} a train ferry for crossing the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay, and in 1881 Samuel L Mason, former General Manager of the NBR, promoted {{the idea of a}} train ferry between the mainland and the Isle of Wight at St Helens. When the Tay crossing ceased operation in 1881, Mason purchased one of the vessels, the paddle steamer Carrier, as well as the approach ramps and <b>winching</b> <b>gear,</b> for £3,400. He made agreements with the LBSCR and the BHIR to construct transfer equipment at St Helens and at Langstone near Havant. On 14 February 1884 the Isle of Wight Marine Transit Company Limited was formed with capital of £30,000. The Transit company took over the agreements and the Carrier and the shore equipment for £28,425. Carrier could carry up to 14 wagons on two tracks, each having a maximum load of four tons.|$|R
25|$|The lift is {{controlled}} by {{a line from the}} surface vessel, and the load is reduced by a lift bag with a volume too small to support the weight of the load when full. This allows a faster lift by the <b>winch.</b> The lifting <b>gear</b> must be capable of supporting the load if the bag fails, or must be arranged to fail safely.|$|R
50|$|Three sets of <b>gears</b> on the <b>winch</b> {{create a}} <b>gear</b> ratio of {{approximately}} 1:113 so that 113 turns of the steam engine {{are required to}} turn the winding drum with its steel cable just one full rotation, however this gives enough force to pull even a ship {{the size of the}} Maid of the Loch slowly out of the water.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of more advanced fittings, equipment and cordage, particularly <b>geared</b> <b>winches,</b> high loads on an individual line (or rope) became less of an issue, and the focus moved to minimising the number of lines and so the size of the crew needed to handle them. This reduced running costs and also enlarged the space available in the ship for profitable cargoes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{unmanned}} Kōtoku Maru remained afloat and adrift and ran aground near Salamaua at [...] The Japanese undertook salvage on her wreck, removing {{some of her}} cargo. After the Allies occupied Salamaua, they salvaged <b>winches</b> {{and other}} <b>gear</b> from her wreck on 15 July 1944. The ship remained upright until sometime after 1945, when she rolled over onto her side.|$|R
50|$|Emerald Lake is a lake {{located in}} the Trinity Alps Wilderness area, in Northern California. The lake sits in a granite bowl, {{approximately}} 5500 ft above sea level. It is dammed with a rock wall constructed many {{years ago when the}} area was used by miners. Visitors can still find old rusty pieces of their equipment around the lake, including giant <b>gears,</b> <b>winches,</b> and cables.|$|R
50|$|Front trailer hitches {{are also}} widely used on pickup trucks and full size SUVs for {{multiple}} purpose. A front-mounted hitch can accommodate additional truck {{equipment such as}} front mount bike carriers, fishing / hunting <b>gear,</b> <b>winches,</b> step plates, snow plows and more. It also allows a driver to temporarily maneuver a trailer with better visibility into any convenient place. Front trailer hitches are mounted directly to the frame of a vehicle to ensure a reliable connection. Front hitches are typically equipped with standard size receiver tubes to accommodate a variety of hitch mount equipment.|$|R
40|$|Over {{a period}} of 26 months, {{emergency}} medical contact was made with 63 sick or injured trawlermen from Hull and Grimsby who had been fishing in the fishing grounds around the Orkney Islands. The majority of accidents were due either to falls in heavy weather, entanglement with <b>winching</b> or fishing <b>gear,</b> or burns and scalds in the galley. Nearly 80 per cent of the episodes of illness which were seen might not have required the emergency service had the trawler crews been properly screened before going to sea, or trained in elementary first aid...|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, the masonry tower mill, on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more {{expensive}} to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by <b>winches</b> or <b>gearing</b> inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, {{at the rear of the}} windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind's direction varied little most of the time.|$|R
2500|$|The Nimbin is {{a vessel}} of [...] with {{a length of}} , a width of , and a depth of [...] She has a total cargo space of 60,900 cubic feet, and is fitted for the {{carrying}} of refrigerated cargo. She ¡s a single-screw vessel, propelled by a Burmeister and Wain 6-cylinder 4-cycle Diesel marine engine, with two auxiliary engines for maintaining the electric light and refrigerating services, and for working the <b>winches</b> and other <b>gear.</b> At her speed trials she developed 12.1 knots. A feature of the vessel is the accommodation for the crew, who have, for Instance, a bathroom fitted with hot and cold showers, in fresh and salt water. The three lifeboats are fitted with patent disengaging gear, which it is claimed, can be set afloat by unskilled hands {{in the space of}} half a minute.|$|R
500|$|On 18 August 1937, the RLM {{decided to}} {{introduce}} the Ju 87 Tr(C). The Ju 87 C {{was intended to be}} a dive and torpedo bomber for the Kriegsmarine. The type was ordered into prototype production and available for testing in January 1938. Testing was given just two months and was to begin in February and end in April 1938. The prototype V10 was to be a fixed wing test aircraft, while the following V11 would be modified with folding wings. The prototypes were Ju 87 B-0 airframes powered by Jumo 211 A engines. Owing to delays, the V10 was not completed until March 1938. It first flew on 17 March and was designated Ju 87 C-1. On 12 May, the V11 also flew for the first time. By 15 December 1939, 915 arrested landings on dry land had been made. It was found that the arresting <b>gear</b> <b>winch</b> was too weak and had to be replaced.

50|$|Over {{the weekend}} teams, {{made up of}} a driver and navigator, must attempt to compete a number of courses marked out though rocks, trees and soil. Teams gain points the further they {{progress}} though the course, but loose points for a variety of errors (such as, using reverse <b>gear,</b> <b>winching,</b> touching the bunting or cones, etc). Each course has a time limit but often vehicles breakdown, rollover or get stuck midway before they are able to complete the course. While there is a set time limit to complete the course, there is no points advantage for finishing the course in a quicker time - it's not a race and making it so would change the categorisation of the event requiring a different safety protections for the competitors, staff and spectators. As the event is about low-speed technical crawling, spectators can get relatively close to the course {{with a high degree of}} safety.|$|R
40|$|Radiologists {{commonly}} use contrast {{agents to}} improve resolution and acuity when employing MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Introducing MRI contrast agents to the {{tissue in the}} innermost part of the femoroacetabular joint is extremely difficult because the anatomy prevents the contrast agents from infiltrating those surfaces. Therefore, getting the ideal image resolution and making diagnosis of the hip is difficult. The objective was to design a product that would successfully distract one hip joint while also stabilizing the patient’s pelvis to improve visualization so that physicians are able to better diagnose the hip. The deliverables included a preliminary model that illustrates how the device will move and apply load, and a minimal viable prototype of the traction device. A platform was designed to contain each component. Traction was applied with a winch that employed a ratchet <b>gear</b> system. The <b>winch</b> could be translated {{to either side of}} the platform via pins holding the <b>winch</b> and <b>gears</b> in place. Stabilizing components included pegs strategically placed under the arms and in the groin area. To alleviate some of the psychological concerns a patient may have, a release mechanism was incorporated into the design. The patient would pull the rope that is attached to the velcro strap on the ankle brace to release their foot from the ankle brace in traction. The spring for the spring scale will be made from beryllium copper because it is non ferromagnetic and is ideal for use as a tension spring. The platform, pegs, winch, and spring box were made from pine plywood. MRI images were taken with and without use of the traction device prototype, and there was a noticeable difference in the space between the femoral head and acetabulum. Our method of providing traction was sufficient and effective in distracting and stabilizing the hip joint. [URL]...|$|R
