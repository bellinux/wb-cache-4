5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, <b>when</b> <b>Iraq</b> under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E

In January 1991, <b>when</b> <b>Iraq</b> failed to comply with United Nations directives to withdraw from Kuwait, the proven skills of the 8th SOS were called on once again as Operation Desert Shield escalated into Operation Desert Storm. The 8th SOS {{played a pivotal role}} in the success of coalition forces as they liberated Kuwait by dropping 11 15,000-pound BLU-82 bombs and 23 million leaflets and conducting numerous aerial refuelings of special operations helicopters.|$|E

25|$|Saddam pushed oil-exporting {{countries}} to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however. In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in OPEC to the cuts that Saddam had requested.

25|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of Iranian civilians and military personnel were killed <b>when</b> <b>Iraq</b> used chemical weapons in its warfare.

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>Iraq</b> invaded Kuwait in 1990, Syria {{joined the}} US-led {{coalition}} against Iraq. This led to improved {{relations with the}} US and other Arab states. Syria participated in the multilateral Southwest Asia Peace Conference in Madrid in October 1991, and during the 1990s engaged in direct negotiations with Israel.

After Desert Fox, Iraq {{stepped up its}} violations of the no-fly zones, thus a number of retaliatory and pre-planned strikes were conducted by F-15Es; in ONW alone, weapons were expended on at least 105 days. Between 24 and 26 January 1999, F-15Es expended several AGM-130s and GBU-12s against SAM sites in northern Iraq near Mosul.

However, she failed to collect enough petition signatures for a non-partisan candidacy. In the same year, she ran in local elections in Monza, Italy, promising to convert a prominent building into a gambling casino, but she attracted few votes.

25|$|Development of Iraq's rivers progressed {{rapidly in}} the mid-20th century as the country sought to control water {{resources}} for agriculture and to prevent flooding in Baghdad. Planning for the Mosul Dam began in the 1950s {{with the help of}} Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, a British firm who identified a location in 1953. In 1956, the Iraq Development Council contracted Koljian American to carry out studies for an irrigation dam at the location. The studies were completed the next year <b>when</b> <b>Iraq</b> asked the Harza Company to carry out a similar investigation who recommended a different location in 1960, based on karst foundations for two other recommended locations. In 1962, Iraq sought a third opinion from the Soviet Technoprom Export company who recommended a separate site. A fourth company, a Finland firm, Imatran Voima carried out a study in 1965 and a fifth company, Geotehnika of Yugoslavia, carried out studies in 1972. Based off the findings of all five companies which cited complex foundations, Iraq had a French firm, Soletanch, to carry out in-depth geological studies which occurred between 1974 and 1978. In 1978 the Swiss Consultants Consortium became the official consultants for the dam.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, Gilmore {{appeared}} on the MSNBC program Tucker, hosted by Tucker Carlson.

He stated that it {{is in the interest of}} Americans to remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war".

On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's This Week and continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee.

40|$|The {{prospect}} of a military offensive against Iraq puts more than {{the price of oil}} into motion.

S. that its real interests lie in seeking to “destroy Iraq in order to control the Middle East oil,” he is making an accusation that resonates in many commentaries from both Western and non-Western sources. Washington, in turn, strictly denies that oil represents a motive for threatening military intervention in Iraq. It does not deny, however, that such an intervention would have repercussions on international oil markets. (author's abstract...|$|R
