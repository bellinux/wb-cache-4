25|$|As {{a result}} of an A$700million {{development}} the Ford EA Falcon introduced in 1988, bore a passing resemblance to the European Ford Scorpio. Under the skin, however, it remained an entirely Australian design, and is credited as the first Falcon model to employ wind tunnel testing. The EA was also only produced in sedan and station <b>wagon</b> <b>body</b> styles, with the previous-model (XF) utility and panel van continuing in production.|$|E

That operation was the foundation of the Kingsford Charcoal company.|$|R
25|$|This {{model was}} also the last to include the Squire range of Ford Falcons which {{featured}} wood panels {{on the side of}} the wagons, similar to the USA-based station wagons. The Fairmont made its debut, midway through the model run, as the flagship of the XP Falcon range. It was offered in both sedan and station <b>wagon</b> <b>body</b> styles, replacing the Futura sedan and Squire wagon. Unlike later examples, the XP Fairmonts carried both Falcon and Fairmont badgework.|$|E

Introduced in 1991 as a 1992 model year, automatic transmission {{became the only}} option on all but the base and sport model Camrys, whereas previously, a manual transmission was available on the majority of trim levels. In addition to the DX and LE trims, 1992 saw the addition of an XLE luxury trim and the SE sport trim. The SE model differs from the LE and XLE in appearance {{with the addition of}} a standard V6 engine, alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, and black side mirrors as well as the sports suspension from the Lexus ES 300.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1920 in Dresden, Germany, as ROTAX-WERK AG. In 1930, it {{was taken over by}} Fichtel & Sachs and {{transferred}} its operations to Schweinfurt, Germany.Operations were moved to Wels, Austria, in 1943 and finally to Gunskirchen, Austria, in 1947.

The wooden <b>wagon</b> <b>bodies</b> carry {{removable seats}} {{at each end}} for workmen. The 1st class, 2nd class, 3rd class, and 'Smoker' legends, {{not to mention that}} on the loco's tank, seem to imply that the whole thing was seen as a bit of a joke. The photo was later used on a Falkland Islands 54p stamp.|$|R
25|$|The LeSabre {{nameplate}} {{made its}} first appearance on the 1951 Le Sabre show car, which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the Buick Special.

In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and <b>wagon</b> <b>body</b> styles.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 Chevelles got new grilles. The lineup {{consisted}} of Malibu and Malibu Classic models in coupe, sedan, and station <b>wagon</b> <b>body</b> styles. Estate Wagons and the Laguna Type S-3 were gone. Malibu Classics, again the top model, {{switched to a}} vertical grille pattern and six-section taillights but kept their twin stacked headlights and stand-up hood ornament. Malibu grilles changed little. Fewer engine selections were available though the engines that remained gained a few horses. In standard form, Chevelles had a 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine or a , 305-cubic-inch V8. The sole option beyond that was a , four-barrel 350-cubic-inch V8 (this engine was standard in the Malibu Classic station wagon) Malibu Classics had a luxurious cloth/vinyl split-bench front seat, color-keyed steering wheel, and woodgrain-accented instrument panel. Malibu options included a $46 Exterior Decor group, $54 tinted glass, and $33 full wheel covers. A total of 37,215 Malibu Classic Landau coupes were produced, as opposed to 73,739 Malibu Classic coupes and 28,793 Malibu coupes. In four-door sedan form, too, the Malibu Classics outsold base models by a substantial margin. The 350 V8 was the top engine.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{also tested}} several {{different}} vehicle modifications which could improve rear impact performance. However, the engineer's occupational caution and aversion to [...] "unproven" [...] solutions {{as well as}} a view that the crash test results were inconclusive resulted in the use of a conventional fuel tank design and placement. [...] The use of an above the axle tank location was considered safer by some (but not all) at Ford. [...] This placement was not a viable option for the hatchback and station <b>wagon</b> <b>body</b> styles.|$|E
50|$|The only {{model that}} was deleted from the 1962 lineup was the Deluxe series two-door wagon, which had slipped in {{popularity}} since the four-door wagon's debut in 1960. However, some leftover 1961-model two-door <b>wagon</b> <b>bodies</b> were fitted {{with the new}} 1962 front clips. This was done to fill a U.S. government fleet order. No one is certain how many were built, although the number was certainly minuscule, and none are known to exist today.|$|R
5000|$|From about 1921, {{by order}} of the Reich Transport Ministry (RVM), almost all goods wagons were marked {{with the name of}} their owner, [...] "Deutsche Reichsbahn", the name of a {{so-called}} [...] "class district" [...] (Gattungsbezirk), a wagon number ( [...] Wagennummer) and category letters (Gattungszeichen). The <b>wagon</b> <b>bodies</b> were painted in red-brown livery (paint number 11a), the wagon roofs in light grey (paint number 47) and the chassis, railings, etc., in a black colour (paint numbers 14,24,33).|$|R

500|$|Holden's next model, the FE, {{launched}} in 1956; offered {{in a new}} station <b>wagon</b> <b>body</b> style dubbed [...] "Station Sedan" [...] in the company's sales literature. In the same year Holden commenced exports to Malaya, Thailand and North Borneo. Strong sales continued in Australia, and Holden achieved a market share of more than 50percent in 1958 with the revised FC model. This was the first Holden to be tested on the new Holden Proving Ground based in Lang Lang, Victoria. 1957 saw Holden's export markets grow to 17 countries, with new additions including Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Fiji, Sudan, the East Africa region and South Africa. Indonesian market cars were assembled locally by P.T. Udatin. The opening of the Dandenong, Victoria, production facility in 1956 brought further jobs; by 1959 Holden employed 19,000 workers country-wide. In 1959 complete knock down assembly began in South Africa and Indonesia.|$|E

2500|$|Popular Mechanics {{described}} the newly added 1977 Station <b>Wagon</b> <b>body</b> style as a [...] "Styling Coup", and said: [...] "who needs the coupe!" ...|$|E
50|$|Three {{variations}} — Speedway, DeLuxe and Plainsman — were offered, {{each with}} a coupe and sedan, plus a DeLuxe three-door woody wagon. USHCO/USB&F built a small run of station <b>wagon</b> <b>bodies</b> for Willys. Five examples were built on model 440 coup chassis in 1940, and a second group of five in 1941 on model 441 coupe chassis. All wagons featured a single door on the driver's side and the belt line on the 1941 models differed from those built in 1940.|$|R
5000|$|Constructed by {{the railway}} company in 1900, and later rebuilt with <b>wagon</b> <b>bodies</b> on either side, the {{locomotive}} is now privately owned. It was restored in 1983 and operated {{as part of}} the centenary and subsequent celebrations, painted in the [...] "Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Co. Ltd." [...] livery. In 1993 the vehicle was named “Dr R. Preston Hendry” in recognition of the man who did so much to save the railways of the island at a difficult time.|$|R
50|$|Hatchback and estate or station <b>wagon</b> <b>bodies</b> {{are sold}} as 'three-door' or 'five-door' models. In these cases, the rear hatch is {{classified}} as a door; this is because it enters the passenger compartment. With other vehicles such as saloons or sedans and coupés, the boot/trunk lid is not counted as a door by definition because {{it is for a}} separate storage compartment - these cars are sold as 'two-door' or 'four-door'. This system is mainly used in Europe, and is less common in North America. In Europe, the American-style labelling is occasionally used.|$|R
