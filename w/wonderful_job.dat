I do, in fact, enjoy most {{aspects of the}} job {{including}} the many challenges, {{the fact that there}} is nothing routine about the work, and the many public aspects of the position such as receptions, bar meetings, tailgate parties, law review banquets, and bar luncheons. I enjoy students. We would not have these <b>wonderful</b> <b>jobs</b> in law teaching without them. I like faculty and still think of myself as a law professor first. It is fun to do alumni relations and developmental work, and I would love to have more time on the road for friend raising and fund raising. Many of us who go into deaning are gregarious and outgoing people. As an extrovert, I have had the pleasure during my three deanships of getting to know and working with many interesting people. It is quite entertaining to sit at an alumni luncheon with a couple of recent graduates, some from the early 2 ̆ 770 s, and senior attorney who finished law school in the late 1940 s, and listen to them talk about the law school, the practice of law, and their many experiences...|$|R

60|$|We may believe, then, {{from the}} plain words of Scriptures, {{that there are}} vast numbers of evil spirits {{continually}} tempting men, each of them to some particular sin; to worldliness, for instance, for we read {{of the spirit of}} the evil world; to filthiness, for we read of unclean spirits; to falsehood, for we read of lying spirits and a spirit of lies; to pride, for we read of a spirit of pride;--in short, to all sins which a man CAN commit, to all evil passions to which a man can give way. We have a right to believe, from the plain words of Scripture, that these spirits are continually wandering up and down tempting men to sin.

500|$|Due to its Japanese exclusivity, {{most of the}} English-language {{reviews for}} Seiken Densetsu 3 were {{published}} years after the initial release. One contemporary English-language review was in 1995 in GameFan, which covered import games, and rated the game highly. The Japanese Famitsu review also rated the game highly, though slightly lower than Secret of Mana. The Portuguese SuperGamePower magazine also gave it a positive contemporary review, noting it as having {{some of the best}} graphics of any game on the SNES. Critics have also rated the game highly in retrospective reviews, published mostly after the release of the fan translation patch in 2000. The graphics were praised; a review from 1UP.com called the game [...] "absolutely gorgeous", which they attributed to its position {{towards the end of the}} era of 2D SNES games, but before developers tried to start working with prerendered 3D graphics. A review by Chris Parsons of RPGamer agreed, terming the graphics [...] "awesome" [...] and positively comparing some of the effects to PlayStation RPGs, which the Cubed3 review by Adam Riley did as well. A preview by Next Generation written after the release of the game in Japan stated that the detailed graphics [...] "puts just about every other recent 32-bit RPG to shame", while the review by Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life also noted the game as one of the best graphically on the SNES and called out the unique visual styles of each area in the game as of particular note. The game's music was also generally praised; Nintendo Lifes Dillard called it [...] "spectacular from start to finish", while Cubed3s Riley said it was [...] "one of the most sonically pleasing out of the whole SNES lifetime" [...] and RPGamers Parsons said that [...] "a <b>wonderful</b> <b>job</b> was done in the composition of the music".

Here was a guy who would never say, 'What am I doing here?' He could look at a forest and know it was there because of his efforts. This is what we should have been doing - have them plant a tree, clean up a stream," [...] Vaughn said. [...] "That was the explosion of awareness that changed the Peace Corps, because I wised up and still had time to do something about it. Those generalists, with no prior technical training, could be trained to do a beautiful job in just 10 weeks to turn wasteland into forest, to run nurseries, to do earth dam construction and supervision.

At the official Doctor Who Convention 'Panopticon' organized by the Doctor Who Appreciation Society to celebrate the show's 30th anniversary in 1993, Manning was interviewed on stage with Jon Pertwee and insisted that Jo would have divorced Dr Jones, stating [...] "I tell you what, she's left him! The one she went.. no way! She definitely left him. She got half way up the Amazon and said 'this is not going to work'. So I would only come back if she wasn't still married".
