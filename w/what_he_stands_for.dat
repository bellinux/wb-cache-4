500|$|Liam Neeson reprises {{his role}} as the voice of the lion Aslan. Aslan is [...] "more parental here, [...] lets the kids, well, make their own mistakes". Aslan's {{entrance}} was filmed as a dream sequence to emphasize his messianic nature, and not make it reflect badly on his absence when Narnia is in turmoil. Although the character is considered C.S. Lewis' version of Jesus, Neeson [...] "see him more as the spirit of the planet – this living, breathing planet. That's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for,</b> for me; more what the native Americans would believe." [...] As Aslan has fewer action scenes than in the first film, the animators found it difficult to make him move interestingly. His pose had to be regal, but if he moved his head too much, he would remind viewers of a dog. As well as having his size increased by fifteen percent, Aslan's eyes were also changed to look less [...] "Egyptian". Many of his shots were finished at the last minute.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{revealed}} to Billboard in September 2012 on {{a preview of}} his cover story that he recorded an album that represented his freedom. On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for,</b> mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E

5000|$|... "Some {{argue that}} history has {{transformed}} Che's revolutionary image into just another fashion accessory. It is tempting {{for those of}} us on the leftto feel uncomfortable with his popular appeal; rather like music fans who, when their favorite underground band hits the big time, moan that they've 'gone commercial' ... I don't see it that way. If only 10 {{percent of the people who}} wear the image know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>for,</b> that is still many millions. Overwhelmingly, they are also young people, with their hearts set on making the world a better place. Indeed, in my experience, many more than 10 percent have a very good idea of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> ...

[...] A Sun article published the previous month had reported that Blobby reduced a young girl to tears after throwing her birthday cake onto the floor during a show, causing the girl's father to mount the stage and assault Blobby.

It will dig deeper emotionally than his debut album and represent almost a [...] "song diary" [...] that comes from a mixture of his life experiences since [...] "Give It All Away" [...] and from other parts of his life before his Idol experience. One of his new songs focuses on his experience in Afghanistan. Theo has already begun the intense writing process with one of his heroes, who will also be producing the record.

Crooke did not seek self-advancement. He gave freely of his energies and abilities and of his means to {{the best interests of}} India. He made culpable ignorance of the Indian peoples no longer pardonable. Singularly staunch and loyal as a friend, he never wavered in his allegiance to the people under his charge, and the good he wrought will some day and in some manner bear fruit.|$|R

The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>for,</b> and who <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> up <b>for.</b> And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|R

He blamed apathy and carelessness in Unionist ranks for his defeat, and said that so-called loyalists who stayed at home playing a neutral part had indirectly supported Sinn Féin. Beattie then insisted that he asked for support not for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was, but <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>for,</b> which <b>he</b> defined as civil and religious liberty for Roman Catholics and Protestants alike. There was said to be an inquest in the Unionist Party into disagreements and apathy and the lack of support given to Beattie.|$|R
50|$|It's {{not long}} before Jux and his pals start to {{discover}} something is very weird in this place. No communication {{to the outside world}} seems to exist, until local rancher Matthew (Chuck Norris) offers them the use of his two-way radio. The town at large despises Matthew, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for.</b> It's soon revealed that the town elder, Joshua (Marshall R. Teague) is in fact an agent of Satan who has controlled the children of Ceres for centuries, to bring about an unholy war. Matthew has been sent by God to observe, protect, and lead broken believers (like Jux) back to their faith in Jesus Christ. As the forces of evil prepare for a spiritual Armageddon, using the town's children as terrifying hosts, even Matthew can not interfere alone, and Jux, Conrad and Oren must choose which side they will stand with...for all eternity.|$|E

In return, Teddy offers Damien full amnesty, a life with Sinéad, and the vision of an Ireland where Pro- and Anti-Treaty Irishmen can raise families side by side. Insulted, Damien responds by saying that he will never [...] "sell out" [...] the Republic the way Chris Reilly did and Teddy leaves the cell in tears.

Feldman wrote, “If we read about ‘cannabalistic and primitive Africa,’…It is a deliberate effort to put down a whole people and Dr. Du Bois fought this… Dr. Burroughs saw Dr. Du Bois and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> and how <b>he</b> suffered himself to attain exposure of his views.
