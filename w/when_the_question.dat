5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1920s {{the tension between}} the air and naval {{services}} had declined. It arose briefly again in 1937 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the FAA operational control arose. On this occasion the British Government sided with the Admiralty. Despite a spirited defence of its asset, once the Minister for Coordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip had decided to transfer the arm, the Air Ministry was content to let the matter rest. Any threat to the Air Ministry's existence had long since passed; budgetary constraint, and the reluctance to engage in another battle which would waste resources were also factors in the Air Ministry's decision not to contest the issue further. However, inter-service squabbling assured maritime aviation's stagnation, especially in shore-based elements. Virtually no co-operation existed in the area of research and development. In the case of Coastal Command, it continued to come third in the Air Ministry's list of priorities, after Fighter and Bomber Commands, well into the late 1930s.|$|E

25|$|By the 1970s, the zoo {{with its}} new polar bear exhibit, built in 1962, had become the park's main attraction. Today the only remnant of the old zoo is a large {{concrete}} grotto where the polar bears had entertained crowds for many years until the 1990s.

25|$|When {{a feature}} has both artistic (copyrightable) and {{functional}} (patentable) merits, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{has appeared in}} US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can {{be separated from the}} functional aspects of the item. In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.|$|E

25|$|Anna Christensen {{was born}} in 1936 in Tumba, Sweden. She studied law at Stockholm University and carried out her studies in Uppsala where she, in 1970, {{successfully}} defended her dissertation in Commercial Law; Studies in the Law of Sale of Goods (Studier i Köprätt). Her doctoral thesis dealt {{with some of the}} problems concerning the right to treat a contract as of sale of goods as discharged – the right of rescission – in various situations that may rise in the course of performance. Focus was put on those special considerations relevant to the right of rescission which depended on how far performance had proceeded <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of rescission came up. Five years later, in 1975, Anna Christensen was appointed Professor in Private Law at the Faculty of Law at Lund University.|$|E
25|$|During the Riksdag of 1765, {{the queen}} {{attempted}} {{to balance the}} Caps and the Hats by creating a third party of her followers from both parties under her follower Malmstein, which she managed to have elected vice speaker. The election to the Riksdag of 1765 was won by the Caps party. By demonstrating how she could affect the votes in the parliament through her third party, {{she was able to}} secure her alliance with the Caps. She also summoned the Ambassador of Russia to Kina slott to secure support from Russia and its ally Denmark. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the constitution was finally raised in the Riksdag in August, however, the Caps refused to accept an increased royal power and instead limited to power of the crown even more.

25|$|Some comic books, {{especially}} superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the {{exclamation point}} {{instead of the}} period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or {{they do not know}} what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Ribbentrop {{was found}} to have had culpability in the Holocaust based on his efforts to persuade the leaders of {{satellite}} countries of the Third Reich to deport Jews to the Nazi extermination camps. In August 1941, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether to deport foreign Jews living in Germany arose, Ribbentrop argued against deportation as a way of maximizing the Foreign Office's influence. To deport foreign Jews living in the Reich, Ribbentrop had Luther negotiate agreements with the governments of Romania, Slovakia, and Croatia to allow Jews holding citizenship of those states to be deported. In September 1941, the Reich Plenipotentiary for Serbia, Felix Benzler, reported to Ribbentrop that the SS had arrested 8,000 Serbian Jews, whom they were planning to execute en masse. He asked for permission to try to stop the massacre. Ribbentrop assigned the question to Luther, who ordered Benzler to co-operate fully in the massacre.|$|E

He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences, and at least once he flew into a violent rage <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of Ted's paternity was raised.
