The boys and girls lived separately, things made available for example dining hall, laundry, bakery and classrooms. There was emphasis on Catholic Catechism and academics and then a shift to agriculture and industrial vocations including woodworking, attending mass, ironing and sewing. Parents that were able to visit were allowed to visit and some camped around school area. Up until 1948 students were given permission to visit the city of Mission.
