5000|$|Diplodus sargus, called <b>white</b> <b>{{seabream}}</b> and sargo, is {{a species}} of seabream native to the eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans. It is found from the Bay of Biscay southwards to South Africa, including Madeira and the Canary Islands, the Mediterranean and (rarely) the Black Sea. Occasionally individuals are found off the Indian Ocean coasts of South Africa, Mozambique and Madagascar, {{and they are very}} rarely found elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, such as off Oman. An active fish, they inhabit the surf zone, but they may be found down to 50 m. They consume small crustaceans, mollusks and some seaweed and coral, using their strong jaws to crush shells. Individuals can reach 45 cm, but average 22 cm.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{concentration}} of mercury (Hg) in the muscle of a common littoral, omnivorous fish such as the <b>white</b> <b>seabream,</b> Diplodus sargus, and to evaluate its relationship with the age and size of the specimens. Large, older predatory fishes have typically been the main target species for risk assessment of Hg intake in humans. The <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> is neither a big fish nor a predator, but all sizes of NW Mediterranean specimens of this species showed high levels of Hg, with clear increases in older specimens. In addition, although the Se:Hg molar ratio was high and could reduce the impact of high concentrations of Hg in smaller fishes, it could not in the older specimens of D. sargus analysed because it decreased with age. This is not a major concern for human health because the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> is not a widely consumed species. However, in special situations involving toddlers, children and women of childbearing age, problems might arise if the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> or similar species are consumed in place of those that current recommendations advise against eating. In these cases it is very important to consider the species of fish consumed in each country and carefully assess the risk of Hg intak...|$|E

All rights reservedTo make a first {{approach}} {{in the assessment of}} the sea urchin predators in the Azores, the diet of <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus sargus) and ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta), were studied by the analyses of their stomach contents. The <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> is a diurnal omnivore, feeding on algae, sea-urchins, worms, gastropods and amphipods, while ballan wrasse fed mainly on echinoderms (sea-urchins), gastropods and decapods. Both species tended to feed on harder prey, such as echinoderms and gastropods, as they grew. Although both species feed upon similar resources, the diet overlap was low. This study shows that the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> and the ballan wrasse are important predators of sea-urchins in Azorean coastal habitats. Furthermore, larger fish account for most of the predation on sea-urchins. Thus, a reduction in the abundance and mean size of fishes, which is a typical consequence of fishing, may significantly decrease predation on sea-urchins and could thus facilitate their proliferation...|$|E

We have analysed population dynamic of two diplectanid species, Lamellodiscus echeneis and Lamellodiscus ignoratus (Monogenea: Diplectanidae) collected from two bream {{species in the}} Beymelek Lagoon (southwest coast of Turkey), comparing it between different host variables (fish size, age and sex) {{in order to have}} insight in parasites’ ecology, important for managing parasitosis in the intensive aquaculture system. In seabream (N[*]=[*] 127), L. echeneis prevalence was 46. 5 % (exact 95 % confidence limits 38. 90 - 54. 14), mean abundance 5. 64 (bootstrap 95 % confidence limits 4. 20 – 7. 65) and mean intensity 12. 14 (bootstrap 95 % confidence limits 9. 49 – 15. 59).

40|$|It {{has been}} hypothesized, based on anecdotal {{information}} and reports, that adult <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> migrate and aggregate during spawning. Because {{most of the}} past telemetric studies on this ecologically and commercially important species were short in duration and did not cover the reproductive season, we set out to use longer-term passive acoustic telemetry to test this hypothesis. We found that <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> expands its home range and increases the frequency of forays during the reproductive season, but found no obvious signs of spawning aggregations. Our results thus provide evidence for short-range behavioral shifts in fish space use related to reproductive activity, and support the notion that small MPAs may be effective in managing reef fish populations by effectively protecting their spawning biomass.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible {{influence of the}} Siculo-Tunisian Strait on the genetic structure of <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus sargus, 13 polymorphic allozyme loci and a fragment of the cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were analysed.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{deficit of}} hatchery reared (HR) fish used for stock enhancement {{is the main}} cause of their low survival in the wild. In this study the effects of predator and shelter conditioning on survival and dispersal of HR <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus sargus) released at sea were investigated. The hypotheses were that conditioned <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> would avoid predators more efficiently and would be more capable to shelter, showing higher survival and smaller dispersal than naïve fish. Six thousand HR <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> (6. 32 ± 0. 93 cm total length) were allocated in twelve plastic tanks and divided in four experimental groups: three groups were conditioned with a predator, a refuge or both, while one group was left unconditioned and used as a control. The conditioning phase lasted 30 days and was conducted using live conger eels as predators and pyramids of perforated bricks as refuges. Flight initiation distance (FID) and time to shelter (TS) were used as response variables to test the effects of conditioning in the arena, using a dummy conger eel. The effect of conditioning on post-release survival and dispersal was assessed through the monitoring of 1465 tagged seabream belonging to the four experimental groups, released at sea. Underwater visual census was used as monitoring technique. The sighting rate (SR) (sighted fish/ released fish× 100) and the distance (D) of each sighted fish from the release site were used as proxies for post-release survival and dispersion, respectively.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{constrains}} for commercial aquaculture production of <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus sargus) is {{the high incidence of}} skeletal malformations in reared fish. The {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of these types of skeletal malformations by comparative proteomic analysis of the vertebral column of normal and deformed fish using 2 DE for protein separation and MS for protein identification. We observed a 3. 2 and 3. 4 -fold increase in the expression of two tropomyosin isoforms, one of which (tropomyosin- 4) is essential for the motility and polarization cycles of osteoclasts. Furthermore, a 1. 6, 1. 7 and 1. 8 -fold increase in three parvalbumin spots was detected, suggesting a cellular response to increased intracellular Ca 2 + levels. These results can be interpreted as signs of increased cellular activity in the bone of <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> with skeletal deformities coupled to a higher degree of calcium mobilization, which elicits further studies into the use of these proteins as indicators of skeletal metabolic state...|$|E
40|$|Morphometric {{characters}} of the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus sargus (Linnaeus 1758) were compared among samples collected from six marine and lagoon sites along the Tunisian coast to elucidate {{the impact of the}} geographical barrier of the Siculo-Tunisian Strait and/or the lagoon environment in the morphological variation among the Tunisian <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> population. Two morphometric descriptors (twenty-five Truss elements and six traditional measurements) were used to study the pattern of this morphological variation. Univariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences (P <  0. 001) for both traditional and Truss variables. Multivariate analysis using the two morphometric descriptors detected a clear variation in the body shape between D. sargus populations along the Tunisian coast. All these analyses showed the distinctness of the sample from El Biban lagoon compared to the remaining ones. This discrimination was due to the head and the peduncle of the studied fish. Varying degrees of differences were also observed between northern and southern samples, and between the lagoon and the marine samples. The morphological variations of the head explain also the discrimination between the different lagoons samples.

40|$|Human {{exploitation}} has {{drastically reduced}} the abundance {{and distribution of}} several marine fish and invertebrate populations through overfishing and habitat destruction. Restocking can potentially mitigate these impacts and help to reconstitute depleted stocks but genetic repercussions must be considered. In the present study, the degree of genetic similarity between <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus sargus Linnaeus 1758) individuals reared for restocking purposes and the receiving population in the Gulf of Castellammare fishery reserve (Sicily, Italy) was assessed using microsatellites. We also inferred the spatial pattern of the genetic structure of D. sargus and connectivity along Sicilian coasts. The farmed population showed significant heterozygosity deficiency in 6 loci and an important {{reduction in the number}} of alleles, which could indicate an incipient inbreeding. Both the farmed population and the target one for restocking (Castellammare fishery reserve), showed high and significant values of genetic differentiation due to different allele frequencies, number of privative alleles and total number of alleles. These findings indicate a low degree of genetic similarity between both populations, therefore this restocking initiative is not advisable. The genetic connectivity pattern, highly consistent with oceanographic currents, identified two distinct metapopulations of <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> around Sicily. Thus it is recommended to utilize broods from the same metapopulation for restocking purposes to provide a better genetic match to the wild populations...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} the first about the dietary mannan {{oligosaccharide}} {{and its effect on}} the development on the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus sargus. Larvae of the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> were fed Artemia, which was enriched by two different enrichment products (A 1 DHA Selco, INVE® and Advantage Aquagrow, ABN®) each with and without the oligosaccharide supplementation (BioMos) on separate occasions. The results show that both of the enrichment products can produce good quality fish larvae, but by adding the mannan oligosaccharide (BioMos) the quality offish larvae can be increased. Additionally, there is evidence that mannan oligosaccharide may effect the larval development positively. A histological examination at the level of light microscopy (mm) and at the level of electron microscopy (pm) was conducted. The results from Light microscopy suggest {{that there may be a}} positive effect on the gut morphology and function. The results from Transmission Electron Microscopy present a clear positive influence of the mannan oligosaccharide on the structure of microvilli. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect any difference in the hygiene of the gut ("clean" gut) because larvae were reared in the best of conditions with a high quality of water. Finally, it is believed that mannan oligosaccharide has a great potential in aquaculture. there are many things that have to be investigated in order to fully understand the role of mannan oligosaccharide in fish and in aquaculture in general.

In the past 10 years, there have been {{reported}} an increase of strange specimens: they became hard after cooking, and make them non eatable. That has never been seen on any other species of Diplodus. Despite the caulerpin has been described as the cause (which is a toxic invasive algae Caulerpa cylindracea (before called Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea)), this hypothesis may not be applied to the catalan coast, because there are no important reports of the algae’s emergence. In the current study, we have examined the stomach and intestinal content of 26 white seabreams of different sizes in order to disprove this hypothesis and so we can consider new hypothesis to describe what causes that anomaly. The results of the feeding study match the current literature: <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> is a not specialist fish, and has an omnivorous and strongly varied diet which depends on different factors like the seasonality or the geographical area. It has been determined what animal preys and what ingested plants show more frequency and abundance in the diet. The most habitual species can’t be the observed anomaly’s cause, because nor animal preys or none of the habitual ingested plants have toxicity.

40|$|Two {{different}} modes for regulation of stomach acid secretion {{have been described}} in vertebrates. Some species exhibit a continuous acid secretion maintaining a low gastric pH during fasting. Others, as some teleosts, maintain a neutral gastric pH during fasting while the hydrochloric acid is released only after the ingestion of a meal. Those different patterns seem to be closely related to specific feeding habits. However, our recent observations suggest that this acidification pattern could be modified by changes in daily feeding frequency and time schedule. The {{aim of this study}} was to advance in understanding the regulation mechanisms of stomach digestion and pattern of acid secretion in teleost fish. We have examined the postprandial pattern of gastric pH, pepsin activity, and mRNA expression for pepsinogen and proton pump in <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> juveniles maintained under a light/dark 12 / 12 hours cycle and receiving only one morning meal. The pepsin activity was analyzed according to the standard protocol buffering at pH 2 and using the actual pH measured in the stomach. The results show how the enzyme precursor is permanently available while the hydrochloric acid, which activates the zymogen fraction, is secreted just after the ingestion of food. Results also reveal that analytical protocol at pH 2 notably overestimates true pepsin activity in fish stomach. The expression of the mRNA encoding pepsinogen and proton pump exhibited almost parallel patterns, with notable increases during the darkness period and sharp decreases just before the morning meal.

40|$|Artificial reefs {{are used}} by many {{fisheries}} managers {{as a tool to}} mitigate the impact of fisheries on coastal fish communities by providing new habitat for many exploited fish species. However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i. e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white seabreams were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white seabreams differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes. Future management plans of coastal areas and fisheries resources, including artificial reef implementation, should therefore consider the potential effect of habitat modification on fish behavior, which could have key implications on fish dynamics. © 2013 Koeck et al.

At 15 days after hatching (DAH), proteome expression changes were assessed in entire larvae by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis {{and the quality of}} larval skeleton was analysed at 28 DAH through double staining of cartilage and bone. Dietary PH fractions tested affected growth, the larvae fed diet L being significantly larger than those fed diet H, but it did not affect the incidence of deformed larvae, nor the number of deformities per fish. Two-dimensional analysis of larvae proteome allowed the detection and the comparative quantification of a total of 709 protein spots having a pI between 4 and 7, around half of which had an expression significantly affected by dietary treatment, the main difference being between proteome of Control larvae with those of both groups L and H. From these spots, 52 proteins involved in diverse processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, energetic, lipoprotein, amino acid (AA), and nucleotide metabolisms, protein chaperoning and degradation, and signal transduction, were identified. This study revealed that the molecular weight of the dietary protein hydrolysate fraction had a minor impact on skeletal deformities in <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> larvae, but affected growth performance and had a strong impact on larvae whole body proteome.

To achieve this, a total of 188 individuals from four island localities (Castellamare and Mallorca, Mediterranean Sea; Azores and Canary Islands, Atlantic Ocean) and five coastal localities (Banyuls, Murcia and Tunisia, Mediterranean Sea; Galicia and Faro, Atlantic Ocean) were analysed. Results showed high haplotype diversity and low to moderate nucleotide diversity in all populations (except for the Canary Islands). This pattern of genetic diversity is attributed to a recent population expansion which is corroborated by other results such as cyt-b network and demographic analyses. Low differentiation among Mediterranean/Atlantic and coastal/island groups was shown by the AMOVA and FST values, although a weak phylogeographic break was detected using cyt-b data. However, we found a clear and significant island/ distance effect {{with regard to the}} Azores islands.

40|$|Observational {{data suggest}} that the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus sargus, a sparid fish of {{economic}} and ecological relevance in the Mediterranean Sea, has included the invasive green alga Caulerpa racemosa in its diet. Here we adopted a chemoecological approach to study the trophic relationship between the fish and the exotic pest. We demonstrated that the red pigment caulerpin, the most abundant secondary metabolite of C. racemosa, enters food chains and accumulates in the fish tissues. General biological condition markers associated with fish health and reproductive development were measured and correlated with the caulerpin levels in the fish tissues. Significant correlations among caulerpin tissue load (determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis) and fish condition factor and hepatosomatic index were obtained, suggesting a possible detrimental effect of the dietary exposure to C. racemosa on D. sargus. Glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity were also significantly correlated with caulerpin concentrations in the liver, suggesting a possible interaction between algal metabolites and liver antioxidant mechanisms. Studies on the impact of invasive macroalgae on marine assemblages have been almost exclusively focused on the structural modification of benthic assemblages, through the alteration of the relative importance of some endemic species and the modification of habitat complexity. Here we propose a new mechanism by which invasive algae can impact marine systems, namely the entry of pest metabolites in food webs, with potential detrimental effects on the population dynamics of a single species, alteration of trophic webs and changes in the functioning of coastal ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{ontogeny}} of {{the digestive}} tract of the <b>white</b> <b>seabream,</b> Diplodus sargus during the larval development up to day 45 post-hatching (dph) has been studied using histological and histochemical techniques. The oesophageal goblet cells appeared around 6 dph and contained neutral and acid mucosubstances (PAS/diastase-PAS and Alcian Blue pH 2. 5 positive reactions). An incipient stomach can be distinguished from 2 dph but {{the first sign of}} gastric gland development was detected around 13 - 15 dph, increasing in number and size by 22 - 23 dph. Gastric glands were concentrated in the cardiac stomach region and they had a high content of protein rich in tyrosine, arginine and tryptophan. Acidophilic supranuclear inclusions related to pynocitosis of proteins, were already observed in the intestinal cells of the posterior intestine around 4 - 6 dph (exogenous feeding) and they were present until 25 dph. The intestinal mucous cells appeared between 15 - 18 dph and contained a mixture of neutral and acid mucosubstances/glycoconjugates, carboxylated ones being more abundant than the sulphated ones. The stomach and gastric glands were fully developed by the first month of life marking the beginning of digestive features characteristic of the juvenile stage. Around 4 - 6 dph, glycogen, proteins and neutral lipids were observed in the granular cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Strongly acidophilic zymogen granules were also present, at this time, in the basophilic cytoplasm of the exocrine pancreatic acinar cells and contained abundant proteins, especially rich in arginine, tyrosine and tryptophan...|$|E
40|$|The green alga Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea has invaded Mediterranean seabed {{including}} marine reserves, {{modifying the}} structure of habitats and altering the distributional patterns of associated organisms. However, the understanding of how such invasion can potentially affect functional properties of Mediterranean subtidal systems {{is yet to be}} determined. In this study, we show that C. racemosa changes foraging habit of the native <b>white</b> <b>seabream,</b> Diplodus sargus. In invaded areas, we found a high frequency of occurrence of C. racemosa in the stomach contents of this omnivorous fish (72. 7 and 85. 7 %), while the alga was not detected in fish from a control area. We also found a significant accumulation of caulerpin, one of the main secondary metabolites of C. racemosa, in fish tissues. The level of caulerpin in fish tissues was used here as an indicator of the trophic exposure to the invasive pest and related with observed cellular and physiological alterations. Such effects included activation of some enzymatic pathways (catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, total glutathione and the total oxyradical scavenging capacity, 7 -ethoxy resorufin O-deethylase), the inhibition of others (acetylcholinesterase and acylCoA oxidase), an increase of hepatosomatic index and decrease of gonadosomatic index. The observed alterations might lead to a detrimental health status and altered behaviours, potentially preventing the reproductive success of fish populations. Results of this study revealed that the entering of alien species in subtidal systems can alter trophic webs and can represent an important, indirect mechanism which might contribute to influenc...|$|E
40|$|Brackish water {{ecosystems}} are often exposed to wide variations in environmental variables, including temperature and salinity, which may cause strong selective pressures on organisms modifying the genetic patterns of species. The {{aim of this}} work was to test {{whether there is a}} ‘divergence-with-gene flow’ in coastal lagoon populations of <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus sargus) (Ria Formosa, S Portugal and Mar Menor, SE Spain) respect to four marine populations, by using partial sequences of cyt b mitochondrial gene and information from nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was highest in both coastal lagoons (Mar Menor and Ria Formosa) considering mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Although some of FST population pairwise comparisons were not significant, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs) detected differences between groups (coastal lagoon and marine) close to significance. Also, only two haplotypes (Cytb- 17 and Cytb- 18) were detected in both coastal lagoon sampling sites and these localities (Mar Menor and Ria Formosa) showed the highest number of singletons, some of them with a high number of mutations, as has been already described for other Mar Menor populations (Pomatochistus marmoratus and Holothuria polii). Also, several tests detected significant positive and balancing selection considering mtDNA and microsatellite data. These data support the hypothesis of selection as one of the drivers of the genetic differences found between coastal lagoon and marine populations. The life strategy adopted by Diplodus sargus in coastal lagoons allows it to decrease its mortality rate and improve the heritability of its genes. Also, the increase time spent in coastal lagoons with different temperatures and salinities favours the fitness selection and the maintenance of exclusive haplotypes and genotypes in coastal lagoon inhabitants favouring the ‘divergence-with-gene-flow’...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} done in a natural park (Southwest Alentejo and Vicentina Coast Natural Park - PNSACV) a marine area with an {{extension}} of two km offshore all along its coastline (Marine Protected Area - MPA). The “recreational fishing” {{it is part of}} the tradition of the people living in these near municipalities, having inherited a taste for rock fishing and shell fishing of their ancestors. They are deprived of a moment's notice based on a law without being heard, without anyone to defend the tradition inculcated in each. In this park, since 2006, with the first law (868 / 2006) several fishing management measures have been implemented like, limitations and prohibitions without studies and licenses based on dissuasive law. In practice, the process was reversed. What should be awareness and public participation became a force against the will of the people. The another law (Portaria 143 / 2009) for de PNSACV area it`s even more restrictive, separating the principle of equality between nationals and resident people in PNSACV, compared to the law (Portaria 144 / 2009) for the entire national territory. These restrictions were not accepted by the population who express their discontent in Sagres, Odemira, Vila Nova de Milfontes and the Assembly of the Republic in Lisbon. A working group was created and a law was changed revoked. Currently, the most relevant restrictive measures are the “false” temporal limitation to catch <b>white</b> <b>seabream,</b> because it`s only effective for rock angler; established minimum sizes and weight maximums for marine organisms like, crustaceans, bivalves, gastropods, mollusks and fish; angler fishing licenses are required. Populations and commissions where heard and the scientific community begin working with the anglers in some studies. All should have been started here...|$|E
40|$|Themarine {{environment}} seems, {{at first}} sight, to be a homogeneousmediumlacking barriers to species dispersal. Nevertheless, populations of marine species show {{varying levels of}} gene flow and population differentiation, so barriers to gene flow can often be detected. Weaimto elucidate the role of oceanographical factors ingenerating connectivity among populations shaping the phylogeographical patterns in the marine realm, which {{is not only a}} topic of considerable interest for understanding the evolution ofmarine biodiversity but also formanagement and conservation of marine life. For this proposal,we investigate the genetic structure and connectivity between continental and insular populations ofwhite seabreamin North East Atlantic (NEA) and Mediterranean Sea (MS) aswell as the influence of historical and contemporary factors in this scenario using mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and nuclear (a set of 9 microsatellite) molecular markers. Azores population appeared genetically differentiated in a single cluster using Structure analysis. This result was corroborated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Monmonier algorithm which suggested a boundary to gene flow, isolating this locality. Azorean population also shows the highest significant values of FST and genetic distances for both molecular markers (microsatellites and mtDNA). We suggest that the breakdown of effective genetic exchange between Azores and the others' samples could be explained simultaneously by hydrographic (deep water) and hydrodynamic (isolating current regimes) factors acting as barriers to the free dispersal of white seabream(adults and larvae) and by historical factors which could be favoured for the survival of Azorean <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> population at the last glaciation. Mediterranean islands show similar genetic diversity to the neighbouring continental samples and nonsignificant genetic differences. Proximity to continental coasts and the current system could promote an optimal larval dispersion among Mediterranean islands (Mallorca and Castellamare) and coasts with high gene flow...|$|E
40|$|The green alga Caulerpa racemosa is a non-native, {{invasive}} {{species in the}} Mediterranean, and an important stressor for several native organisms. The algal capacity to produce secondary metabolites has been suggested to modulate success of the C. racemosa invasion, although many of potentially involved biological pathways still remain unexplored. In this respect, {{the aim of the}} present study was to investigate some molecular and cellular effects in the <b>white</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus sargus, an ecologically key species, which included the alien C. racemosa in its diet. Organisms were sampled in 2 seasonal periods from 3 locations of Southern Italy, each characterized by different levels of algal abundance. The level of caulerpin, one of the main secondary algal metabolites, in fish tissues has been used as an indicator of the trophic exposure to the seaweed and related with molecular and cellular responses. Chemical analyses indicated that fish from invaded sites can accumulate caulerpin, with liver concentrations ranging from a few up to hundreds of mg/g. Biomarkers analyses revealed only limited alterations of the main antioxidant defences, such as glutathione reductase and levels of glutathione; on the other hand, increased enzymatic activities of cytochrome P 450, glutathione S-transferases and acyl CoA oxidase, as well as enhanced gene transcription for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, cytochrome P 4501 A and vitellogenin 1 were observed in fish more exposed to C. racemosa as indicated by liver concentrations of caulerpin higher than 50 mg/g. Despite a direct molecular relationship with this algal metabolite could not be established, our results suggest that a C. racemosa enriched diet can modulate biotransformation and fatty acids metabolism of D. sargus. Assessing whether similar effects represent short- or long-term effects will be of crucial importance to understand consequences on the general health status and reproductive performance of exposed key fish species in the Mediterranean region...|$|E
