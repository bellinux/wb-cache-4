[...] The unnamed character, played by Michael Massee, is credited as [...] "Man in the shadows".|$|E
500|$|Tony Scott, {{a critic}} for Variety, thought the {{characters}} were [...] "amiable enough", but they needed [...] "sharper dialogue and fresher observations." [...] Scott {{did not think}} the carpool segment worked, but he liked the opening sequence in the bar. He also praised Lessac's direction, calling it [...] "inventive". Peter Weiniger from The Age was prepared to give the series a chance based on the episode, saying [...] "Like most American sitcoms, The Drew Carey Show {{has its share of}} snappy one-liners but it gives the impression of trying a little too hard. To be fair, this is the first of a series, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> see the characters develop. Even Seinfeld took a little time to become essential viewing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The tenth {{season was}} {{promoted}} as [...] "Season X", and Michael Weatherly dubbed it the [...] "Year of Tiva", saying, [...] "This is the year. Trust me. This is the year." [...] Cote de Pablo was more apprehensive and said, [...] "I {{think that is}} maybe Michael and his wishful thinking. I've had years in which I thought, 'Oh my God, this a Tiva year,' {{and there have been}} years he thought were Tiva years…. The truth is, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> find out where that storyline is going to go. I think they're toying around with us like they always do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kindred ‘s plot is non linear; rather, {{it begins}} {{in the middle of}} its end and {{contains}} several flashbacks that connect events in the present and past. In an interview, Butler acknowledged that she split the ending into a [...] "Prologue" [...] and an [...] "Epilogue" [...] so as to [...] "involve the reader and make him or her ask a lot of questions" [...] that could not be answered {{until the end of the}} story. Missy Dehn Kubitschek sees this framing of Dana’s adventures as Butler’s way to highlight the significance of slavery to what Americans consider their contemporary identity. Because [...] "Prologue" [...] occurs before Dana travels in time and [...] "Epilogue" [...] concludes with a message on the necessity to confront the past, we experience the story as Dana’s understanding of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> understand ourselves, while the [...] "Epilogue" [...] speaks about the importance of this understanding. Roslyn Nicole Smith proposes that Butler’s framing of the story places Dana literally and figuratively in media res so as to take her out of that in media res; that is, to indicate Dana’s movement from [...] "a historically fragmented Black woman, who defines herself solely on her contemporary experiences" [...] to [...] "a historically integrated identity" [...] who has knowledge of and a connection to her history.|$|E

60|$|I have {{hitherto}} {{been speaking}} of the industrial organisation of insurance schemes, labour exchanges, and economic development. Now I come to that great group of questions which {{are concerned with the}} prevention and relief of distress. We have before us the reports of the majority and minority of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law, and we see there a great and urgent body of reforms which require the attention of Parliament. The first and most costly step in the relief of distress has already been taken by the Old-Age Pensions Act, supplemented, as it will be if the Budget passes, by the removal of the pauper disqualification. By that Act we have rescued the aged from the Poor Law. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> rescue the children; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> distinguish effectively between the bonâ fide unemployed workman and the mere loafer and vagrant; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> transfer the sick, the inebriate, the feeble-minded and the totally demoralised to authorities specially concerned in their management and care.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not to {{the same}} extent. <b>We</b> haven't <b>had</b> time <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> number off all the little subdivisions and make rules for them, nor to {{elaborate}} the niceties of an immutable system. No doubt, we'll come to it." ...|$|R

6000|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> {{inquire into}} {{two things that}} lie in the words, to which there hath yet been nothing said. As, FIRST, What it is to cast out. SECOND, How it appears that Christ hath power to save or cast out? ...|$|E

60|$|In a {{wild and}} densely-wooded part of the island, far removed from those {{portions}} which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>had</b> occasion <b>to</b> describe, a band of fiendish-looking men were making arrangements {{for one of those}} unprovoked assaults which savages are so prone to make on those who settle near them.|$|R
60|$|Before the American {{settlements}} opened England's eyes to {{the stern}} reality of things, it was the romance of the New World that appealed most powerfully to the imagination, and that influenced Elizabethan literature to an extent which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>yet</b> begun <b>to</b> measure.|$|R
60|$|This being so, we draw {{attention}} to the fact that the nearest approach <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> made <b>to</b> the sensation of flying is that achieved by rushing down a long, smooth, steep hill-road on a well-oiled and perfect ball-bearings bicycle! Skating cannot compare with this, for that requires exertion; bicycling down hill requires none. Hunting cannot, no matter how splendid the mount, for that implies a certain element of bumping, which, however pleasant in itself, is not suggestive of the smooth swift act of flying.|$|R
60|$|A like Nemesis {{presides over}} all {{intellectual}} works. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> {{learn that the}} thing uttered in words is not therefore affirmed.

5000|$|In {{the preface}} Hume wrote: In the second place, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had great {{disappointment}} in artists.

50|$|There is also {{considerable}} {{range in}} overall guanine plus cytosine content (GC%), from 50.3% to 70%, {{with an average}} of 64% (M. smegmatis is 67.3%). Thus, phage GC% does not necessarily match that of its host, and the consequent mismatch of codon usage profiles {{does not appear to be}} detrimental. Because new mycobacteriophages lacking extensive DNA similarity with the extant collection are still being discovered, and as there are at least seven singletons for which no relatives <b>have</b> been isolated, <b>we</b> clearly <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> saturate the diversity of this particular population.|$|R
60|$|Tarrying here, {{only that}} day and night, to recruit after our late fatigues, we started off once more upon our last journey in America. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> five days <b>to</b> spare before embarking for England, and I had a great desire to see 'the Shaker Village,' which is peopled by a {{religious}} sect from whom it takes its name.|$|R

But when agri-culture has turned the unfruitful acres into 'arva beata,'--if then the plant thrust itself between the furrows of the plough, it is properly called 'Arvensis.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A moment yet!" [...] I cried. [...] "We have {{disposed}} of that, {{but there was}} another point, an earlier one, which for the moment we have disregarded.

60|$|But {{bad news}} came. The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, {{and said we}} must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain imprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days! So we took up the anchor and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, taking in supplies, and then sail for Constantinople. It was the bitterest {{disappointment}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> experienced. <b>To</b> lie a whole day in sight of the Acropolis, and <b>yet</b> be obliged <b>to</b> go away without visiting Athens! Disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|An Indian Briton, Dadabhai Naoroji, {{stood for}} {{election}} to parliament for the Liberal Party in 1886.

This led to much discussion about the applicability of the term [...] "black" [...] to South Asians. Naoroji was elected to parliament in 1892, becoming the first Member of Parliament (MP) of Indian descent.|$|R
