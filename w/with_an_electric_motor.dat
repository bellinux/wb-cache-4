5000|$|ActiveHybrid 7 and ActiveHybrid 7L models introduced. These initial hybrid models use a {{turbocharged}} 4.4 litre V8 engine <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
2500|$|PML Flightlink {{developed}} a prototype series-hybrid conversion, called [...] "Mini QED", replacing the drivetrain <b>with</b> <b>an</b> [...] <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> in each wheel and an efficient on-board petrol generator.|$|R
25|$|The EV {{is based}} on the 2LT model, and adds unique alloy wheels with black-painted accents, replaces the I4 engine and 6-speed {{automatic}} transmission <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> a fixed, 3.87 ratio reduction gear, and closes off the front grill due to being entirely electric.|$|E
25|$|The Electro Trike was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category and the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules. It was first developed by taking the existing DTA Alizés carriage and its Ellipse Fuji wing and replacing the internal combustion engine <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Firefly {{was created}} by {{replacing}} the engine of the S-300C light helicopter, {{which has been in}} use for nearly half a century, during which time more than 3,000 have been built. The S-300C's Lycoming 190-horsepower, 5.9-liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engine was replaced <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> new motor mount and two battery packs located {{on each side of the}} pilot. The rotor control, transmission and other systems were left essentially unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{was based}} on the Lotus Europa S, and {{combined}} a lithium-ion battery pack <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 200-kilowatt <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> capable of generating [...] and [...] of torque.|$|R

25|$|The car's 3-phase AC {{induction}} {{electric motor}} produced 137 brake horsepower (102kW) at 7000 rpm. Like electric trains and all vehicles <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> (and unlike a car powered by an internal combustion engine), the EV1 could deliver its full torque capacity throughout its power band, producing 110 pound-feet (149 newton-meters) of torque anywhere between 0 and 7000 rpm, allowing {{the omission of}} a manual or automatic gearbox. Power was delivered to the front wheels through a single-speed reduction integrated transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{design team}} also {{attempted}} to minimize {{changes in the}} aircraft's trim at varying speeds, thus reducing the pilot's workload. They were so successful in this regard that they found in-flight-adjustable aileron and rudder trim tabs were not necessary. Small, fixed tabs were fitted to control surfaces and adjusted for proper balance during initial test flights. Only the elevator trim needed to be adjusted in flight (a feature common to all aircraft). This was accomplished by tilting the entire horizontal tailplane <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> with an angle of incidence ranging from −3° to +5°.|$|E
25|$|The new Insight {{includes}} Honda’s {{fifth and}} latest generation of its Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This system mates an {{internal combustion engine}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> mounted directly to the engine’s crankshaft between the engine and transmission. Honda states that this configuration is less complex, lower cost, and compact enough to accommodate {{a wide range of}} vehicle sizes when compared to competing hybrid powertrains. Honda has used previous generations of this IMA system on all of its production hybrid vehicles including the original Insight, Civic Hybrid, and Accord Hybrid. Advanced development has allowed the Insight’s IMA system to be 19 percent smaller and 28 percent lighter than the previous generation IMA used in the existing Civic Hybrid.|$|E
5000|$|A {{prototype}} of the Touran Hybrid was shown <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] petrol engine, the transmission {{will most likely be}} Volkswagen's Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG).|$|R

50|$|The Antares is a glider {{built by}} Lange Aviation {{produced}} {{with three different}} wingspans, 18, 20 and 23 meters. The 20 and 23 meter variants can be equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 42-kW <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and SAFT VL 41M lithium-ion batteries.|$|R
25|$|The steeple, surmounted by a cross, {{consists}} of two sections. The first section is a square with each corner of the square marked by three engaged columns in the Ionic order. On each façade is an arched window. The four façades are topped with pediments ornamented with a circle. The cathedral's three bells are located inside this section and are decorated with religious motifs. Cast by the Crouzet-Hildebrand Foundry in Paris, the bells were originally hung for swing chiming, but electric tolling hammers have since replaced the long ropes for stationary chiming. During the most recent restoration, following the stabilization and reinforcing of the tower's structure, the bells were re-hung for swing chiming <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> On the second section of the steeple is an octagon with each corner of the octagon marked by an engaged column in the Tuscan order. On each façade is a narrow rectangular window. The eight façades are topped with pediments.|$|E
25|$|An {{ice cream}} maker is a machine {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.|$|E
500|$|The incline's {{original}} {{steam engine}} was disconnected on January6, 1912, and replaced <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The cars {{used on the}} incline were originally double-deckers, but were reconfigured into a single-decker design in 1921. The double-decker cars had horses and wagons riding on the main, upper deck and passengers riding in a compartment below. Only one human fatality has occurred at the incline, though {{it was determined that}} the incident was not caused by the incline itself. There were two incidents in the 1920s when horses aboard the incline became spooked and leapt from the car onto the tracks below. Bethlehem Steel, the successor to Cambria Iron, sold the Johnstown Inclined Plane to the borough of Westmont in April 1935. On March17, 1936, nearly 4,000people were evacuated from Johnstown to higher ground via the incline as the Stoneycreek and Conemaugh Rivers overflowed their banks. The floodwaters continued downstream and eventually reached Pittsburgh. From February1938 to July1953, the Johnstown Traction Company operated transit buses from Johnstown to Westmont with the [...] "fully loaded public buses" [...] being carried by the incline. Bethlehem Steel stopped supplying electricity to the Johnstown Inclined Plane when the factory switched to [...] "an incompatible power system", forcing the incline to close on January31, 1962. Because of public pressure to keep the incline operating, it was reopened in July1962 after an extensive renovation, in which the electric motor was rewound, ties were replaced, and the cars were repainted.|$|E
