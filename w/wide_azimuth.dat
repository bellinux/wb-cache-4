40|$|In {{traditional}} seismic surveys, {{the firing}} time between shots {{is such that}} the shot records do not interfere in time. However, {{in the concept of}} blended acquisition, the records do overlap, allowing denser source sampling and <b>wider</b> <b>azimuths</b> in an economic way. A denser shot sampling and <b>wider</b> <b>azimuths</b> make that each subsurface gridpoint is illuminated from a larger number of angles and will therefore improve the image quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. We show that — even with very simple blending parameters like time delays — the incident wavefield at a specific subsurface gridpoint represents a dispersed time series with a “complex code”. For shot-record migration purposes, this time series must have a stable inverse. In a next step, we show that the illumination can be further improved by utilizing the surface-related multiples. This means that these multiples can be exploited to improve the incident wavefield by filling angle gaps in the illumination and/or by extending the range of angles. In this way, the energy contained in the multiples now contributes to the image, rather than decreasing its quality. One remarkable consequence of this property is that the benefits to be obtained from the improved illumination depend on the detector locations in acquisition geometries as well. We show how to quantify the contribution of the blended surface multiples to the illuminating wavefield for a blended source configuration. Results confirm that the combination of blending and multiple scattering increases the illumination energy and, therefore, will improve the quality of shot-record migration results beyond today’s capability.

30|$|A {{fundamental}} factor considered in seismic data acquisition is efficiency. Simultaneous-source acquisition uses simultaneous shooting {{of two or}} more sources, resulting in the advantages of high efficiency and allowing denser source sampling and <b>wider</b> <b>azimuths</b> (Beasley 2008; Hampson et al. 2008). However, simultaneous shooting also produces blended data. There are mainly two ways to deal with simultaneous-source data. One is deblending the data (Mahdad et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2014; Chen 2015, 2016; Gan et al. 2016 a; Zu et al. 2016) and then processing the deblended data with conventional methods. The other way is imaging the simultaneous-source data directly without separation (Tang and Biondi 2009; Berkhout et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2015). The velocity analysis of simultaneous-source data can also be implemented directly to obtain a precise velocity model in the common-midpoint domain (Gan et al. 2016 b). The second approach has the advantage of high computational efficiency, but it suffers from migration artifacts because of the interference of adjacent sources.|$|R

Phased arrays offer best beam steering ability but they are balky and costly built. Alternatively, cost effective solutions {{can be achieved by}} introducing switch circuitry into simpler antenna structures like ring antennas, slot antennas, and spiral antennas. This thesis focuses on single arm rectangular spiral antennas capable to steer the beam by switches attached on the spiral. Two novel beam steering spiral antennas operating at 3. 3 GHz with wide beam coverage have been proposed. Simulation was conducted using Ansys HFSS. RF-MEMS varactors or PIN diodes are used as switches. Simulation results show <b>wider</b> <b>azimuth</b> plane coverage than existed designs because of the added bridges and extra switches. The location of the bridges and PIN diodes are determined by parametric sweep simulation process which has been detailed. In order to validate the simulation results, two antennas are fabricated using Rogers 4350 substrate and PIN diodes. They are center fed by SMA connectors with inner pin connecting the starting point of the spiral. Up to three DC biasing signals of both positive and negative voltages are required to achieve various cases for the switches. Since DC supplies are directly connected with spiral arm, biasing line, pad, and quarter wavelength stubs are needed to open circuit RF signals. Although the geometry and locations of them have been optimized, analysis indicates that these elements for biasing purposes generate errors and disagreements from simulation results. The wire connecting DC supply and range errors lead to discrepancy between simulation and measurement. Simulation and measured results for reflection coefficient, radiation pattern (both RHCP and LHCP), gain, and axial ratio are compared. Measurement methods by spinning source, two-orthogonal-cut, and cavity backed circular spiral antennas are detailed.

40|$|Mesoscale {{fractures}} {{of length}} {{on the order}} of centimeters to meters {{play a crucial role in}} fluid flow and hydrocarbon production in fractured reservoirs, and are of great interest to reservoir engineers. Therefore, we need to find a method for obtaining information on mesoscale fractures. Most information on fractures comes from seismic data, specifically through the study of fracture-induced azimuthal anisotropic attributes, such as velocity variation with azimuth (VVAZ), amplitude variation with azimuth (AVAZ) and Q (quality factor for attenuation) variation with azimuth (QVAZ). Using these anisotropic attributes to characterize fracture orientations and densities has been performed for a long time. However, it has not been reported whether these methods can be used to detect mesoscale fractures. In this study, through analysis of the anisotropic response to different lengths of fractures based on a mesoscale fracture model, we find that azimuthal anisotropic attenuation is only sensitive to mesoscale fractures, while the anisotropic velocity represents the response for overall scale fractures. Two models, containing mesoscale fractures of length 1 [*]m and microscale fractures of length 0. 01 [*]m, are used to calculate synthetic seismograms. Through analysis of the azimuthal anisotropic attributes (VVAZ, AVAZ and QVAZ) from the synthetic seismograms, the identification ability for microscale and mesoscale fractures is compared. It is observed that QVAZ can be used to invert mesoscale fractures while VVAZ and AVAZ cannot. Finally, the QVAZ method is applied in a <b>wide</b> <b>azimuth</b> 3 D P-wave seismic dataset to detect mesoscale fractures and the results are confirmed by imaging loggings.

40|$|Full {{waveform}} inversion (FWI) of seismic traces {{recorded at}} the free surface allows {{the reconstruction of}} the physical parameters structure on the underlying medium. For such a reconstruction, an optimization problem is defined, where synthetic traces, obtained through numerical techniques as finite-difference or finite-element methods in a given model of the subsurface, should match the observed traces. The number of data samples is routinely around 1 billion for 2 D problems and 1 trillion for 3 D problems while the number of parameters ranges from 1 million to 10 million degrees of freedom. Moreover, if one defines the mismatch as the standard least-squares norm between values sampled in time/frequency and space, the misfit function has a significant number of secondary minima related to the ill-posedness and the nonlinearity of the inversion problem linked to the so-called cycle skipping. Taking into account the size of the problem, we consider a local linearized method where gradient is computed using the adjoint formulation of the seismic wave propagation problem. Starting for an initial model, we consider a quasi-Newtonian method, which allows us to formulate the reconstruction of various parameters such as P and S waves velocities or density or attenuation factors.
