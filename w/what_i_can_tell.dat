6000|$|... "I am a-dry, and I {{can never}} talk with elegance when my throat is husky, captain. How much {{will you give}} to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you; let it be {{something}} handsome; such as one gentleman can offer to another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} taken my advice," [...] he said. [...] "You're going to Canada, {{and you want to}} get at <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you before you start. Here's my journal. It will jog my memory, and help us both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>what</b> am <b>I</b> {{to say to}} them? <b>What</b> {{explanation}} <b>can</b> <b>I</b> give? <b>What</b> story <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> them? Can't you {{see what}} a hole you've put me in?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{you about}} them, dear lady? Shall I carry {{perfumes}} to the rose? <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that you}} do not know so much better than myself?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... said. [...] "I {{just love}} playing it. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you — it's just my thing... The mind is very willing {{and the body}} is still pretty strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are afraid}} of running a little risk," [...] she muttered--"a very small risk! Remember {{that it would be}} a fortune. With <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you it would be a fortune for both of us, and no one need know that it was us." ...|$|E
6000|$|This frank {{expression}} of regard {{brought about a}} moment of emotional tension, and Ben hesitated before replying. At last he said: [...] "I hope I shall always deserve your confidence. I wish I had the wisdom you credit me with. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Senor," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "that is a {{question}} which you must excuse my child from answering. Not, sir, from want of will, for she is docile and obedient, though I say it, {{but there is no}} answer beyond <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. And this is, sir, that all creatures, whether man or bird, have the voice that God has given them; and in some the voice is musical and in others not so." ...|$|E
5000|$|Matthews {{continued}} to be an integral member of the NSW side during the 1995-96 season. [...] "Cricket's my thing", Matthewssaid. [...] "I just love playing it. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you — it's just my thing... The mind is very willing and the body is still pretty strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if you modify, you are lost!" [...] she exulted. [...] "For you {{can only}} modify in the {{direction}} of my position, which is neither so Jesuitical nor so harsh as you have defined it. But don't let us get lost in dialectics. I want to see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, so <b>tell</b> me about this woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, mademoiselle, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} you do not already know? The Scarlet Pimpernel {{is a man who has}} devoted his entire {{existence}} to the benefit of suffering mankind. He has but one thought, and that is for those who need him; he hears but one sound the cry of the oppressed." ...|$|R
6000|$|The man {{was simply}} irresistible. Beaucourt sat down resignedly on the nearest {{of the hall}} chairs. Dick asked {{him to return to}} the dining-room. [...] "No," [...] he said; [...] "it's not worth while. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you may be told in two minutes." [...] Dick submitted, and took the next of the hall chairs. In that {{inappropriate}} place the young lord's unpremeditated confession was forced out of him, by no more formidable exercise of power than the kindness of his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Beldonald? Doesn't {{see what}} we see, you mean, than if she does? Ah I give that up!" [...] I laughed. [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you is why I hold that, as I said just now, we can do most. We can do this: we can give to a {{harmless}} and sensitive creature hitherto practically disinherited--and give with an unexpectedness that will immensely add to its price--the pure joy of a deep draught of the very pride of life, of an acclaimed personal triumph in our superior sophisticated world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{well you}} might! This convent {{is in the}} very line of the fire. They have four great bombards placed, {{every one of them}} with a devilish Netherland name of its own. There is Houpembiere,--that means the beer- barrel, I take it,--and La Rouge Bombarde, and Remeswalle and Quincequin, every one {{shooting}} stone balls thirty inches in girth. The houses on the bridge are a heap of stones, the mills are battered down, and we must grind our meal in the city, in a cellar, for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> Nom Dieu! when they take the boulevard we lose the river, and if once they bar our gates to the east, whence shall viands come?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then, in {{the midst}} of the five {{thousand}} horsemen, we moved down upon the ford. As we reached its brink I noted that the two divisions of tribesmen were already entering the stream half a mile to the right and left of us. Of <b>what</b> befell them <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> nothing from observation, although I learned later that they forced it after great slaughter on both sides.|$|R
6000|$|What coom to t' {{three hundred}} and fifty rupees? Thot's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarcelins <b>tell</b> yo', but we melted it--we melted it. It was share an' share alike, for Mulvaney said: [...] "If Learoyd got hold of Mrs. DeSussa first, sure, 'twas I that remimbered the Sargint's dog just in the nick av time, an' Orth'ris was the artist av janius that made a work av art out av that ugly piece av ill-nature. Yet, by way av a thank-offerin' that I was not led into felony by that wicked ould woman, I'll send a thrifle to Father Victor for the poor people he's always beggin' for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Till mayhap my {{grandfather}} {{can move the}} Queen {{to do something for}} us; or till Madame de Selinville sees a face she likes better than her brother's carving; or, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell?</b> till malice is tired out, and Heaven's will sets us free. May Eustacie only have reached home! But I'm sorry for you, my poor Phil.' ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{get up to}} London--and now I {{really am}} anxious to get [...] there--I can write to you more at my ease, and more freely [...] than I do here. I know that I am hardly myself among these [...] people,--or rather, I am hardly myself as you know me, and [...] as I hope you always will know me. But, nevertheless, I am [...] not so {{overcome}} by the miasma but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you how [...] truly I love you. Even though my spirit should be here, [...] which it is not, my heart {{would be on the}} Allington lawns. [...] That dear lawn and that dear bridge! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is the use}} of it all?" [...] thought Deronda, as {{he threw}} down his grammar, and began to undress. [...] "I can't do {{anything}} to help her--nobody can, if she has found out her mistake already. And {{it seems to me that}} she has a dreary lack of the ideas that might help her. Strange and piteous to human flesh like that might be, wrapped round with fine raiment, her ears pierced for gems, her head held loftily, her mouth all smiling pretence, the poor soul within her sitting in sick distaste of all things! But what do I know of her? There may be a demon in her to match the worst husband, for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> She was clearly an ill-educated, worldly girl: perhaps she is a coquette." ...|$|E
60|$|The affliction {{which has}} befallen me has left certain duties to be {{performed}} that require my presence in London. My house is let; I am staying at a hotel. My friend, Sir James (also in London on business), has rooms near mine. We breakfast and dine together in my sitting-room. For the moment solitude is dreadful to me, and yet I cannot go into society; I shrink from persons who are mere acquaintances. At Sir James's suggestion, however, one visitor at the hotel {{has been asked to}} dine with us, who claims distinction as no ordinary guest. The physician who first warned me of the critical state of my mother's health is anxious to hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> him of her last moments. His time is too precious to be wasted in the earlier hours of the day, and he joins us at the dinner-table when his patients leave him free to visit his friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] she said, [...] "be {{quiet and}} {{tell me about the}} world; tell me about {{everything}} that's ever happened, and I'll tell you--let me see, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you?--I'll tell you about Miss Montgomerie and the river party. She was left, you see, with one foot in the boat, and the other on shore." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Goldman {{published}} his second volume of memoirs, Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade. He mentioned Heat briefly, saying [...] "the reason {{you will not}} learn more about this baby in these pages is simple: to my knowledge, lawsuits are still flying." [...] He later reflected, [...] "We had troubles, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she said, simply, [...] "I must <b>tell</b> you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not <b>tell</b> Sir Thomas, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{am afraid}} to tell Blanche. I am going away, with a mind that misgives me. I am persuaded I shall not live to return to England; and, when I am dead, I believe my husband will marry again. Years ago your mother was uneasy, on her death-bed, about your future. I am uneasy, now, about Blanche's future. I promised my dear dead friend {{that you should be}} like my own child to me--and it quieted her mind. Quiet my mind, Anne, before I go. Whatever happens in years to come--promise me to be always, what you are now, a sister to Blanche." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, now, Mr. Wilson," [...] said George, {{coming up}} and sitting himself determinately {{down in front of}} him; [...] "look at me, now. Don't I sit before you, every way, just as much a man as you are? Look at my face,--look at my hands,--look at my body," [...] and the young man drew himself up proudly; [...] "why am I not a man, as much as anybody? Well, Mr. Wilson, hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. I had a father--one of your Kentucky gentlemen--who didn't think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dogs and horses, to satisfy the estate, when he died. I saw my mother put up at sheriff's sale, with her seven children. They were sold before her eyes, one by one, all to {{different}} masters; and I was the youngest. She came and kneeled down before old Mas'r, and begged him to buy her with me, that she might have at least one child with her; and he kicked her away with his heavy boot. I saw him do it; and the last that I heard was her moans and screams, when I was tied to his horse's neck, to be carried off to his place." ...|$|E
60|$|Let {{me think}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> {{you of the}} President. I have never seen his face, though he has driven past me in the boulevards, and past these windows constantly, but {{it is said that}} he is very like his portraits--and, yes, rumour and the gazettes speak of his riding well. Wilson and Wiedeman had an {{excellent}} view of him the other day as he turned into a courtyard to pay some visit, and she tells me that his carriage was half full of petitions and nosegays thrown through the windows. What a fourth act of a play we are in just now! It is difficult to guess at the catastrophe. Certainly he must be very sure of his hold on the people to propose repealing the May edict,[6] and yet there are persons who persist in declaring that nobody cares for him and that even a revision of the constitution will not bring about his re-election. I am of an opposite mind; though there is not much overt enthusiasm of the population in behalf of his person. Still, this may arise from a quiet resolve to keep him where he is, and an assurance that he can't be ousted in spite of the people and army. It is significant, I think, that Emile de Girardin should stretch out a hand (a little dirty, be it observed in passing), and that Lamartine, after fasting nineteen days and nights (a miraculous fast, without fear of the 'prefect'), should murmur a 'credo' in favour of his honesty. As to honesty, 'I do believe he's honest;' that is to say, he has acted out no dishonesty as yet, and we have no right to interpret doubtful texts into dishonorable allegations. But for ambition--for ambition! Answer from the depth of your conscience, 'de profundis.' Is he or is he not an ambitious man? Does he or does he not mean in his soul to be Napoleon the Second? Yes, yes--I think, you think, we all think.|$|E
5000|$|Jeff Mattas of Shacknews has {{commented on}} the early parts of the game by saying [...] "I've only played a short bit of it so far, myself, but from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> it's well written and funny, and seems to do an adept job at {{capturing}} the irreverent style and humor of its six official predecessors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} stand {{senseless}} before her father's paintings? Faith, {{you are a}} very grateful lad! But so it is, and I am not one of those blind folk who see not what is under their eyes. And now, <b>what</b> now? Well, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. You are to be healed, and follow these flags to war, and win your spurs, and much wealth by ransoms, and so make my lass your lady. Is it not so?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{began his}} fictional news reports with [...] "Good evening, and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you?" [...] and closed with [...] "Guess what, folks? That's the news, and I am outta here!" [...] Fans of SNL became {{accustomed}} to his smirky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair idiosyncrasies {{that would be}} spoofed by Dana Carvey, Tom Hanks, and Jimmy Fallon, {{all of whom have}} impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left SNL in 1991, the anchor's chair was turned over to Kevin Nealon.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, Lorne Michaels {{returned}} {{to produce the}} show, bringing the Weekend Update name with him. The new anchor was Dennis Miller, who remained in the chair for six years, the longest run for a solo Weekend Update anchor. Miller opened the segments by saying [...] "Good evening, and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> ya?" [...] and signed off by saying [...] "Guess what, folks? That's the news, and I am outta here!" [...] He would then scribble nonsense on his script, sometimes throwing it into the air. Miller left in 1991.|$|R
5000|$|Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) {{initiated}} his allotted 20 {{minutes of}} questioning by asking Alito {{if the president}} has the authority to [...] "invade Iran tomorrow without getting permission from the people, from the United States Congress, absent him being able to show there's an immediate threat to our national security?" [...] Alito responded to Senator Biden's questioning with [...] "... <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you is that I have not studied these authorities and it is not my practice to just express an opinion on a constitutional question including particularly one that is as momentous as this." ...|$|E
5000|$|On October 31, 2011, {{after the}} release of subpoenaed documents, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer stated he found out about gunwalking in Operation Wide Receiver in April 2010, and that he wished he had alerted the deputy or the {{attorney}} general at the time. [...] The following day, in testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee in a hearing on International Organized Crime, when asked if he had reviewed the letter before it was sent to Senator Charles Grassley on February 4, 2011, denying gunwalking, Breuer replied, [...] "I cannot say for sure whether I saw a draft of the letter that was sent to you. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you, Senator, is that at that time I was in Mexico dealing with the very real issues that we're all so committed to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sam was {{introduced}} as the estranged wife of Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker). Tucker told Jackie Brygel of TV Week that {{during a meeting}} to discuss his character's return to the show, it was [...] "loosely" [...] mentioned {{that he could have}} a wife. The idea was later used. Dan initially kept his marital status a secret until he developed feelings for Libby Kennedy (Valentine). He decided to be honest with her before their relationship went any further. Their conversation prompted Dan to get in contact with Sam. Tucker said [...] "Dan realises he has got a few things to sort out with his ex. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you is that his past involved a lot of pain and turmoil. He now knows that he has to dredge all that up again so that he can move on completely and perhaps start a new relationship with Libby." [...] Dan had mixed emotions when Sam then turned up Erinsborough, while Libby could see that there was still something between the two of them. Buchanan thought the Sam/Dan/Libby triangle was an interesting storyline. She explained that Sam was unaware of Libby and [...] "innocently comes back into the picture". Buchanan did not think either of the women were the villain in the situation.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2001, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that Doherty would be departing Charmed. Following the announcement, rumors circulated {{that the reason}} behind Doherty's departure was because of a feud with Milano. Doherty told Entertainment Tonight that [...] "there was too much drama on the set and not enough passion for the work", {{and that there were}} never any problems between her and Combs. During an interview on Watch What Happens Live in 2013, Milano spoke about the rumored feud between her and Doherty, after a caller asked for the truth behind Doherty's departure. Milano said, [...] "I don't know if she got fired, we never really found out <b>what</b> happened. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you that we were on the air with her for three years and there were definitely some rough days. Holly and Shannen were best friends for like 10 years before the show started so it was very much sort of like high school. I would hope that in our thirties it wouldn't feel like that anymore." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "As for Husayn <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you {{concerning}} him? Be {{careful not}} to confront him except in a good way. Extend to him a free hand , and let him roam the earth as he pleases. Do not harm him, yet show him the thunder and lightening [...] Never confront him with the weapons of war but rather bestow on him generous gifts. Give him {{a place of honor}} near you and treat him with due reverence. Be careful O my son, that you do not meet God with his blood, lest you be among those that will perish" ...|$|R
5000|$|Marr {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 1989, [...] "People are always saying that everything in comedy stems from Lenny -- that everything touches him. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you? He took after me!" [...] In addition to her work as a comic and an actress, Marr served as a talent spotter. She discovered Tommy Chong, Cheech Marin, Pat Morita, and Sam Kinison. Sally Marr died on December 14, 1997, about two weeks shy of her 91st birthday, in Los Angeles. She was survived by her granddaughter, Kitty Bruce, the daughter of Lenny Bruce and his ex-wife Honey Harlow.|$|R
