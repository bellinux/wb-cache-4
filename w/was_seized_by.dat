5|$|A second expedition, {{under the}} praetor Publius Varinius, was then {{dispatched}} against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius {{seems to have}} split his forces {{under the command of}} his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, but neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the slaves.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations. In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to Tallinn, where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. By 1960, she had been broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Black Osprey, still registered in the neutral-United States, <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> British authorities on 6 September and detained at Weymouth. After carefully inspecting the ship for any contraband, the British released the ship after a week. However, on 31 October, the British again seized Black Osprey, and had not yet released her by 8 November, when the U.S. State Department released a list of 40 American ships that had been detained by belligerents.|$|E
5|$|Alfonso XIII {{served in}} the Spanish fleet from 1915 to 1937. Spain {{remained}} neutral during World War I, and so Alfonso XIII and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war. She and her sisters participated in the Rif War, where they provided gunfire support to Spanish Army forces. The ship <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> General Francisco Franco at {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War. While steaming off Santander on 30 April 1937, she struck a mine and sank; most of her crew was taken off by the destroyer Velasco.|$|E
5|$|American Continental went {{bankrupt}} in April 1989, and Lincoln <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the FHLBB on April 14, 1989. About 23,000 customers {{were left with}} worthless bonds. Many investors, often ones living in California retirement communities, lost their life savings, and felt emotional damage for having been duped {{on top of their}} financial devastation. The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million. The federal government was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, George Washington was interned by the then-neutral United States, until that country entered into the conflict in April 1917. George Washington <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the United States and taken over {{for use as a}} troop transport by the U.S. Navy. Commissioned as USS George Washington (ID-3018), she sailed with her first load of American troops in December 1917.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E

Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to Marcus Lepidus, who conspired against him. The inheritance of Nero, Agrippina's {{son and the}} future emperor, <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> Caligula. Gaetulicus, a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they too are lost.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Alsace {{was one of}} {{the main}} battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They {{surrendered}} the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau was {{returned}} to troopship duties after the project was abandoned, but at 12:02 on 2 May 1943, she was sunk by a mine off Gedser. Potsdam was converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen, where she spent {{the remainder of the}} war. Following the German defeat, the ship <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the British on 20 June 1946 as a war prize, who commissioned her as a troop transport under the name Empire Fowey. She was sold to Pakistan, who operated her under the name Safina-E-Hujjaj until she was broken up for scrap in 1976.|$|E

5|$|Laid up in Trieste harbor, Italy, by the war, the Rex <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> Nazi Germany when Italy {{surrendered}} in 1943. On September 8, 1944, she {{was attacked}} twice by Royal Air Force and South African Air Force Beaufighters. She {{was set on}} fire, then rolled over and sank after being struck by numerous rockets and cannon shells. The purpose of the attack was to prevent her from being used to block the harbor entrance. The wreck was partially scrapped in the 1950s, but around one-third of it still remains.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the Rosetta Stone. It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum. It <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801. It is now on display at the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a casino}} in the 1920s, the Rosendale Theater <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> {{the village and}} {{converted}} into a theater in 1949 by Anthony Cacchio, a man who bore a strong resemblance to filmmaker Otto Preminger. The first film shown on opening night in February 1949 was Blood on the Moon. Caccio owned the building outright by 1954, and operated it with his son, Anthony Cacchio Jr., who banned popcorn in the theater in 1969. The theater served as the village's fire department at one point.|$|E

5|$|Sandgate {{was taken}} by Parliament in 1642 {{at the start of}} the first English Civil War, and <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> Royalist rebels in the second civil war of 1648. The castle was {{extensively}} redesigned between 1805 and 1808 during the Napoleonic Wars. The height of the castle was significantly reduced and the keep was turned into a Martello tower; when the work was completed, it was armed with ten 24-pounder (11kg) guns and could hold a garrison of 40 men.|$|E
5|$|The {{considerable}} Belgian gold reserves, {{on which}} the Belga had been secured, were mostly transported to Britain, Canada and the United States before the German invasion. Over 198 tonnes, however, had been entrusted to the Banque de France before the war, and shipped to Dakar in French West Africa. Under the pro-German Vichy régime, the gold <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the Germans, who used it to buy munitions from neutral Switzerland and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{while other}} European sovereigns were {{building}} luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics {{and common sense}} demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco {{one of the most}} unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.|$|E
