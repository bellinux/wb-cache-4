50|$|In {{fact there}} are several ways the {{rotation}} might cause such a deflection. By far the best way to know what actually happens in typical cases is by wind tunnel experiments. Lyman Briggs made a definitive <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>study</b> of the Magnus effect on baseballs, and others have produced interesting images of the effect. The studies show a turbulent wake behind the spinning ball. The wake is to be expected and is the cause of aerodynamic drag. However there is a noticeable angular deflection in the wake and the deflection is {{in the direction of the}} spin.|$|E
50|$|Wind loading {{is another}} major design {{criterion}} in Hong Kong {{as it is}} situated in an area influenced by typhoons. Not only must the structure be able to resist the loads generally and the cladding system and its fixings resist higher local loads, but the building must also perform dynamically in an acceptable manner such that predicted movements lie within acceptable standards of occupant comfort criteria. To ensure that {{all aspects of the}} building's performance in strong winds will be acceptable, a detailed <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>study</b> was carried out by Professor Alan Davenport at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario.|$|E
5000|$|Wind {{load acting}} on the {{building}} {{is the result of}} wind blowing on the building. This wind pressure must be resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building. Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in hurricane-prone regions. For each project location, building codes specify the required design wind loads. Often, a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>study</b> is performed on large or unusually shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures {{acting on the}} structure in question.

50|$|As with {{everything}} else, triathletes often strive {{to make their}} water bottles as aerodynamic as possible, and often to reduce the need to reach for a water bottle - which may interrupt pedaling and slow the racer down. Triathletes have tried placing water bottles in unusual locations, such as in a bracket behind the saddle, {{on the theory that}} the bottles are shielded from the wind by the body. However, a recent wind-tunnel study by Triathlete Magazine discovered that this approach is actually counterproductive because it interrupts the laminar flow of air down the athlete's curved back. A 2003, <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>study</b> by Dan Empfield found that the best configuration was a single water bottle on the bike's downtube (it smoothed airflow to the seat tube and rear wheel). This caused less drag than having no waterbottle at all. The most drag was 2 water bottles; one on the down tube and one on the seat tube.|$|E
5000|$|Gunners at CARDE {{suggested}} that firing models out of existing gun barrels would permit gathering data at much lower cost, and guided Bull in this direction. As a proof of concept, they tried an Ordnance QF 17-pounder barrel bored to 3.9 in The aerodynamicists' demands to accommodate larger models resulted in boring out a BL 5.5 inch Medium Gun barrel {{to produce a}} 5.9 in smooth-bore. Borrowing an idea developed in England in 1916, cards were placed on holders along the range and scaled models of the missile fired through them. The models were carried in a segmented aluminum sabot, which peeled away as the round left the muzzle. As originally built the range was 1000 yd long, with [...] "jump cards" [...] located at 100 yd intervals. A metallic coating on the cards permitted timing of flight progress to measure velocity. One station was equipped for Schlieren spark photography to record the shock waves and wake around the projectile. In some ways this technique was superior to <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>study,</b> as it allowed for the direct measurement of real-world influences on the trajectory, {{as a test of}} theoretical calculations. On the downside, reducing the collected data to a mathematical trajectory for checking against the theoretical calculations is difficult.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{experimentally}} determined 3 -D velocity information {{is crucial to}} the understanding of highly 3 -dimensional and vortical flow fields. In addition to gaining an understanding of the physics of flow fields, a correlation of velocity data is needed for advanced computational modelling. A double pass method for acquiring 3 -D flow field information using a 2 -D laser velocimeter (LV) is described. The design and implementation of a 3 -D LV with expanded capabilities to acquire real-time 3 -D flow field information are also described. Finally, the use of such an instrument in a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>study</b> of a generic fighter configuration is described.

The Reynolds numbers determined {{for the end of}} transition were consistent with those obtained from <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>studies.</b> Maximum surface-pressure-fluctuation coefficients in the transition region were about an order of magnitude greater than those for fully developed turbulent flow. This was also consistent with <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> data. It was also noted that the power-spectral-density estimates of the surface-pressure fluctuations were characterized by a shift in power from high frequencies to low frequencies as the boundary layer changed from turbulent to laminar flow.

50|$|Later, {{still at}} Ames, Jones {{promoted}} {{the idea of}} an oblique wing. (The first known oblique wing design was Blohm & Voss P202, proposed by Richard Vogt in 1942.) His <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>studies</b> indicated that such a wing design on a supersonic transport might achieve twice the fuel economy of an aircraft with conventional wings. The concept was flight tested successfully on the NASA AD-1. This unique plane had a wing which pivoted about the fuselage, remaining perpendicular to it during slow flight and rotating to angles of up to 60 degrees as aircraft speed increased. Analytical and <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>studies</b> that Jones conducted at Ames indicated that a transport-sized oblique-wing aircraft flying at speeds of up to Mach 1.4 (1.4 times the speed of sound) would have substantially better aerodynamic performance than aircraft with conventional wings. A current DARPA project that has been awarded to Northrop Grumman, called the Switchblade is being developed to provide a more efficient UAV for the Air Force.|$|R
