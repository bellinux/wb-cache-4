5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary <b>water</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the reactor}} control rods are {{inserted}} from above; 24 shortened rods are inserted from below {{and are used}} to augment the axial power distribution control of the core. With the exception of 12 automatic rods, the control rods have a [...] long graphite section at the end, separated by a [...] long telescope (which creates a water-filled space between the graphite and the absorber), and a boron carbide neutron absorber section. The role of the graphite section, known as [...] "displacer," [...] is to enhance {{the difference between the}} neutron flux attenuation levels of inserted and retracted rods, as the graphite displaces water that would otherwise act as a neutron absorber, although much weaker than boron carbide; a control rod channel filled with graphite absorbs fewer neutrons than when filled with water, so the difference between inserted and retracted control rod is increased. When the control rod is fully retracted, the graphite displacer is located {{in the middle of the}} core height, with 1.25m of water at each of its ends. The displacement of water in the lower 1.25m of the core as the rod moves down causes a local increase of reactivity in the bottom of the core as the graphite part of the control rod passes that section. This [...] "positive scram" [...] effect was discovered in 1983 at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The control rod channels are cooled by an independent <b>water</b> <b>circuit</b> and kept at [...] The narrow space between the rod and its channel hinders water flow around the rods during their movement and acts as a fluid damper, which is the primary cause of their slow insertion time (nominally 18–21 seconds for the RCPS rods, or about 0.4m/s). After the Chernobyl disaster, the control rod servos on other RBMK reactors were exchanged to allow faster rod movements, and even faster movement was achieved by cooling of the control rod tubes by a thin layer of water while letting the rods themselves move in gas.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the very}} high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid Invar and tipped with thoriated tungsten.

In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional <b>water</b> cooling <b>circuit</b> for each electrode is necessary.

40|$|The EMU {{incorporates}} {{two separate}} <b>water</b> <b>circuits</b> for {{the rejection of}} metabolic heat from the astronaut and the cooling of electrical components. The first (the Transport Water Loop) circulates in a semi-closed-loop manner and absorbs heat into a Liquid Coolant and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) warn by the astronaut. The second (the Feed Water Loop) provides water to a cooling device (Sublimator) with a porous plate, and that water subsequently sublimates to space vacuum. The cooling effect from the sublimation of this water translates to a cooling of the LCVG water that circulates through the Sublimator. Efforts are underway to streamline {{the use of a}} water processing kit (ALCLR) that is being used to periodically clean and disinfect the Transport Loop Water.

40|$|Background. InvasiveMycobacterium {{chimaera}} infections {{were diagnosed}} in 2012 in 2 heart surgery patients on extracorporeal circulation. We launched an outbreak investigation {{to identify the}} source and extent of the potential outbreak and to implement preventive measures. Methods. We collected water samples from operating theaters, intensive care units, and wards, including air samples from operating theaters. Mycobacterium chimaera strains were characterized by randomly amplified poly-morphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Case detection was performed based on archived histopa-thology samples and M. chimaera isolates since 2006, and the patient population at risk was prospectively surveyed. Results. We identified 6 male patients aged between 49 and 64 years with prosthetic valve endocarditis or vas-cular graft infection due toM. chimaera, which became clinically manifest with a latency of between 1. 5 and 3. 6 years after surgery. Mycobacterium chimaera was isolated from cardiac tissue specimens, blood cultures, or other biopsy specimens. We were able also to culture M. chimaera from <b>water</b> <b>circuits</b> of heater-cooler units connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass, and air samples collected when the units were in use.

There are two main types of nonlinearities in a steam {{generating unit}} automation control system.
