500|$|While the {{presentation}} was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. [...] More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> {{the game for}} its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated [...] "Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are {{more interesting than the}} actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's never a good thing." [...] Critics also agreed that the game felt too short.|$|E

2500|$|In 1654, {{prompted}} {{by his friend}} the Chevalier de Méré, he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat {{on the subject of}} gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities. The specific problem was that of two players who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. [...] From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pensées) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the calculus.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{received}} mixed commentary {{in regards}} to gameplay. [...] The reviewer for Official Xbox Magazine noted that its [...] "combat and controls are quite good, and yet it feels a bit sleepy."

[...] GameSpot's Brett Todd agreed and also expressed disappointment with the lack of online multiplayer. [...] Tyler Cameron of XBLA Fans also noted frustration with Aquas escort missions but lauded the campaign length. [...] "Most XBLA titles are short and can often be finished in a day [...] Aqua’s campaign feels appropriate for the price, and doesn’t overstay its welcome." [...] Cameron further noted that the game's replay value is extended by hidden items and other features to discover in the campaign. [...] 1UP.com's Eric Neigher appreciated the game's basic gameplay. [...] He called it a [...] "simple game with a lot of simple fun to be had." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed gave high remarks {{in regards to}} Aquas customization and upgrade system which when combined with the game's story gives Aqua [...] "a personality of its own." [...] GameZone's David Sanchez gave the PC version a 4.5 out of 10. He stated [...] "Naval Warfare shouldn’t take you too long to play through. But because the game gets boring so fast, you’re not going to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> the entire adventure. The game has some redeeming qualities in its Skirmish and multiplayer modes, but these are short-lived." ...|$|E
