I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

500|$|Terrance Dicks {{has felt}} that Moonbase 3 was {{ultimately}} a failure: [...] "The trouble was <b>we</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> too restrictive format for ourselves" [...] {{and that the}} series [...] "lacked a sense of wonder and outrageousness". [...] Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its [...] "appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt (and often desired) in Britain in the early 1970s". [...] Moonbase 3, although not directly influential, {{can be seen as}} an antecedent of similar realistic, near-future, British space series such as Star Cops and Space Island One.|$|E
500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, <b>we</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> rig that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required." ...|$|E
500|$|The entire freeway {{road was}} built with {{expansion}} in mind; almost all bridges were built {{wide enough for}} expansion to the ultimate stage which includes {{as many as six}} main travel lanes in one direction, depending on location. [...] Alberta plans to widen the southwest leg of the road, which is well over capacity, but the plans are currently unfunded until at least 2020. [...] They include widening both directions from two to three travel lanes in the congested southwest section between Highway 2 and Whitemud Drive, and the more extensive work required to widen the bridges over the North Saskatchewan River and Wedgewood Ravine which are currently two lanes of travel per bridge each way. [...] In 2015, city councillor Michael Oshry stated that he was unhappy with the way the road was initially constructed, and Alberta should {{have done a better job}} of anticipating the rapid growth in southwest Edmonton. Project manager Bill van der Meer disagreed, saying, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> six-lane divided road that was virtually empty for 10years, that wouldn’t be money well spent." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. <b>We</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
2500|$|Plymouth product {{planning}} director Jack Charipar gave impetus for a stock car racing {{version of the}} Valiant, and while Chrysler engineers developed the Hyper-Pak for the track, the Hyper-Pak dealer tuning kit option was made available in limited quantities on December 1, 1959. Features included [...] of torque, a 10.5:1 compression ratio, dual exhaust pipes on a single muffler, a manual choke and a larger [...] fuel tank. Dick Maxwell, a Chrysler engineer responsible {{for many of the}} Super Stock Mopars, recalls that [...] "When NASCAR decided to run a compact road race in conjunction with the 1960 Daytona 500, all the factories got involved. <b>We</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> fleet of seven Hyper Pak Valiants with 148-hp 170-ci [...] sixes having a single four-barrel with ram manifold."

60|$|At Jupiter Inlet, about {{a hundred}} and fifty miles from our point of starting, we went into camp, in which {{delightful}} condition we proposed to remain for a week or more. There was no trouble whatever in finding a suitable place for a camp. The spot selected was a point of land swept by cool breezes, with a palmetto forest in the rear of it. On two sides of the point stretched the clear waters of the river, while half a mile to the east was Jupiter Inlet, on each side of which rolled and tumbled the surf of the Atlantic. About a mile away was Jupiter Light-house, the only human habitation within twenty miles. <b>We</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> palmetto hut for a kitchen; we set up the tents in a permanent way; we constructed a little pier for the yacht; <b>we</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> wash-stand, a table, and a bench. And then, considering that we had actually gone into camp, we got out our fishing-lines.|$|E
