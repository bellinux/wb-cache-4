500|$|... "Letters That Cross in the Mail" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for the album. Streisand claimed that the inspiration behind the track was simple: it is [...] "about love and the postal service". Santopietro wrote that Holmes' love for of [...] "big band sound" [...] and [...] "a full symphonic orchestra" [...] {{is evident in the}} production. Following her cover of [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] in 1974, seventh track [...] "You and I" [...] is Streisand's second cover of a Stevie Wonder song. Taken from his 1972 studio album Talking Book, she called the pop song [...] "immediately [...] touch" [...] and considered Wonder [...] "brilliant" [...] for his work on it. Written by Howard Dietz and Ralph Rainger, Streisand's cover of Libby Holman's [...] "Moanin' Low" [...] appears as the eighth song. In order to place focus on the lyrics during the song, the production contains [...] "octave leaps" [...] while Streisand [...] "changes timbre frequently and quickly between loud and soft sections and high and low pitches". Ninth track [...] "A Child Is Born" [...] features a simplistic piano arrangement accompanied solely by Streisand's vocals; Columbia Records executive reacted to the track's new genre for the singer, stating, [...] "You could put Barbra in front of a rock band or a symphony orchestra, she would still be Barbra Streisand, not compromising, not uncomfortable". [...] "Widescreen", the album's closing track, was inspired by the singer's love of film; according to author Patrick E. Horrigan, it specifically explains [...] "how the movies, dark and dreamlike, seduce us into believing that life can be fulfilling, then let us down as soon as <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light of day". It was also the last of four tracks written by Holmes and has a production consisting of [...] "synthesized electronics".|$|E

2500|$|Chief Red Shirt was lionized by the British {{press and}} photographed by reporters {{wherever}} he went. His handsome features and stately bearing caused reporters {{to hang on}} his every word and he became the most quoted Wild Wester celebrity of Cody’s trip to England. Red Shirt explained to a reporter from Sheffield: “I started from my lodge two moons ago knowing nothing, and had I remained on the Native Reservations, I should have been as a blind man. [...] Now I can see a new dawn. I have seen the great houses (ships) which cross the mighty waters, the great villages which have no end where the pale faces swarm like insects in the summer sun. Our people will wonder at these things when <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Native Reservation {{and tell them what}} we have seen.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Wacław [...] "Vogg" [...] Kiełtyka {{commented on}} the album, [...] "Extreme and groove — I think that's {{the best way to}} {{describe}} our new album. This time we feel that we have something totally crushing and huge. Blood Mantra is the most heavy and mature album we ever did in our career. I cannot wait to start to play songs live because riffs are soo deep and powerful." [...] He also stated, [...] "We flirt with various tempos mixing death metal with grindcore and almost outright black metal atmosphere together with more, so to speak, 'crowd-puller' beats verging on groovy, almost stoner-rock climates. There are also a few more modern metal rhythmic riffs where <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> climate of Organic Hallucinosis album. I'm certain that the very fact we are again, after 9 years, in Hertz studio will evoke the spirit of that album. The vocals sound very promising. Rasta [...] is a much more experienced vocalist compared to the Carnival Is Forever album times. And his voice sounds more powerful and deeper." ...|$|E

And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E

60|$|As for Charles and myself, <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. Half an {{hour later}} Forbes-Gaskell came back, too, in a towering temper.|$|R

60|$|When Perry was rested <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prospector, {{where he}} fitted himself out fully like a civilized human being--under-clothing, socks, shoes, khaki jacket and {{breeches}} and good, substantial puttees.|$|R

60|$|Here {{they set}} up {{the sign of the}} Old Blue Boar.

60|$|But it is {{now time}} that <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> course of our narrative; although, ere we again enter on the {{stirring}} and rapid present, it will be necessary for a moment more to look back in another direction to the eventful past.|$|E
