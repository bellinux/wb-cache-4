5|$|Beginning in 1847 {{and lasting}} until 1996, the Canadian government, in {{partnership}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Aboriginal children, who were forcibly taken from their homes. While {{the schools were}} said to educate, they were plagued by under-funding, disease, and abuse.|$|E
5|$|He also {{promoted}} {{the creation of}} schools for women, where they would learn about weaving, as well as reading. However, he did not aim to generate intellectual women, but just to prevent ignorance and laziness, and have them learn things valuable for daily living. Being a strong Catholic himself, he was aligned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> perspective that rejected mixed-sex education, in contrast with Protestantism.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} communion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, {{the roots of the}} split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon instituted various reforms, such as higher education, a tax code, {{road and}} sewer systems, and {{established}} the Banque de France, the first central bank in French history. He negotiated the Concordat of 1801 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, {{which sought to}} reconcile the mostly Catholic population to his regime. It was presented alongside the Organic Articles, which regulated public worship in France. He dissolved the Holy Roman Empire prior to German Unification later in the 19th century. The sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States doubled {{the size of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January 1492, {{after five}} years of war, the Moorish emirate in Spain came to an end <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Monarchs' capture of Granada. The Jews of Gibraltar were, like those {{elsewhere}} in the kingdom, expelled from Spain by order of the monarchs in March that year. Gibraltar was used by Medina Sidonia as a base for the Spanish capture of Melilla in North Africa in 1497. Two years later the Muslims of Granada were ordered to convert to Christianity or leave. Those that did not convert left for North Africa, some of them travelling via Gibraltar.|$|E
50|$|Other Protestant {{denominations}} {{are significantly}} smaller, {{as are the}} Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and other non-Christian communities (totaling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> to about 1.6% of the population).|$|R
50|$|Subsequently {{the church}} {{building}} was {{given over to}} <b>the</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Church, who took it over as their cathedral the following May. The Lutherans were also forced to share Riga Cathedral <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics.</b>|$|R
50|$|St Patrick's Church is {{significant}} as <b>the</b> focus of <b>Catholic</b> worship in Fortitude Valley {{for over a}} century, the building has a strong association <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local <b>Catholic</b> community, and in particular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Irish <b>Catholic</b> community.|$|R
5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring to {{negotiate}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Party, which held power {{for much of}} his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who saw him as meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed.|$|E
5|$|The chapter-general re-elected Vermigli to the Spoletan abbacy in 1534 {{and again}} in 1535, {{but he was not}} elected to lead any house the {{following}} year. He may have been identified as a promising reformer who could help with reform efforts in higher places. Vermigli was in contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> leaders working on the Consilium de emendanda ecclesia, an internal report on potential reforms of the Church commissioned by Pope PaulIII. He may have even travelled to Rome to assist in writing it.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Meridian and its surrounds is fairly observant, with 65.2% of Lauderdale County identifying as affiliated with {{some type of}} religious congregation, compared with {{the national average of}} 50.2%. Of the affiliated in 2000, 30,068 (59.0%) were in the Southern Baptist Convention, 9,469 (18.6%) were with the United Methodist Church, and 1,872 (3.7%) were associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church.|$|E

5000|$|Cromwell {{then went}} to Ireland to govern it, but was [...] "disgusted" [...] <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics,</b> so he massacred many of them (in battle) and so the Irish rebelled against him as well.|$|R
60|$|Next year {{came the}} counter-blow. There were heavy battles <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> all round <b>the</b> neighbourhood, {{destruction}} of the suburbs, threatened siege and sack, and years of misery and poverty for Montpellier and all who were therein.|$|R
5|$|This Counter-Reformation {{offensive}} happened somewhat mysteriously in a country, {{where there}} were no religious wars and the state had not cooperated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church in eradicating or limiting competing denominations. Among the factors responsible, low Protestant involvement among the masses, especially of peasantry, pro-Catholic position of the kings, low level of involvement of the nobility once the religious emancipation had been accomplished, internal divisions within the Protestant movement, and the rising intensity of the Catholic Church propaganda, have been listed.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> realism of Henri Christophe. A key aspect {{of the novel is}} that the main character is of interest not because of his skin colour, but rather for his human attributes that allow universal reflection beyond the realm of race. In this sense, magic realism is a necessary tool of expression and the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his purpose as a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of the human experience.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} program to {{suppress}} Polish culture, the German Nazis attempted to destroy Christianity in Poland, with a particular emphasis on the Roman Catholic Church. In some parts of occupied Poland, Poles were restricted, or even forbidden, from attending religious services. At the same time, church property was confiscated, prohibitions were placed on using the Polish language in religious services, organizations affiliated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church were abolished, and it was forbidden to perform certain religious songs—or to read passages of the Bible—in public. The worst conditions {{were found in the}} Reichsgau Wartheland, which the Nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti-religious policies. Polish clergy and religious leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that were targeted for extermination.|$|E
5000|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{evolving}} relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> and <b>the</b> Italian liberal state, in the 1910s Giolitti saw a way {{to further}} his clout and sway over the masses after the extension of suffrage to all adult males.|$|R
60|$|Next year {{came the}} counter blow. There were heavy battles <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> all round <b>the</b> neighbourhood, {{destruction}} of the suburbs, threatened siege and sack, and years of misery and poverty for Montpellier and all who were therein.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} led by Prime Minister Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics {{had started}} legislating {{for the transfer}} of Baltic German St James's Church to <b>the</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Church as well as forcing the Lutheran Church to share Riga Cathedral <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics.</b> <b>The</b> moves were vigorously opposed by Paul Schiemann, a prominent defender of minority rights, who claimed the bill would [...] "abandon the principles {{of a state of}} culture and law" [...] during a parliamentary debate.|$|R
5|$|Charles, however, decreed on 22 September {{that all}} reformers must {{reconcile}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> faith, {{or he would}} use military force to suppress them. This prompted Melanchthon to call a meeting with Bucer and after lengthy discussions they agreed on nine theses, which they sent to Luther and to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg magistrates forwarded them to Basel and Zürich. Bucer met Luther in Coburg on 26–28 September. Luther still rejected Bucer's theses, but he encouraged him to continue the search for unity. Bucer then traveled to several southern German cities, including Ulm, Isny, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau, and to the Swiss cities of Basel and Zürich. In Zurich on 12 October, he presented the articles to Zwingli, who neither opposed him nor agreed with him.|$|E
5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views clashed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's tolerant policy towards the Jewish people, he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than tolerant. Following disturbances in Ravenna, where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding with the Jewish people of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Gravel then boarded at Assumption Preparatory School in Worcester, Massachusetts, {{where his}} {{performance}} was initially mediocre. Then an English teacher, the Assumptionist Edgar Bourque, gave him personal attention, improving Gravel's language skills and instructing him in public speaking. Gravel's grades improved measurably {{in his final}} year, and he graduated in 1949. He has a sister, Marguerite, who became a Holy Cross nun, but Gravel himself struggled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> faith. He studied for one year at Assumption College, a Catholic school in Worcester, then transferred for his sophomore year to American International College in Springfield. Journalist I. F. Stone and philosopher Bertrand Russell strongly influenced Gravel in their willingness to challenge assumptions and oppose social convention and political authority.|$|E

50|$|A {{minority}} of Anglo-Catholics, sometimes called Anglican Papalists, consider themselves under papal supremacy {{even though they}} are not in communion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Church. Such Anglo-Catholics, especially in England, often celebrate Mass according to <b>the</b> contemporary Roman <b>Catholic</b> rite and are concerned with seeking reunion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Church.|$|R
6000|$|Next, the brethren, {{in arguing}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> {{about their own}} mendacious {{proclamation}} of the terms, said that [...] "we proclaimed nothing which was not finally agreed upon, in word and promise, betwixt us and those <b>with</b> whom <b>the</b> Appointment was made.

5|$|In the {{following}} years, Walsingham became active in soliciting {{support for the}} Huguenots in France and developed a friendly and close working relationship with Nicholas Throckmorton, his predecessor as MP for Lyme Regis and a former ambassador to France. By 1569, Walsingham was working with William Cecil to counteract plots against Elizabeth. He {{was instrumental in the}} collapse of the Ridolfi plot, which hoped to replace Elizabeth <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Mary, Queen of Scots. He is credited with writing propaganda decrying a conspiratorial marriage between Mary and Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and Roberto di Ridolfi, after whom the plot was named, was interrogated at Walsingham's house.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E
50|$|By 1784, sectarian {{fighting}} {{had broken}} out between gangs of Protestants and <b>Catholics.</b> <b>The</b> Protestants re-organised themselves as the Peep o' Day Boys, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> forming <b>the</b> Defenders. The next decade would see an escalation in the violence between the two and the local population as homes were raided and wrecked.|$|R
2500|$|Gunthamund (484–496), {{his cousin}} and successor, sought {{internal}} peace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> and ceased persecution once more. Externally, the Vandal power had been declining since Genseric's death, and Gunthamund lost {{large parts of}} Sicily to the Ostrogoths and had to withstand increasing pressure from the [...] Moors.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s the ARP's {{strategy}} became successful, both electorally, as {{it became}} an important political actor, and politically, as {{it was able to}} form an alliance, <b>the</b> coalition, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics.</b> In 1888 this resulted in the first coalition cabinet led by Æneas Baron Mackay.|$|R
