40|$|AbstractReasonable caving {{method is}} an {{important}} guarantee of realizing high-yield and high-efficient of the working face. Based on the specific conditions of the 2637 working face in Zhaogezhuang Mine, compared extraction rates under different top coal caving technology with field tests and similar material simulation, adopted the multi-turns interval caving method and the 0. 8 m top coal caving interval, and got the best sublevel height of top coal <b>in</b> <b>steep</b> <b>seam</b> of Zhaogezhuang Mine is 9 m. The result shows {{that the loss of}} top coal caving could be controlled under 15. 4 %, and the mining rate of the coal mining face reached at 84. 68 %...|$|R
5000|$|The stress regime at {{the face}} - high stress on and around the mining face can {{have the effect of}} closing up the cleats and pores in the coal seam. This can result <b>in</b> a <b>steep</b> coal <b>seam</b> gas {{pressure}} gradient into the seam, (as opposed to a low stress environment where the coal seam gas drains freely into the face area, resulting in a low seam gas pressure gradient). As mining progresses, this pressure can be violently released, resulting in an outburst.|$|R
30|$|The <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> {{refers to}} the coal seam with the dip angle of 35 °– 55 °. Since the dip angle of coal seam is {{relatively}} large, the working face is vulnerable to the instability such as the bottom heave, slippage, etc. The drawback would induce slanting, topple and fall, gliding of hydraulic supports, etc. In this respect, {{it is challenging to}} perform coupling stability control of hydraulic support and surrounding rock. The longwall mining system instability and coal gangue splashing menace the mining safety. The <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> mining has long been a challenge in global coal mining industry. <b>In</b> China, the <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> is evenly distributed in each major mining site. The reported reserves and production account for 10 %– 20 % of the total coal reserves and 5 %– 8 % of the total coal output in the country. In addition, more than 50 % of the <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> mines are high-quality coking coal and anthracite coal. How to realize the stability coupling control of hydraulic support and surrounding rock <b>in</b> <b>steep</b> dipping working face restricts the safe and high-efficiency mining for <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> (Liu and Wang 2005; Luo 2015).|$|R

30|$|To {{accommodate}} the <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> <b>in</b> Songzao coalmine {{with an average}} angle of 64 ° the working face adopts bow pseudo-inclined layout, and the rhombus hydraulic support is introduced to keep the constant roof distance, which realizes the double supporting function for sideway and roof surrounding rock.|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of mining roadway is affected significantly by {{the condition of}} the surrounding rock and stress regime, which is the key factor for determining the roadway support program. Located in syncline axis, the No. 15 <b>seam</b> is a <b>steep</b> <b>seam</b> at - 230 m level in Changgouyu coal mine, the original flexible shield cannot meet the safety and production requirement. The No. 15 seam is classified as unstable and relatively complex according to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The distribution characteristics of stress in the seam around the synclinal axis before and after mining are analysed by use of FLAC 2 D. According to the complexity of the coal seam and the stress distribution characteristics, the supporting parameters using bolt-mesh-anchor were selected and implemented successfully in an underground roadway, which can be referred to as in the design of roadway support in similar complicated coal seams...|$|R

The purpose are {{to work out the}} rational stripping schemes and the rational development schemes for the new horizons in the united borders of adjacent collieries operating simultaneously, which exploit the <b>steep</b> <b>seams,</b> to substantiate the optimum variables and the application field of their schemes. The dependences of efficiency indicators of colliery operation on the mining-technical factors, on the stripping variables and on the development variables of new horizons have been determined. The new variants of stripping scheme s have been worked out, the horizons have been developed in the united borders of adjacent collieris. The worked out variants of stripping schemes have been introduced at the "Ziminka" colliery and at the "Tyrganskaya" colliery.

However, this mining system has to be improved to cope with <b>steeper</b> coal <b>seams</b> and water problems in the face in order to increase the extraction ratio and maintain the highwall stability.|$|R
