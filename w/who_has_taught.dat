2500|$|Professor {{of journalism}} at Elon University, Michael Skube, argued in the editorial, [...] "The No. 1 reason to rank colleges," [...] against {{arguments}} {{made in the}} 11 March Washington Post article, [...] "The Cost of Bucking College Rankings" [...] by the President of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers. Skube states that, while having some merit, these arguments were [...] "partly beside the point [...] U.S. News survey, for all its imperfections, performs the useful service of comparing apples with academic apples.In some ways, one might even argue that its nuts-and-bolts consumer information {{is at least as}} practical as the bar charts and numbers a car buyer might find in Consumer Reports or Car and Driver. What factors go into the rankings? Student retention accounts for 25% at schools U.S. News calls master's level and those that provide primarily the bachelor's degree (called 'comprehensive' schools, oddly enough)." [...] Skube also notes objections made to the reputation survey portion of the U.S. News survey and responds by stating that, [...] "one can see why." [...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. That tells me all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude as seriously as I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective. Sarah Lawrence might not care about such things, but I do." ...|$|E
