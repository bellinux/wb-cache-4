5|$|Aboriginal people, {{particularly}} the Nyoongar and Yamatji, placed the flower spike in a paperbark-lined hole filled with <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a sweet drink. Both this species and B.aemula have {{been credited with}} the inspiration behind May Gibbs' Big Bad Banksia Men; this species was familiar to Gibbs in her childhood and likely gave her the initial inspiration, although the depictions resemble the latter species. Artist Marianne North produced a highly regarded painting of B.attenuata during her stay in Australia in 1880–1881.|$|E

5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand and <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of {{the material}} from canyon deposits, {{but some of the}} clays may have been collected {{from the base of the}} cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} known for its {{medicinal}} properties and has significant anti-bacterial properties; the leaves and the root have been used to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, wounds and bone fractures by herbalists in countries like Oman. The ground leaves of Tephrosia apollinea are also inhaled to reduce nasal congestion, or boiled with <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> eardrops. Powdered bark can be mixed with water and poured into the ears of camels to alleviate ticks, and powdered leaves {{can be used as a}} paste in the treating of wounds. It can also be rubbed on limbs in conjunction with Fagonia indica and Ocomim basilicum to treat people affected with polio.|$|E

5|$|Without seismic data or {{knowledge}} of its moment of inertia, little direct {{information is available}} about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling {{at about the same}} rate. The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{understand}} the Aeroscraft’s VTOL capability is to compare the Aeroscraft to a submarine. For example, when a submarine needs to dive into the water, it takes on <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the heaviness or lightness of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{use their}} leaves to {{intercept}} sunlight. The energy {{is used to}} reduce carbon dioxide from the air with electrons from <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sugars (and other biomass) and a waste product, oxygen, {{in the process of}} photosynthesis. Leaves also respire, in a similar way to animals, by burning their biomass to generate chemical energy. This energy is temporarily stored in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which acts as an energy currency for metabolism in all living things. As a waste product, respiration produces carbon dioxide.|$|E
