5|$|The Chew Valley {{is an area}} in North Somerset, England, {{named after}} the River Chew, which rises at Chewton Mendip, and joins the River Avon at Keynsham. Technically, {{the area of the}} valley is bounded by the <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>area</b> of the Chew and its tributaries; however, the name Chew Valley is often used less {{formally}} to cover other nearby areas, for example, Blagdon Lake and its environs, which by a stricter definition are part of the Yeo Valley. The valley is an area of rich arable and dairy farmland, interspersed with a number of villages.|$|E
5|$|The Tawau Hills National Park {{established}} as a natural <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>area.</b> The park contains rugged volcanic landscapes including a hot spring and spectacular waterfalls. Bordering the Philippine Turtle Islands is the Turtle Islands National Park, it consists of three islands of Selingaan, Bakkungan Kechil and Gulisaan which is notable as the nesting place for green turtle and hawksbill sea turtle. Other important wildlife regions in Sabah include the Maliau Basin, Danum Valley, Tabin, Imbak Canyon and Sepilok. These places are either designated as national parks, wildlife reserves, virgin jungle reserves, or protection forest reserve. Beyond the coasts of Sabah lie a number of islands rich with coral reefs such as Ligitan, Sipadan, Selingaan, Tiga and Layang-Layang (Swallow Reef). Other main islands including the Jambongan, Timbun Mata, Bum Bum and the divided Sebatik. The Sabah state government has enacted several laws to protect its forests and endangered wildlife species under the Animals Ordinance 1962, Forest Enactment 1968 and the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 among others. Under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment, any persons hunting inside conservation lands are liable for imprisonment {{for five years and}} fined with RM50,000. The state government also plans to implement seasonal huntings as part of its conservation efforts to prevent the continuous lose of its endangered wildlife species while maintaining the state indigenous hunting traditions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>Catchments</b> <b>Area</b> is an {{area that}} has high {{capability}} to absorb rainfall thus it becomes a site of natural water charging of which has function as water source. By the conduction of activity of sand mining in <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area,</b> it is a bad incident towards legal protection of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area,</b> on the ground of by the existence of uncontrolled sand mining in <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> either directly or indirectly can result the destruction of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> function. Meanwhile the purpose of this research was to know the governmental efforts to protect <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> from sand mining in Sleman Regency, in particularly in Cangkringan Subdistrict. In addition the method used for collecting data was direct interview to the source person and respondent. From the research result, up till now the effort of legal protection conducted by the government towards <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> has not been fully optimal. It is caused by some matters, e. g. the inexistence of particular regulation that rules, the lack of coordination between the related institution, and the lack of employees in governmental institution and also the lack of budget provided by regional government up till now. Thus the government of Sleman Regency should improve the working system in related institution and unify the similar vision and mission, as well as the government should establish a strict regulation for managing and supervising <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> in Sleman Regency. For the surrounding society and the sand miners, they should have consideration and maintain the function of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area</b> in order to decrease environmental destruction of which is resulted by the mining activity in <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{national}} park protects {{part of the}} northern end of the Australian Alps with its spectacular granite mountains. Its habitat ranges from grassy plains over snow gum forests to alpine meadows. The fauna is also varied: eastern grey kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, magpies, rosellas and ravens are commonly seen. The <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>area</b> of the park supplies approximately 85% of Canberra's water.|$|E
25|$|Kersal is bounded on {{the north}} by Singleton Brook, which defines the border with Prestwich, on {{the south and west}} by the River Irwell and on the east by Broughton, {{although}} the exact position of the border with Broughton is difficult to determine. The west and south of the district lie in the flood-plain of the River Irwell, and consequently have historically been subject to flooding. Serious floods were documented in 1866, 1946, 1954 and 1980. The River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme, officially opened in 2005, uses levees and the playing fields alongside the river as an emergency <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>area</b> to alleviate this problem.|$|E
25|$|Tai Lam Country Park sits in {{the western}} New Territories with an area of 54km². Tai Lam has a small area of {{porphyry}} in the northeast; for the remaining area, it is composed of highly erodible decomposed granite. In 1952, afforestation started as a measure to protect the <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>area.</b> In spite of the poor soil conditions and the setbacks of fire damage over the years, mature stands of Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Pinus massoniana, Pinus elliottii and Eucalyptus species now cover most of the area. In addition, the plantations also offer a good habitat for birds, pangolins, Chinese leopard cat, and barking deer. Nevertheless, Tai Lam is an excellent place for outdoor activities because of its remoteness.|$|E

25|$|Work {{to build}} the Elan Valley {{reservoirs}} was undertaken because {{the rapid growth of}} the industrial city of Birmingham in the late 19th century had led to a lack of available clean water. Numerous outbreaks of disease prompted Birmingham City Council to petition the British government which passed the Birmingham Corporation Water Act in 1892. It allowed the Corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase all the land within the <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>area</b> of the Elan Valleys. Thousands of navvies and their families lived in the purpose-built Elan Village during the construction of the first four dams {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. In 1952, the Claerwen dam was opened by Elizabeth II in one of her first official engagements as monarch.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October 1992, the Board of Governors of the Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn {{determined}} {{the route of}} the new line. The spatial planning procedure was launched on 20October 1992. The Free State of Bavaria gave its opinion on the 1March 1993. It confirmed the compatibility of two options with the goals of land planning. The essential requirements were an ICE stop in Coburg, the replacement of embankments by bridges in ecologically sensitive areas, the relocation of the planned over-taking station in Dorfles-Esbach to the south and the lowest possible crossing of the Main valley to the north of Ebensfeld. An option, which involved a route through Coburg, was abandoned in this context. In its opinion of 20 April 1993, the State of Thuringia sought, among others, an Interregio stop in the Ilmenau area, a shift of the line in the Gehren / Gräfinau-Angstedt area to the west, a western bypass of Molsdorf to protect the drinking <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>area</b> of Erfurt and the bundling of the route with the A71 autobahn between Erfurt and Ilmenau. The planning approval procedure (as of mid-1994) would be carried out jointly in accordance with the railway law for both routes in this section.|$|E

Initially proposals were put forward by the Council of Southern Caving Clubs {{which is part of the}} British Caving Association was that SSSI designation, which would restrict what farmers and other landowners were allowed to do, would cover the entire catchment area. This was opposed as being too restrictive and difficult to enforce. It was argued that agricultural uses of fields which were not directly in contact with cave entrances would have little detrimental effect on the caves themselves. There was also debate about which caves and cave features should be considered [...] "important". The final settlement resulted in a smaller area being designated and [...] many agricultural practices being removed from the list of proscribed [...] "Potentially Damaging Operations".|$|E
