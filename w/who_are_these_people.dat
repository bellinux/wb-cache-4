2500|$|Some reviewers were unfavorable. One {{complaint}} {{was that the}} movie's pacing was too slow; while {{this may have been}} intended to convey a dream state, critics objected that it made actions and decisions seem labored. Another {{complaint was}} that since Kubrick shot the scenes set in New York City on a sound stage, the result was that they felt inauthentic. In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, [...] "Kubrick is annoyingly offhand {{while at the same time}} grindingly pedantic; plot points are made over and over again, things are explained till the dawn threatens to break in the east, and the movie stumbles along at a glacial pace." [...] David Edelstein of Slate dismissed it as [...] "estranged from any period I recognize. <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> played by Cruise and Kidman, who act as if no one has ever made a pass at them and are so deeply traumatized by their newfound knowledge of sexual fantasies--the kind that mainstream culture absorbed at least half a century ago? [...] Who are these aristocrats whose limos take them to secret masked orgies in Long Island mansions? Even dream plays need some grounding in the real world." [...] J. Hoberman wrote that the film [...] "feels like a rough draft at best." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{glance at}} the {{countryside}} conjures up a picture of extensive tracts being cultivated on a wholesale scale, of skilled men directing great ploughing, sowing, and reaping plants, steering cattle and sheep about carefully designed enclosures, constructing channels and guiding sewage towards its proper destination on the fields, and then of added crowds of genial people coming out to spray trees and plants, pick and sort and pack fruits. But <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people?</b> Why are they in particular doing this for the community? Is our Great State still to have a majority of people glad to do commonplace work for mediocre wages, and will there be other individuals who will ride by on the roads, sympathetically, no doubt, but with a secret sense of superiority? So one opens the general problem of the organisation for labour.|$|E

5000|$|When I was {{a student}} in Dublin we scoffed at the American celebration of St. Patrick, finding {{something}} preposterous in the green beer, the search for any connection, no matter how tenuous, to Ireland, the misty sentiment of it all that seemed so {{at odds with the}} Ireland we knew and actually lived in. <b>Who</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> dressed as Leprechauns and why were they dressed that way? This Hibernian Brigadoon was a sham, a mockery, a Shamrockery of real Ireland and a remarkable exhibition of plastic paddyness. But at least it was confined to the Irish abroad and those foreigners desperate to find some trace of green in their blood.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Los Angeles, California, Goelz had an {{interest}} in puppetry as a child, including an affinity for the children's television show Time for Beany, but after high school, he attended the Los Angeles Art Center College of Design and began work as an industrial designer. The mechanically-minded Goelz worked for such companies as John Deere, American Airlines, and Hewlett-Packard. However, when Sesame Street premiered, he was fascinated by the craftsmanship, as he recalled in an interview: [...] I had been a Muppet fan for many years, but now I started getting fascinated with the design process that went into what I was seeing on the screen. <b>Who</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> created the puppets, costumes and performances that were so evocative?

[...] In the Canon, most of them evidently own land, but they usually have labourers to do the {{physical}} work. [...] Sometimes they are also in business. [...] In fact, they illustrate how {{it is in the}} first instance wealth derived from agriculture which provides business capital. [...] The average gahapati who gave material support to the Buddha and his Sangha thus seems to have been something like a gentleman farmer, perhaps with a town house. [...] On the other hand, inscriptions in the western Deccan, where Buddhism flourished in the early centuries CE, use the term gahapati to refer to urban merchants. [...] We must distinguish between reference and meaning: the meaning of gahapati is simple and unvarying, but the reference shifts with the social context.|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} {{and processing}} of metal ores, {{particularly those of}} copper and tin, are regarded as among the principal motors of Bronze Age society. The skills and risks of mining lie behind the weapons, tools and symbols that drove political and ideological change.

Questionable gentlefolk plainly; the best French people never did such things. Euphemia would return straightway to her convent, shut herself up and await her own arrival. It took Mrs. Cleve three weeks to travel from Nice to Paris, and during this time the young girl had no communication with her lover beyond accepting a bouquet of violets marked with his initials and left by a female friend.

50|$|Dylan is {{the only}} boy living in the tiny Welsh town of Manod. His parents run the Snowdonia Oasis Auto Marvel garage—and when he's not trying to persuade his sisters to play football, Dylan {{is in charge of}} the petrol log. And, that means he gets to keep track of {{everyone}} coming in and out of Manod- what car they drive, what they're called, even their favourite flavour of crisps. But when a mysterious convoy of lorries trundles up the misty mountainside towards an old, disused mine, even Dylan is confounded. <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> and what have they got to hide? This is a story inspired by a press cutting describing how, during World War II, the treasured contents of London's National Gallery were stored in Welsh slate mines. Once a month, a morale-boosting masterpiece would be unveiled in the village and then returned to London for viewing. This is a funny and touching exploration of how art — its beauty and its value — touches the life of one little boy and his big family in a very small town.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Acton sat gazing; {{this was}} part of Madame Munster's [...] "manner." [...] But Robert Acton was gazing too, in vivid {{consciousness}} that he had barely mentioned his mother to their brilliant guest. He never talked of this still maternal presence,--a presence refined to such delicacy that it had almost resolved itself, with him, simply into the subjective emotion of gratitude. And Acton rarely talked of his emotions. The Baroness turned her smile toward him, and she instantly felt that she had been observed to be fibbing. She had struck a false note. But <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> to whom such fibbing was not pleasing? If they were annoyed, the Baroness was equally so; and after the exchange of a few civil inquiries and low-voiced responses she took leave of Mrs. Acton. She begged Robert not to come home with her; she would get into the carriage alone; she preferred that. This was imperious, and she thought he looked disappointed. While she stood before the door with him--the carriage was turning in the gravel-walk--this thought restored her serenity.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden was {{a little}} hurt--a good deal mystified. It was a very odd thing. He {{was not in the}} least a snob, but he knew that the visit of the Countess of Deringham, whose name was still great in the social world, was not a thing to be refused without grave reasons by a girl in the {{position}} of Mr. Sabin's niece. The old question came back to him with an irresistible emphasis. <b>Who</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> <b>people?</b> He looked at her furtively. He was an observant man in the small details of a woman's toilette, and he knew that he had never met a girl better turned out than his present companion. The cut of her tailor-made gown was perfection, her gloves and boots could scarcely have come from anywhere but Paris. She carried herself too with a perfect ease and indefinable distinction which could only have come to her by descent. She was a perfect type of the woman of breeding--unrestrained, yet aristocratic to the tips of her finger-nails.|$|R

5000|$|During the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, Fisk {{was stationed in}} Baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports. He has criticised other journalists based in Iraq {{for what he calls}} their [...] "hotel journalism", literally reporting from one's hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events. His opposition to the war brought criticism from both Irish Sunday Independent columnist and senator, Eoghan Harris, and The Guardian columnist, Simon Hoggart. Fisk has criticised the Coalition's handling of the sectarian violence in post-invasion Iraq, and argued that the official narrative of sectarian conflict is not possible: [...] "The real question I ask myself is: <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> who are trying to provoke the civil war? Now the Americans will say it's Al Qaeda, it's the Sunni insurgents. It is the death squads. Many of the death squads work for the Ministry of Interior. Who runs the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad?

The great Victorian novelist invented these richly-drawn characters to fit into the novels he wrote. He was a storyteller, first and foremost, someone who wrote episodic narratives driven by the unstoppable force of his ingeniously-crafted plots. He populated his books with amazing characters, of course, but tearing them away from their stories is to essentially denude them of their essential life and being". He compared the opening episodes to [...] "a weird Doctor Who episode where the Doctor enters some kind of weird alien dream world populated by characters formed from half-remembered dreams of his reading of English Victorian literature". Conceding that [...] "Jordan has also rather cleverly managed to fashion a whodunit plot out of the death of Marley”, Dowell decided, “if I am honest I am not sure I will be hanging around to find out more. This is fast-paced, well written soapy drama. But its also, for me, a messy pudding that is - but really isnt - Dickens".|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} 15 years my {{practice}} as a textile conservator and artist has stimulated an ongoing dialog between myself as a textile maker and the weavers of ancient textiles. A human hair caught in the web of a cloth, a weaver’s choice of interlacement patterns and the deliberate manipulation of woven motifs all mark the presence of “the weaver. ” <b>Who</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> why do their creations make us marvel and how can our experience as contemporary weavers add to the scholarship of ancient textiles? Because of the structural simplicity of tapestry weave, analyzing an intricate design from a culture {{such as that of}} Pre-Columbian Peru allows us to {{come face to face with}} an individual weaver’s decision making processes concerning technique and design. In tapestry, the weaver is essentially “drawing” with thread, an individualized act that reflects personal and cultural sensibilities and enhances the immediacy of the medium through time. Through slides gleaned from research and my conservation practice, highlighting the recent conservation of a pictorial Wari tunic, I will elaborate on the following theme: The tapestry medium offers considerable freedom to the creator. Viewed through a continuum of several centuries, the decision-making processes of the weaver, evidenced in such practices as lazy lines, dovetailing, and slits, gives us clues to what <b>these</b> <b>people</b> valued and thought, and offers insights for contemporary tapestry artists and textile scholars...|$|R

His face was tickled, his ears whistled into. Girls cried: 'Keep your hair on, stucco!' A youth so knocked off his top-hat that he recovered it with difficulty. Crackers were exploding beneath his nose, between his feet. He was bewildered, exasperated, offended. This stream of people came from every quarter, as if impulse had unlocked flood-gates, let flow waters of whose existence he had heard, perhaps, but believed in never. This, then, was the populace, the innumerable living negation of gentility and Forsyteism. This was--egad!--Democracy! It stank, yelled, was hideous! In the East End, or even Soho, perhaps--but here in Regent Street, in Piccadilly! What were the police about!
