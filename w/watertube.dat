50|$|Named {{after its}} designers, the then Poplar-based Yarrow Shipbuilders, {{this type of}} three-drum boiler has three drums in a delta {{formation}} connected by <b>watertubes.</b> The drums are linked by straight <b>watertubes,</b> allowing easy tube-cleaning. This does, however, mean that the tubes enter the drums at varying angles, a more difficult joint to caulk. Outside the firebox, a pair of 'cold-leg' pipes between each drum act as 'downcomers'.|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler could thus {{dispense}} with separate external downcomers. Flow was entirely within the heated <b>watertubes,</b> upwards within {{those closest to}} the furnace and downwards through those in the outer rows of the bank.|$|R
5000|$|The 'Low Water Content' boiler has a {{lower and}} upper header {{connected}} by <b>watertubes</b> that are directly impinged upon from the burner. This is a [...] "furnace-less" [...] boiler that can generate steam and react quickly to changes in load.|$|R
500|$|In March 1898, {{shortly before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War, the US Navy attempted to purchase Capitán Prat to bolster its fleet for the coming conflict with Spain. The negotiations fell through, however, and the ship remained in Chile. By 1903, in the prelude to the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government looked into purchasing Capitán Prat and the cruiser Esmeralda, along with other South American warships. Esmeralda was eventually purchased and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Izumi. By 1907, the ship was seen as outmoded in comparison to newer armored cruisers in the fleet. In 1909–1910, the ship was modernized, which included the installation of twelve new Babcock & Wilcox <b>watertube</b> boilers in place of the old cylindrical boilers, increasing the ship's top speed to [...] The height of her funnels was also increased.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1954 Baldwin built a [...] steam turbine-electric {{locomotive}} for {{freight service}} on the Norfolk and Western Railway (N), nicknamed the [...] "Jawn Henry" [...] after the legend of John Henry, a steel-driver on a track crew who famously raced against a steam drill and won, only to die immediately afterwards. The unit was similar in appearance to the C turbines but very different mechanically; it had a C+C-C+C wheel arrangement, and an improved <b>watertube</b> boiler which was fitted with automatic controls. Unfortunately the boiler controls were sometimes problematic, and (as with the C turbines) coal dust and water got into the motors. [...] "Jawn Henry" [...] was retired from the N roster on January 4, 1958.|$|E
5000|$|The Stirling boiler has near-vertical, almost-straight <b>watertubes</b> that zig-zag {{between a}} number of steam and water drums. Usually there are three banks of tubes in a [...] "four drum" [...] layout, but certain {{applications}} use variations designed with a different number of drums and banks.|$|R
50|$|The {{design by}} Robertson of Fleetwood, Lancashire, was {{originally}} used in steam wagons. It was {{often used in}} similar situations to the Sentinel boiler, but has fire-tubes rather than <b>watertubes.</b> It is best known from its popularity in model engineering, as a multi-tube boiler that's relatively easy to construct.|$|R
25|$|Yarrow's {{production}} boiler had {{a simple}} and distinctive design that remained broadly unchanged afterwards.

They were linked by straight <b>watertubes</b> in a multi-row bank to each water drum.|$|R
2500|$|The {{power plant}} was two three-drum <b>watertube</b> boilers and two geared turbines, each driving one shaft. It was {{arranged}} on a unit basis, with alternate boiler and engine rooms in pairs, {{so that a}} single hit could not disable both boilers or both turbines. Each boiler had a nominal capacity of 20-tons/hour of superheated steam at a pressure of 21 atmospheres and a temperature of [...] Each turbine set consisted of one high-speed turbine and a low-speed turbine. The latter had an astern turbine housed in its casing, all driving the same shaft. The total power {{was designed to be}} , but this figure wasn't reached in practice.

50|$|Designed by the American firm of Babcock & Wilcox, {{this type}} {{has a single}} drum, with {{feedwater}} drawn {{from the bottom of}} the drum into a header that supplies inclined water-tubes.

25|$|The {{weight of}} the boiler rested on the water drums, and thus on {{supports}} from the firing flat's deck. The steam drum was only supported by the <b>watertubes</b> and was allowed to move freely, with thermal expansion. If superheated, the superheater elements were hung from this drum. Compared to the earlier Scotch and locomotive boilers, water-tube boilers with their reduced water volumes were considered lightweight and didn't require extensive supports.|$|R

5000|$|Owing {{to their}} superb working properties, {{the use of}} <b>watertube</b> boilers is highly {{preferred}} in the following major areas: ...|$|E
50|$|Designed by the {{shipbuilder}} John I. Thornycroft & Company, the Thornycroft type {{features a}} single steam drum with {{two sets of}} <b>watertubes</b> {{either side of the}} furnace. These tubes, especially the central set, have sharp curves. Apart from obvious difficulties in cleaning them, this may also give rise to bending forces as the tubes warm up, tending to pull them loose from the tubeplate and creating a leak. There are two furnaces, venting into a common exhaust, giving the boiler a wide base tapering profile.|$|R
50|$|The boiler was Straker's own {{development}} of the original De Dion. It was a vertical water-tube boiler, constructed from four concentric tubes. The inner and outer pairs of tubes were joined to form two double-walled water jackets. Between these jackets ran numerous short, straight <b>watertubes,</b> sloping up slightly towards the centre. The central waterspace was higher than the outer space, acting as a steam dome. This also made the boiler's water level less sensitive to tilting when hill climbing, a great concern for many wagon makes. The boiler was fired by dropping fuel, usually gasworks coke, down a central firing chute. For cleaning every few months, the outer shell could be removed entirely.|$|R

5000|$|... “The {{ability of}} <b>watertube</b> boilers to {{generate}} superheated steam makes these boilers particularly attractive in applications that require dry, high-pressure, high-energy steam, including steam turbine power generation”.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, Alley & McLellan {{launched}} the first Sentinel wagon, {{driven by a}} well designed, rugged engine with poppet valves, and an effective superheated vertical cross <b>watertube</b> boiler. It was a revolutionary design, and immediately took {{a large share of}} the market.|$|E
50|$|Their {{ability to}} work at higher {{pressures}} has led to marine boilers being almost entirely water-tube. This change began around 1900, and traced the adoption of turbines for propulsion rather than reciprocating (i.e. piston) engines - although <b>watertube</b> boilers were also used with reciprocating engines.|$|E
5000|$|The PLM also {{experimented with}} a {{high-pressure}} <b>watertube</b> boiler on the unique PLM 241B1 prototype, constructed with a German Schmidt-Henschel boiler in 1930. It was soon learned, however, that this locomotive {{was a failure}} and it was retired and broken up by the mid-1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Besides, {{they are}} {{frequently}} employed {{in power generation}} plants where large quantities of steam (ranging up to 500 kg/s) having high pressures i.e. approximately [...] and high temperatures reaching up to 550 °C are generally required. For example, the Ivanpah solar-power station uses two Rentech Type-D <b>watertube</b> boilers.|$|E
50|$|The Aquatic Center is an Indoor Waterpark zone in Caribbean Bay. It {{has several}} pools {{including}} a Wave Pool and Diving Pool. It also has 3 <b>watertube</b> Slides.

On trials Lord Clive made 8.02 kn. She carried 356 LT of coal which gave her a range of 1100 nmi km at 6.5 kn.|$|E
50|$|The boiler is a <b>watertube</b> boiler, {{with these}} tubes {{contained}} within a vertical, cylindrical outer drum. This drum is double-walled and forms a water jacket around the boiler, {{with a large}} vertical flue within. The inner flue has a complex cross section. It is stepped in three diameters, tapering towards the top. The central region is square in section, rather than round.|$|E
5000|$|Glatton {{displaced}} 5746 LT at deep load as built, with {{a length}} of 310 ft, a beam of 73 ft at maximum, although her main hull only had a beam of 55 ft and a draught of 16 ft. She was powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines, which developed a total of [...] from four Yarrow <b>watertube</b> boilers and gave a maximum speed of 12 kn.|$|E
50|$|A <b>watertube</b> boiler (also spelled {{water-tube}} {{and water}} tube) {{is a type}} of boiler in which water circulates in tubes heated externally by the fire. Fuel is burned inside the furnace, creating hot gas which heats water in the steam-generating tubes. In smaller boilers, additional generating tubes are separate in the furnace, while larger utility boilers rely on the water-filled tubes that make up the walls of the furnace to generate steam.|$|E
5000|$|The older fire-tube boiler design, {{in which}} the water {{surrounds}} the heat source and gases from combustion pass through tubes within the water space, is a much weaker structure and is rarely used for pressures above [...] A significant advantage of the <b>watertube</b> boiler {{is that there is}} less chance of a catastrophic failure: there is not a large volume of water in the boiler nor are there large mechanical elements subject to failure.|$|E
