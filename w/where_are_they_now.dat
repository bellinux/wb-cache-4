25|$|Controversy {{occurred}} when Barry suddenly departed {{the group with}} no public explanation on the program. Rumours in magazines and newspapers suggested she had been caught stealing items from other members. Six years later in 2006, Barry appeared on the program <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>They</b> <b>Now?,</b> {{to speak for the}} first time over the incident. She stated that she accidentally kept Monk's weekly money allowance with the intention of giving it back to her, but forgot to do this and was therefore removed from the group. In a 2017 Woman's Day interview, Barry stated that she was paid $1000 to leave and keep quiet on the matter, and blamed her actions on her youth and naivety.|$|E

500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>now?</b> They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

60|$|The constable made {{no reply}} but moved off. Soon {{he reached the}} corner of the Terrace and disappeared.

Big Ben struck one o'clock, several people passed backwards and forwards. Men were coming out from the club, and separating for the night; the roar of the city was growing fainter. Yet Tavernake felt indisposed to move. The look in that man's drawn white face and black eyes haunted him, There was tragedy there, the shadow of terrible things, fear, and the murderous desire to kill! Through that door they had passed, the two men, one in flight, the other in pursuit. <b>Where</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>now?</b> Perhaps it had been a trap.

The space of time, passed in the world before they again met, would be an age of sensation, passion, experience to all of them.
