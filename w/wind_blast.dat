25|$|The Ninja 300 {{is based}} on the Ninja 250R, a {{lightweight}} and inexpensive sport bike in production for over three decades. Like the Ninja 250R, it has a full fairing, but a wider rear tire, 140/70, than the instead of 130/70 on the 250R. The Ninja 300 also has a LED tail lamp, 5 spoke wheels, neutral finder, and optional ABS.By comparison with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases clutch lever effort. Despite being a sport bike, it has comfortable ergonomics (such as windscreen effectively protecting from <b>wind</b> <b>blast)</b> which promotes commuting.|$|E

A <b>wind</b> <b>blast</b> nearly blows them both off the tower, but they are saved by the combined efforts of Conan, Jigen and Sonoko. Chastised, Baretti confesses that Carnevale, who is affiliated with the Italian Mafia, uses his concerts as a cover to conduct illegal dealings, and therefore Baretti made up the threat to his life in order to have the Japan concert, an anacrusis for yet another deal, called off.|$|E
5000|$|The {{airport was}} {{extensively}} damaged during Cyclone Hudhud in October 2014, with <b>winds</b> <b>blasting</b> at speeds of 185 km/h; the runway was inundated and navigational aids destroyed, the terminal building roof also suffered substantial damage. The airport {{was shut down}} for commercial operations on 11 October as a precautionary measure; and naval- and other flights carrying relief materials were the only aircraft operating from the airport. The airport re-commenced partial operations from 17 October after electrical power was restored. AAI restored the airport to full operations within the span of three months.|$|R

500|$|The {{first two}} hurricanes {{to strike the}} Gulf Coast—in August and September, respectively—caused {{significant}} inundation of low-lying and coastal communities, inflicting severe damage and killing dozens of people.

Sugar cane crops were destroyed by these two systems as well as the succeeding storm in early October. Property and infrastructure suffered with all three events. With the third storm that made landfall, extreme <b>winds</b> <b>blasted</b> the city of New Orleans and surrounding areas. All other storms remained away from land with no effects except on shipping.|$|R
50|$|Steele {{was born}} Jack Ellwood Steele in Lacon, Illinois. He {{attended}} Mendota Township High School (Mendota, Ill), {{then went on}} to study general engineering at the University of Illinois and the Illinois Institute of Technology. He served in the US Army from 1943 to 1946, who put him through pre-med at University of Minnesota in 1944. He received his M.D. from Northwestern University in 1950. He spent a year there as Research and Teaching Fellow in Neuro-anatomy before joining the US Air Force in 1951 where he served until retirement in 1971. He initially served as Ward Officer of Psychiatry and Neurology until he joined 6570th Aerospace Medical Research Lab in 1953. There he investigated stress effects of motions, sound and <b>wind</b> <b>blast,</b> but his main focus was on bionics, a term he coined in 1958. The term was officially used in 1960 as the title of a three-day symposium in September of that year.|$|E
5000|$|Jeff Karr, in Motorcyclist magazine, {{agreed with}} Walters that perhaps 250 mph was conceivable, {{according}} to rough calculations suggesting that motorcycles with far less drag, like the Suzuki Hayabusa and Kawasaki ZX-12R would need {{on the order}} of 460 hp to reach only 300 mph, and so the Tomahawk, with at least 50% more drag than those bikes, would have to have at least 700 hp to attain even 300 mph, given that drag increases as the square of speed. Without protection from <b>wind</b> <b>blast</b> and a secure riding position, however, approaching a speed like 250 mph, or even 200 mph, would be unsafe due to the instability of the design and the lack of any provision to prevent aerodynamic lift from pulling the rider off the seat. Dave Campos, motorcycle land speed record rider, doubted the Tomahawk could reach 200 mph because at high speeds, the rider would be [...] "lifted right off the bike" [...] without a fairing, and the four-wheel steering could also be a problem.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first of}} the seven {{remaining}} Hau Dragon robots Zeorymer faces is the air-based robot known as Lanstar of the Winds, piloted by Taiha, the lover of Hau Dragon ruler Yuratei. Lanstar is smaller in build but slimmer than Zeorymer, denoting less overall protection but seeming to exhibit greater speed and agility, though {{they appear to be}} the same height. Lanstar of the Winds has a pair of huge mechanical wings on its back which seem to be the source of its powers, which are focused around creating and controlling intense air currents. To this end it can generate, at will, [...] "sharp" [...] planes of wind, tornadoes, or even release its signature Dead Long Fuun attack wherein Lanstar projects four streams of incredibly intense air currents that combine into the shape of a serpentine dragon. This intense <b>wind</b> <b>blast</b> creates a vortex of wind so powerful when it strikes a target that it was easily capable of stripping stone and earth from the ground and even causing some damage to Zeorymer's armor.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{material}} damage caused by a nuclear air burst {{is caused by a}} combination of the high static overpressures and the <b>blast</b> <b>winds.</b> The long compression of the blast wave weakens structures, which are then torn apart by the <b>blast</b> <b>winds.</b> The compression, vacuum and drag phases together may last several seconds or longer, and exert forces many times greater than the strongest hurricane.|$|R
5000|$|In Springfield, the {{temperature}} difference {{was even more}} extreme. Springfield was at [...] at about 3:45 PM, before the cold front moved through. Fifteen minutes later, {{the temperature}} was at 40 °F (4 °C) with <b>winds</b> <b>blasting</b> out of the northwest at 40 mph. By 7:00 P.M. Central Standard Time (01:00 UTC 12 November) the temperature had dropped a further 20 °F (3.9 °C), and by midnight, a record low of 13 °F (&minus;11 °C) was established. It {{was the first time}} since records had been kept for Springfield when the record high and record low were broken in the same day. The freak temperature difference was also a record breaker: 67 °F (37 °C) in 10 hours.|$|R
