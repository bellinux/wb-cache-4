God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom.

40|$|Edgar Collins {{had been}} {{interested}} in art since his MIT days. When {{he dropped out of}} graduate school in 1988, he never imagined that he would become a wealthy collector of fine art. After amassing billions in an Indochinese, then Chinese, telecom venture with a fellow MIT dropout, he decided to “give something back. ” Edgar found a convenient mechanism for his philanthropy: donating artwork to public museums all over the world. He had traveled extensively with his wife Libby and collected major and lesser-known works. He also developed a keen interest in finding undiscovered artwork. For instance, in 1992 he discovered a new van Gogh that a Japanese businessman had kept private in his family estate for over 50 years. As his dinner guests arrived on Friday evening, Edgar’s eyes were flashing. The guests were buzzing with speculation on what piece Edgar had found this time. Edgar’s closest friend, Dmitri, made his way across the room. “You’ve done it again, haven’t you! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> this time, another Van Gogh? ” chided Dmitri. “Dmitri, there are paintings out there that need to be seen. ” “Edgar, I think you’ve already tracked down all the credible leads.

40|$|Problem: What {{practice}} problem did {{you address}} {{and why is}} change needed? New nurses hired into critical care units had difficulty performing at the expected level despite a standards-based critical care orientation. Retention and quality patient outcomes suffered as a result. The change needed was to improve clinical quality outcomes and retention. Evidence: What evidence did you use {{to address the problem}} and how was it gathered and appraised? A literature search led to the adoption of Benner’s Novice to Expert competency levels and the American Association of Critical Care Nurses ’ Synergy model. The needs of novice nurses were correlated with tools to implement orientation processes as developed in the Synergy Model. Strategy: What strategy was used to link the innovation to the evidence? Following Benner’s theory and the Synergy model as a basis for decision-making, the partnerships formed with the stakeholders had power and resulted in the commitment to share in the accountability measures and ultimate outcomes of the new nurse in critical care. Orientation was structured differently to ensure adherence to the new strategy. Practice Change: What specific practice change was made (for quality improvement studies) or procedure evaluated (for research studies) ? The orientation now consists of twelve weeks divided into 6 phases associated with Benner’s levels of competency with clearly written objectives to guide the stakeholders ’ evaluation of the new nurse’s technical, critical thinking, and interpersonal communication skills while balancing the number and needs of patients to the skill level of the orientee. Evaluation: What outcomes were measured and how? Outcomes were measured through satisfaction surveys of the stakeholders and PressGaney score. Patient outcomes were assessed through performance improvement indicators. Graduate RN retention rates were monitored at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year.

40|$|In the {{undergraduate}} engineering program at Griffith University in Australia, the unit 1006 ENG Design and Professional Skills aims {{to provide an}} introduction to engineering design and professional practice through a project-based learning (PBL) approach to problem solving. It provides students with an experience of PBL in the first-year of their programme. The unit comprises an underpinning lecture series, design work including group project activities, an individual computer-aided drawing exercise/s and an oral presentation. Griffith University employs a ‘Student Experience of Course’ (SEC) online survey {{as part of its}} student evaluation of teaching, quality improvement and staff performance management processes. As well as numerical response scale items, it includes the following two questions inviting open-ended text responses from students: i) <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> particularly good about this course? and ii) How could this course be improved? The collection of textual data in in student surveys is commonplace, due to the rich descriptions of respondent experiences they can provide at relatively low cost. However, historically these data have been underutilised because they are time consuming to analyse manually, {{and there has been a}} lack of automated tools to exploit such data efficiently. Text analytics approaches offer analysis methods that result in visual representations of comment data that highlight key individual themes in these data and the relationships between those themes. We present a text analytics-based evaluation of the SEC open-ended comments received in the first two years of offer of the PBL unit 1006 ENG. We discuss the results obtained in detail. The method developed and documented here is a practical and useful approach to analysing/visualising open-ended comment data that could be applied by others with similar comment data sets...|$|E
40|$|Writing a good {{abstract}} is {{a sophisticated}} skill. An abstract is a stand-alone statement that briefly conveys the essential information of a paper, article, document or book; presents the objective, methods, results, and conclusions {{of a research}} project; has a brief, non-repetitive style. What purpose does an abstract serve? It forms the first "content " page of your paper/dissertation/thesis and is therefore {{the first thing to}} be read by the assessor and forms the first impression of your work. It may also share {{one or more of the}} following: Allow a reader to decide whether or not to read the full text. Include keywords essential to your topic which may be searched for in an electronic database With the addition of just a title and your name, be suitable for inclusion in a printed or electronic index where it would identify the potential value of your research to another, or stand as a summary you might submit as a proposal to a conference. How long? 200 words will be adequate provided you write concisely and are summarising, not re-writing, the contents of your report. Electronic databases automatically truncate abstracts beyond a certain length so keywords associated with your results, conclusions or recommendations may be omitted. Although an abstract appears as the first section of a paper, it should be written last. You need to have completed all other sections before you can select and summarize the essential information from those sections. An abstract should include: Purpose: Why did you undertake the study? What were you examining, or testing or investigating. A good opening is often, "The study tested [...] . ", "The book investigated [...] . ", "The article examines [...] . ". Methodology: What was done and how did you do it? Be specific, don’t make generalised comments. Results and conclusions: <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find?</b> State specific outcomes and, if appropriate, draw conclusions. References An abstract should not normally contain references. Many abstracts are published without the complete paper itself in abstract journals or in online databases. Thus, an abstract might serve as the only means by which a researcher determines what information a paper contains. An abstract must convey the essential results of a paper...|$|E
