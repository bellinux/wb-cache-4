Including some early Tuesday previews, it earned $36.6 million in one-and-a-half days, and by Thursday its {{overseas}} total reached $66 million. By {{the end of its}} first weekend, it had earned $219.8 million, which stands as the fifth-largest opening weekend of all time overseas and the largest for Paramount. Its foreign launch was 57% ahead of that of Revenge of the Fallen ($139.6 million). 70% of its grosses came from 3-D (a higher 3-D share than Pirates 4s 66%). Don Harris, general manager of distribution for Paramount, commented on the results of Dark of the Moon: [...] "If we hadn't chosen to debut the movie later in Japan and China, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have had the all-time record." [...] The film topped the box office outside North America for two weekends in a row.|$|E

[...] He was also quoted as saying, [...] "Had we from Yugoslavia done something like this, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been bombed."

2500|$|Favreau led {{a speech}} writing {{team for the}} {{campaign}} which included Ben Rhodes and Cody Keenan. For his work with Obama in the campaign, he would wake as early as 5a.m., and routinely stayed up until 3 a.m. working on speeches. [...] His leadership style among the other Obama speechwriters was very informal. They would often meet in a small conference room, discussing their work late into the evening over take-out food. According to Rhodes, Favreau did not drive structured meetings with agendas. [...] "If he had, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have laughed at him," [...] Rhodes said. Favreau was planning to hire more speechwriters to assist him, but conceded he was unsure of how to manage them. According to him, [...] "My biggest strength isn't the organization thing." ...|$|E

Steve Pond of Reuters theorised that <b>W.E.</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not help in [...] "turning Madonna's faltering movie career". Kyle Buchanan of New York wondered whether W.E. would receive any significant film related awards, as predicted by industry prognosticators. He concluded that the film [...] "still may , but to judge {{from some of the}} vicious pans coming out of Venice today, it might have longer legs as a Razzie front-runner." [...] Daily Mails Baz Bamigboye gave the film a mostly positive review, saying that [...] "A lot of people will loathe it, simply because it’s been made by Madonna. But if people were to watch it with no knowledge of who directed, they would be pleasantly surprised. They might even find much of it enjoyable." [...] David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph gave the film three stars and a mixed review stating that, [...] "Madonna's W.E. is a bold and confident story about an American woman's obsession with the Windsors." [...] Gritten complimented Riseborough and Cornish's acting but felt that the film looked like a commercial of expensive items, thus making it appeal to younger women for its fashion portrayal.|$|E

They had reasons for not wanting to fall into the Russians' hands. Well, we cleared the beach, and once or twice, as I tried to bale, there was a shout somewhere near us, and the loom of a {{vanishing}} boat. It was all we could make out, for the sea was slopping into the boat, and the spray was flying everywhere. If there had been only two boats <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have found out our misfortune, and perhaps would have set it straight. As it was, we couldn't tell that it was the same boat that had hailed us." ...|$|E

At the 1951 census, Alberta's population had grown to 940,000 while Saskatchewan remained stagnant. The 1951 census also made note of the transformation the province was undergoing, as the urban population outnumbered the rural {{for the first time}} in the province's history.

5000|$|Netscape was {{the first}} company to attempt to {{capitalize}} on the nascent World Wide Web. It was founded under the name Mosaic Communications Corporation on April 4, 1994, the brainchild of Jim Clark who had recruited Marc Andreessen as co-founder and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as investors. The first meeting between Clark and Andreessen was never truly about a software or service like Netscape, but more about a product that was similar to Nintendo. Clark recruited other early team members from SGI and NCSA Mosaic. Jim Barksdale came on board as CEO in January 1995. Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen originally created a 20-page concept pitch for an online gaming network to Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 console, but a deal was never reached. Marc Andreessen explains, [...] "If they had shipped a year earlier, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have done that instead of Netscape." ...|$|E
50|$|Thorsness {{described}} the incident:It appeared the MiG was {{going after the}} chutes so I took off after him. I was a little high, dropped down to about 1000 feet, and headed north after him. We were doing about 550 knots and really catching up fast. At about 3000 feet (range) I fired a burst but missed. I lined him up again and was closing very fast. I was a bit below him now. At 700 feet or so I pull my trigger and pulled the pipper through him. Parts of his left started coming off. Suddenly I realized that Harry Johnson was frantically {{trying to get my}} attention. There were a couple of MiGs on our tail! If I had hit that MiG dead on, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have swallowed some of his debris. But we got him! I lit the burner, dropped down as low as possible, and ducked into the hills west of Hanoi. The MiGs could not keep up with us.|$|E

You see, there is not one of all the little people in the Green Forest who has so many enemies to watch out for as has Whitefoot. There are ever so many who would like nothing better than to dine on plump little Whitefoot. There are Buster Bear and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and Unc' Billy Possum and Hooty the Owl and all the members of the Hawk family, not to mention Blacky the Crow in times when other food is scarce. Reddy and Granny Fox and Old Man Coyote are always looking for him.|$|R

Stylistically the Latin of the Anonymous Life is not as grammatical and classicizing as Bede's Prose Life, and Bede went to some effort to 'improve' the prose.|$|R
