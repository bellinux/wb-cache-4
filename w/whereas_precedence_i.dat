40|$|Abstract—With today’s {{petascale}} supercomputers, applications often exhibit low efficiency, such as poor {{communication and}} I/O performance, {{that can be}} diagnosed by analysis tools. However, these tools either produce extremely large trace files that complicate performance analysis, or sacrifice accuracy to collect high-level statistical information using crude averaging. This work contributes Scala-H-Trace, which features more aggressive trace compression than any previous approach, particularly for applications that do not show strict regularity in SPMD behavior. Scala-H-Trace uses histograms expressing the probabilistic distribution of arbitrary communication and I/O parameters to capture variations. Yet, where other tools fail to scale, Scala-H-Trace guarantees trace files of near constant size, even for variable communication and I/O patterns, producing trace files orders of magnitudes smaller than using prior approaches. We demonstrate the ability to collect traces of applications running on thousands of processors {{with the potential to}} scale well beyond this level. We further present the first approach to deterministically replay such probabilistic traces (a) without deadlocks and (b) in a manner closely resembling the original applications. Our results show either near constant sized traces or only sub-linear increases in trace file sizes irrespective of the number of nodes utilized. Even with the aggressively compressed histogram-based traces, our replay times are within 12 % to 15 % of the runtime of original codes. Such concise traces resembling the behavior of production-style codes closely and our approach of deterministic replay of probabilistic traces are without <b>precedence.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R

This expressive trajectory i. e. exercising masculinity via Islamism holds true in Pakistan and can be broadly attributed to three elements. First, Pakistan’s postcolonial baggage – a well-documented history of rise of Muslim nationalism, and Islamism in the subcontinent; second, western domination and interference in Pakistan’s socio-economic and political domains (as in competition with Islamic heritage and governance frameworks) affecting some segments (and not all) among Muslim youth; and third, decades of authoritarian rule taking turns with weak democratic governments who have largely disappointed in terms of alleviating absolute to relative poverty, marginalization and alienation troubling Pakistani society. Pakistan’s history and contemporary settings both reveal a dissonance between the prescribed, normative and idealized Muslim masculinity imperatives – and the socio-economic and political location of Pakistani men in the real world. Mostly leading dangerous, disenfranchised, and economically deprived lives {{it is difficult for}} them to uphold, for example, Quran’s masculine imperative of being a qawwam or an ethnic normative of honor.

In this paper, we propose a photonic buffer architecture that can support prioritized buffer management schemes with less complexity, so that the capability for ultra-high-speed packet forwarding can be sustained in the photonic packet switch. We propose the vPBSO (Variable-length-packet-capable Partial Buffer Sharing with Overwriting) method, which is a prioritized buffer management scheme for providing DiffServ (Differentiated Services) Assured Forwarding. It can handle asynchronously arriving variable-length packets. vPBSO {{is based on a}} single queue, and its complexity is O(p), where p is the number of levels of drop <b>precedence</b> (<b>i.</b> e., the number of priority classes). We show that at lower arrival rates, vPBSO provides better performance than vPBS (our extension to the existing method, called PBS, which is a prioritized buffer management method for synchronously arriving fixed-length packets) for high-priority packets, and the performance for low-priority packets is also better or at least almost the same. It is also shown that once the appropriate control parameter values for vPBSO and vPBS are determined and appropriate buffer management scheme is selected depending on the arrival rate of packets, we can achieve high-performance prioritized buffer management, which can be realized by some traffic load estimation method. vPBSO is especially effective when the arrival rate of higher priority packets is lower than that of lower priority packets, which is a likely situation in the [...] ...|$|R

This fund got a large publicity when it was proved that it had outperformed any other fund by 87 percent during a ten year period. Though, {{it was not until}} the early 1990 ’s hedge funds became popular for the general public. The goal for hedge funds in general is to yield an absolute return and there are many different strategies for reaching this goal. This has lead to the following three research questions: Have Hedge funds been able to reach its goal for an absolute return in both bullish and bearish times? Which strategy has shown the best performance in markets on the rise and in declining markets and is it possible to place the different strategies in order of <b>precedence?</b> <b>Is</b> it possible to come up with a guideline for investing in hedge funds on the Swedish market? Purpose: The purpose with this thesis is to study the returns on a large number of hedge funds in the American fund market based upon their investment strategy, both when the market is gaining and when it is declining. Method: In this thesis we have investigated twelve different strategies in the American market. By using secondary data from HFRI’s hedge fund database we have conducted a quantitative research by calculating key statistics for the strategies. We have also plotted performance diagrams were the strategies are compared with S&P 500. To be able to answer our research questions we constructed a table containing a summary of the risk and return for the strategies in bullish and bearish market times. Results: Our research showed that there were two strategies that were capable of delivering an absolute return for the entire period. However, when looking deeper into the yearly returns we found that there were another eight strategies that presented a negative return for just one out of the total eleven years. To conclude the research we have placed the strategies in order of precedence that works as a guideline for investing in the Swedish market in bull and bear markets...|$|R
