40|$|This study {{focuses on}} a {{mesoscale}} eddy feature, the 2 ̆ 7 Capricorn Eddy 2 ̆ 7, that typically forms <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>indentation</b> of the continental shelf in the southern GBR system. Satellite data at moderate resolution (1 km) are used to examine relevant mesoscale and sub-mesoscale sea surface dynamics. Available in situ measurements and model data are used to validate the satellite observations and to specify {{the nature of the}} processes occurring within the water column itself. The characteristic features are identified and physical theory employed to develop an understanding of associated processes. In particular, the effect of the eddy in raising cooler, nutrient-enriched oceanic subsurface water and transporting it to the reef zone, and eventually into the lagoon, is shown. This study demonstrates that the linkages between large-scale oceanography and the meso- and sub-mesoscale patterns are crucial to determining biologic responses on the scale of reef communities and may be key to understanding climate change impacts at the relevant spatial scales. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|E

40|$|Elastic modulus of an yttria {{partially}} stabilized zirconia (YSZ) {{thermal barrier}} coating (TBC) was evaluated with <b>a</b> Knoop <b>indentation</b> technique. The measured elastic modulus values for the coating ranged from 68. 4 {+-} 22. 6 GPa at <b>an</b> <b>indentation</b> load of 50 g to 35. 7 {+-} 9. 8 at <b>an</b> <b>indentation</b> load of 300 g. At higher loads, the elastic modulus values did not change significantly. This steady-state value of 35. 7 GPa for ZrO{sub 2 } TBC agreed well with literature values obtained by the Hertzian indentation method. Furthermore, the measured elastic modulus for the TBC is lower than that reported for bulk ZrO{sub 2 } ({approx} 190 GPa). This difference {{is believed to be}} due to the presence of a significant amount of porosity and microcracks in the TBCs. Hardness was also measured...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{reported}} from two molecular-dynamics simulations designed to yield {{insight into the}} engineering of nanometer-scale structures. The first is {{the initial stages of}} the <b>indentation</b> of <b>a</b> silicon substrate by an atomically-sharp diamond tip. Up to <b>an</b> <b>indentation</b> depth of approximately 0. 6 nm the substrate responds elastically and the profile of the disturbed region of the substrate normal to the surface reflects the shape of the tip apex. The disturbed region in the plane of the surface, however, reflects the symmetry of the substrate rather than that of the tip. <b>As</b> <b>indentation</b> progresses the damage to the substrate becomes irreversible, and the profile of the damage normal to the substrate surface approximately matches that of the tip, while the in-plane profile appears roughly circular rather than displaying the symmetry of either the tip or substrate. The tip maintains its integrity throughout the simulation, which had <b>a</b> maximum <b>indentation</b> depth of 1. 2 nm. The second study dem [...] ...|$|R
