40|$|Abstract — <b>Wireless</b> <b>applications,</b> <b>protocols</b> and {{simulators}} {{can significantly}} benefit from thorough understanding and accurate modeling {{of the medium}} access control (MAC) layer residual bit-errors at high bitrates. In this paper, we analyze and model the biterrors encountered at the highest achievable 11 Mbps data rate of an 802. 11 b wireless local area network. We employ autocorrelation, aggregation and variancetime analyses to reveal long-range dependence in the bit-error process. This renders traditional models (e. g., simple Markov, Poisson) ineffective and therefore we employ a multifractal wavelet model (MWM) to accurately characterize the bit-error process. Our results outline that the MWM captures the longrange-dependent behavior of the bit-errors quite accurately. We illustrate that the MWM outperforms high-order Markov chains in both channel modeling and complexity. I...|$|R

40|$|UML (Unified Modeling Language) {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{languages}} to specify and document informatics applications. However, UML is a generalpurpose language, so it often lacks of elements to model and represent concrete concepts of specifics domains. As a solution, OMG (Object Management Group) has created the profiles, a mechanism to extend the syntax and semantics of UML to express more specific concepts of certain application domains. In this work we present a UML profile for modeling WAP (<b>Wireless</b> <b>Applications</b> <b>Protocol)</b> <b>applications.</b> The main goal of the proposed profile is to extend UML to provide specifics elements (labeled classes, stereotypes, tagged values and constraints) that allow software developers to model WAP applications. The expressiveness of the UML diagrams allows modeling important stages of the process of common applications; nevertheless, the modeling process of WAP applications is still a too specific domain that can be hardly dealt with in its entirety without extending the language. In the process exists navigational, design and construction issues that cannot be modeled using the traditional elements of UML. However, by using the specific elements created by the proposed profile, these issues can be completely solved, and even a greater expressiveness can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Ad hoc {{wireless}} {{networks are}} decentralized networks whose members join {{and leave the}} network in an asynchronous manner and for short periods of time. Each node participating in the network acts both as host and a router Ad hoc networks in theory, support missions of the Armed Forces in situations in which the infrastructure for wire-bound networks is not dependable, it is impractical to build and maintain the infrastructure, or the missions requires that the nodes have a high-degree of mobility. Ad hoc wireless networks require some level of semantic interoperability so that nodes in the network can 'understand' each other. In this thesis we discuss requirements for semantic interoperability in ad hoc wireless networks, and present {{a case study of}} how such requirements could be applied. We realized during our study that semantic interoperability components and functions are developed mostly for wired networks, and not taking in consideration the wireless issues such as: processing, power, and networking limitations.

This allows expressing horizontal and vertical interoperability properties, i. e., between layers of a protocol stack or end-to-end communication between distant entities.

40|$|The Internet {{protocols}} {{were designed}} for a primarily “fixed ” and relatively static network environment where communication links are stable and exhibit fairly uniform communication characteristics. Mobile wireless communication has fundamentally invalidated some of these assumptions, for (heterogeneous) wireless access networks {{and even more so}} for mobile ad-hoc networks (MA-NETs) formed between mobile users: from highly variable link characteristics to temporary disconnections to non-existing end-toend paths. While many activities have focused on the link and network layer to provide seamless and ubiquitous connectivity for mobile users, thus mimicking the fixed Internet, and transport layer optimizations have addressed performance issues and connection persistence in <b>wireless</b> networks, <b>application</b> <b>protocols</b> have received rather little attention. However, the semantics of many of today’s non-real-time applications are perfectly compatible with partly connected and disruptive mobile environments, it is just the protocol designs that are not.

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Information Technology) Tshwane Univesrity of TechnologyThe idea of <b>wireless</b> <b>application</b> <b>protocols</b> (WAP) {{has been around}} for a while. Many organisations have {{invested}} heavily in developing these applications and services, but have failed to find the real benefits due to limitations of the most important aspect that could turn it into an everyday aspect of life, namely a reliable broadband connection. At the dawn of the wireless Internet, many organisations emerged with grand ideas of extending existing Internet content and services to mobile devices, making personal and corporate data and application services available anytime and anywhere. This dissertation proposes enhancements of the bidding process of m-auctions for agricultural virtual communities of practice. This application will be used to access auction market information on a portal developed by the Tshwane University of Technology for such a purpose using WAP technology. The farming community will receive real-time auction information and share knowledge through their mobile phones or personal digital assistants (PDA) when they need it. This will assist in making the community more effective and thus improving productivity. For example, knowledge of real market prices will put the farmer in a better position to negotiate with the middleman, offering to transport goods to the market. WAP is seen as a means of connecting wired networks to the new wireless networks. Wireless technology can provide agricultural communities with the opportunity to access vast amounts of information independently of their location. This, in turn, will open the door to m-commerce for these communities. The unified modelling language (UML) is used to aid the design and development of the simulation system with the application programme code written in WML. WMLScript is used for the implementation of the simulation. The simulation is demonstrated using the Nokia Toolkit. The dissertation is concluded with suggestions for future research and development based on the work throughout this research...|$|R

It uses the same number of messages as the instantaneous clock synchronization of the standard does, but provides continuous clock synchronization, and improves the precision by exploiting the tightness of the communication medium, and tolerates message losses. Due to message losses, synchronization intervals are of non-predictable length. Hence, the clock correction can not be simply spread over the synchron [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Demand for {{real-time}} services {{over the}} Internet while moving, is growing rapidly. This necessitates efficient de-livery of wireless real-time traffic. Limitations of exist-ing layered protocol stack for wireless networks {{lead to the}} proposal of cross-layer interactions as an alternative solution. At the same time, next generation ubiquitous computing drives <b>wireless</b> <b>applications</b> and <b>protocols</b> to be context aware. A generic context aware architecture with context modeling can aid increasingly demanding real-time applications over highly dynamic wireless networks to be cross-layer context aware and adaptive. Moreover, a generic architecture can make lower layer protocols to be context aware and adaptive to various situations dynam-ically. This article discusses the adaptive approach sup-ported by proposed cross layer context aware architecture called CA 3 RM-Com. The {{scope of this article}} is to discuss context modeling specifically and address the issue of con-text representation of multi-layer context for various adap-tive situations. Various single layer and multi-layer cross-layer adaptations and the representation of context param-eters with respect to each layer of the protocol stack is dis-cussed. We discuss how these adaptations can be operated in the proposed CA 3 RM-Com architecture.
