25|$|Fishery {{data for}} the Atlantic sawtail {{catshark}} is inadequate as it is still recorded as G. melastomus by observers. This species is caught incidentally on deepwater longlines and bottom trawls targeting other species, including <b>wreckfish</b> (Polyprion americanus), conger eel (Conger conger), Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus). Most landed sharks are discarded and likely suffer high mortality due to damage sustained during capture; the larger specimens are marketed for human consumption. Given the small extent of its range and the ubiquitous heavy fishing pressure within, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this shark as Near Threatened.|$|E

50|$|The Charleston Bump is a {{deepwater}} rocky ocean bottom feature approximately 90 miles (140 km) {{southeast of}} Charleston, South Carolina.

This deflection amplifies downstream eddies and gyres and enhances upwelling of nutrient rich waters onto the continental shelf.

5000|$|Like most seamounts, they attract fish. Over 175 {{species have}} been found there, {{including}} splendid alfonsino, black cardinal fish, black scabbardfish, and <b>wreckfish.</b> Trawl fishing during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in approximately 20,000 tons of fish being harvested. [...] As a result, the seamounts were closed to demersal fishing (collecting fish {{near the bottom of}} the ocean, as opposed to pelagic fishing, collecting fish near the surface) beginning 1 January 1997. The original ban was supposed to be lifted 31 December 2010, but was extended until 31 December 2020. Almost a decade into the ban, a 2005 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution survey found that two of the peaks, Kükenthal and Yakutat, had been stripped bare of both corals and bottom-dwelling animals. However the survey, which covered both the Corner Rise and New England Seamounts, found 270 species of invertebrates and crustaceans, including 70 species unique to the Corner Rise Seamounts.|$|E

40|$|The {{proximate}} {{composition and}} fatty acid profile of 62 <b>wreckfish</b> (Polyprion americanus) specimens {{caught in the}} northern marine area of the island of Sardinia in the Mediterranean Sea were determined. Over a 2 -year period, fish were captured in 14 surveys and grouped according to body size, sex, and harvest. Two distinct sizes were collected at different water depths: the largest <b>wreckfish</b> (> 16. 5 kg, > 65 cm) of both sexes were collected from deep waters (500 – 560 m); small individuals, with significantly lower body length and weight (4. 5 – 11 kg) were found in shallower waters. The smallest groups had the lowest moisture content (73. 19 – 73. 81 %), {{the greatest amount of}} protein (20. 42 – 20. 60 %) and the highest lipid level (4. 04 – 4. 36 %) compared to other groups. The three groups of the smaller sized <b>wreckfish</b> had the high proportion of 18 : 1 (27 – 27. 9 %). DHA was dominant in 11 of the <b>wreckfish</b> survey groups, representing 24. 2 – 25. 7 % of total fatty acids. Findings could potentially be applied to optimize feeding husbandry protocols of fish farming practices in aquaculture.

40|$|The <b>wreckfish</b> Polyprion americanus is a long-living {{pelagic fish}} with a {{demersal}} adult phase that shows an antitropical distribution along the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Previous genetic {{studies have suggested}} a significant differentiation between North Atlantic and South Atlantic populations using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers. Nevertheless it remains elusive whether further structuring exists within the apparently homogeneous north Atlantic stock. We have applied neutral microsatellite markers to temporal <b>wreckfish</b> samples from the whole north Atlantic in order to clarify the above scenario. Experimental data showed a global 12. 7 % differentiation among samples mainly due to divergence among three different gene pools: North Atlantic, South Atlantic and Oceania. However, Atlantic populations seem to be systematically connected through longitudinal migrations from Caroline waters to south-western Euro-African waters. This result is key to understand <b>wreckfish</b> population dynamics {{as well as to}} properly design its exploitation rules...|$|E
40|$|Nutritional {{requirements}} of <b>wreckfish</b> are unknow {{so far and}} {{there are only a}} few references related to feeding habitats from commercial caught (Brick Peres & Haimovi, 2003) and feeding rates in captivity (Papandroulakis et al., 2004). Recently some studies were done about composition of wild <b>wreckfish</b> (Roncarati et al., 2014, Linares et al., 2015). The optimum development of broodstock diets for <b>wreckfish</b> will be essential for the future of the aquaculture of this species. Dietary lipids and specially fatty acids play a critical role in the successful production of high quality gametes and eggs of marine fish (Izquierdo et al., 2001; Sargent et al., 2002). The aim of this work is collecting information about the influence of the feeding of <b>wreckfish</b> broodstock on oocytes composition with the aim of knowing the relationship of broodstock feeding on fecundity and spawn quality. This 5 -year-long project (2013 - 2018) has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (KBBE- 2013 - 07 single stage, GA 603121, DIVERSIFY). The consortium includes 38 partners from 12 European countries –including 9 SMEs, 2 Large Enterprises, 5 professional associations and 1 Consumer NGO- and is coordinated by the Hellenic Center for Marine Research, Greece.

40|$|The <b>wreckfish</b> Polyprion americanus is a {{component}} of directed and admixed species fisheries throughout its world range and has recently been identified for its aquaculture potential. Several <b>wreckfish</b> broodstocks were founded in Galician hatcheries {{in the last decade}} and are now approaching maturity. The combination of genetic markers with classic domestication strategies is a pertinent approach to preserve genetic variation and to slow down consanguineous-derived adverse effects. Genetic data from microsatellites used to characterize four Galician <b>wreckfish</b> stocks provide evidence of both, a significant interstock differentiation (7. 60 %) and a pronounced loss of allele diversity (26 %) in 80 % of the stocks. Such artificial sub-structuring linked to the erosion of gene diversity is most likely caused by sampling drift that stepped up from the North Atlantic population. Computer simulation of relatedness helps to appraise alternate breeding protocols to avoid uncontrolled inbreeding within stocks. We show that under a fixed number of breeders and a sex balanced contribution, two protocols consisting on randommatingamong broodstocks (ΔRxy= 2. 21 %) or enhancedwith a wild sample (ΔRxy= 0. 97 %), are far more advantageous strategies to slow inbreeding in F 1 and F 2 than breeding protocols within stock (ΔRxy= 6. 6 %).
