5|$|Anne {{was born}} on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom of Denmark. Her birth came as a blow to her father, King Frederick II of Denmark, who <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> hoping for a son. But her mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, was only 17; three years later she did bear Frederick a son, the future Christian IV of Denmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Jesse Thrash was the team's first All-Southern selection. He {{began the}} season as a sub and closed it as the undisputed star of the Tech team. Oliver Jones Huie was {{selected}} by Ga Tech's athletic association to coach the football team for the 1903 season when the team won 3 and lost 5 games. A professional coach <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> needed if Tech wished to build a truly competitive football program. The {{first game of the}} 1903 season was a 73–0 destruction at the hands of John Heisman's Clemson; shortly after the season, Tech offered Heisman a coaching position.|$|E
5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} to stay financially afloat. National income <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> needed and most came from tariffs on imported goods. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service for the United States.|$|E

5|$|Eagle {{spent the}} first nine months of World War II in the Indian Ocean searching for German {{commerce}} raiders. During the early part of the war, the Fleet Air Arm <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> short of fighters and Eagle was equipped solely with Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940, where she escorted convoys to Malta and Greece and attacked Italian shipping, naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship also participated in the Battle of Calabria in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle. Whenever Eagle was not at sea, her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore.|$|E
5|$|Leake had {{not brought}} many {{supplies}} to Gibraltar but provided what he could, and loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, {{of which the}} confederate garrison <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work repairing the fortifications, remounting guns dislodged by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the Rock to increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries. One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent role that the track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1832, the militiamen {{caught up}} with the British Band near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. To buy time for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that became known as the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen. The battle was a {{lopsided}} victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors. Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, including many women and children, to escape across the river. Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers when they learned of it.|$|E

5|$|Romas keel {{was laid}} by the Italian {{shipbuilder}} Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico on 18 September 1938, {{and she was}} launched on 9 June 1940. After just over two years of fitting-out, the new battleship was commissioned into the Regia Marina on 14 June 1942. She arrived in the major naval base of Taranto on 21 August, and {{was assigned to the}} Ninth Naval Division. Although Roma took part in training exercises and was moved to various bases including Taranto, Naples, and La Spezia, in the next year, she did not go on any combat missions as the Italian Navy <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> short of fuel. In fact, by the end of 1942, the only combat-ready battleships in the navy were the three Vittorio Venetos because the fuel shortage had caused the four modernized battleships to be removed from service. When combined with a lack of capable vessels to escort the capital ships, the combat potential of the Italian Navy was virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} {{was faced with}} the reawakening of labor-management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years, severe shortages in housing and consumer products, and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation, which at one point hit 6% in a single month. Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries. Truman's response to them was generally seen as ineffective. A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of price controls on most items, and labor sought wage increases. A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800,000 workers—the largest in the nation's history—was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May. The public was angry, with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year's moratorium on labor actions. For commodities where price controls remained, producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices: farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased, even though grain <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> needed, not only for domestic use, but to stave off starvation in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Freiburg (August) <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> contested, {{but in the}} end the French army won a {{great victory}} over the Bavarians and Imperialists, {{commanded}} by Franz Baron von Mercy. As after Rocroi, numerous fortresses opened their gates to the duke.|$|E

25|$|At the {{election}} of the Sheriffs of London in July 1682, the Tory candidates prevailed. Shaftesbury was worried that these Sheriffs would be able to fill juries with Tory supporters and he <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> afraid of another prosecution for high treason. Shaftesbury, therefore began discussions with Monmouth, Russell, and Grey to launch co-ordinated rebellions {{in different parts of the}} country. Shaftesbury was much more eager for a rebellion than the other three, and the uprising was postponed several times, to Shaftesbury's chagrin.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1837 suspension, the bank had over $1.5 million in federal deposits. Because of the {{nationwide}} suspension, the federal government <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> short of hard money. Lanier personally delivered $80,000 in hard money to Levi Woodbury, the Secretary of the Treasury, knowing their situation. Because the bank {{was the only one in}} the nation that voluntarily gave hard money to the treasury, the treasury increased their deposit amount in the bank, further adding to its stability.|$|E
25|$|The Vichy French Metropolitan Army was {{deprived}} of tanks and other armored vehicles, and <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> short of motorized transport, {{a particular problem}} for cavalry units. Surviving recruiting posters stress the opportunities for athletic activities, including horsemanship, reflecting both the general emphasis placed by the Vichy government on rural virtues and outdoor activities, and the realities of service in a small and technologically backward military force. Traditional features characteristic of the pre-1940 French Army, such as kepis and heavy capotes (buttoned-back greatcoats) were replaced by berets and simplified uniforms.|$|E

25|$|John Bosco narrates how Dominic came to {{his room}} one day and urged him to {{accompany}} him. He led Bosco through many streets to a block of flats, rang the doorbell, and at once, went away. When the door opened, John Bosco found that within, there was a dying man who <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> asking for a priest to make his last confession. Later, John Bosco asked Dominic how he had known about that man. However, since the question made Dominic uncomfortable, John Bosco did not press the matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{second line}} was to {{parallel}} the Caspian coast from Hazi Aslanov through Baku's industrial districts, meeting {{the first line}} again at the Baku Railway Terminal, and then continuing westwards before turning north to join Baku's northwestern districts. To accelerate construction, a branch was opened from May 28 station to Khatai in 1968, and in 1976 {{in the opposite direction}} towards Nizami. The second and first line used the same station (May 28). This posed no serious problems initially, as the line was two stations long, but when the second stage opened in 1985, lengthening the line to 8 stations (Memar Ajemi), construction of a transfer <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> needed.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as he}} {{left the}} office on 1 January 293, Megellus was {{immediately}} threatened with impeachment for his actions as consul by one of the tribunes, Marcus Cantius. With the ongoing crisis of the Samnite war, however, his military ability meant that he <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> needed. Consequently, he was appointed legatus to the consul Spurius Carvilius Maximus, and agreement was reached to suspend his prosecution {{until the end of the}} campaigning season. However, the victories achieved by Carvilius Maximus, especially the Battle of Aquilonia, at which Megellus fought, resulted in the trial never taking place, as his opponents believed that his popularity meant that he would have inevitably been found innocent.|$|E

25|$|Uli Schmidt, son of Louis Schmidt, was {{the prince}} of hookers and a genius of a player. A medical doctor by {{profession}} he was a favourite amongst all Bulls supporters, even when leaving Northerns for arch-enemies Transvaal {{at the beginning of}} the 1993 season. Thanks to his fiery performance and expertise he played many times for his province and country and <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> unlucky to miss out on the 1995 World Cup year due to a neck injury. If he had been able to play test rugby on a regular basis especially during the late 1980s, he would probably have been regarded as one of the world's greatest hookers. Legendary All Black lock, Colin Meads, in fact described Schmidt as the world's best hooker.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the A2 class {{was at the}} end of its life, and new motive power <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> required. Australian Federal Government {{restrictions}} on the availability of US dollars (designed to favour trade within the British Empire) precluded the VR from purchasing American diesel-electric locomotives. The VR broke with a long-standing policy of in-house steam locomotive construction and called for tenders to construct an additional 50 R class. The contract was awarded to North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow, Scotland on 21 September 1949. The order was increased to 70 on 12 January 1950 with the cancellation of the original order of 20 locomotives from VR's Newport Workshops. Parts manufactured for the Newport order were used to complete the NBL-built locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Hood and Stuart {{agreed that}} they would not permit Calvi to hold beyond 10 August, but on the evening of 28 July four small vessels {{carrying}} supplies slipped through the meagre British blockade, to cheers from the defenders. The offer of surrender was withdrawn, and firing resumed once more on both sides at 17:00, but these ships brought no ammunition, for which Calvi <b>was</b> <b>desperately</b> short, and on 31 July a new offer of a truce was made and accepted by Stuart, to last six days. On 10 August, after 51 days of siege, Casabianca capitulated as arranged, his men marching from the town and laying their arms down before the commander signed terms with Stuart that guaranteed his repatriation to France with his surviving garrison.|$|E
