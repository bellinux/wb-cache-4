After giving her third album a major label re-release, Sire released her fourth album, Begin to Hope, which {{would go on}} to achieve a Gold certification by the RIAA. Her following two albums, Far and <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Saw</b> from the Cheap Seats, each debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} a {{criticism}} of the failures of capitalism during the Great Depression; Ward stated the title [...] "was meant {{to suggest that the}} illogic of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> happening all around us in the thirties was enough to set the mind spinning through space and the emotions hurtling from great hope to the depths of despair". [...] Ward had strong socialist sympathies and was a supporter of organized labor; the Boy expresses this union solidarity by abandoning the only job he could find rather than work as a strikebreaker.|$|E

500|$|... "The Spanish Teacher" [...] {{was given}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "much of this episode {{felt like a}} very deliberate throwback to season one, in some very good ways", and IGN's Robert Canning said that [...] "the overarching storylines on Glee have become far more engaging than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> {{in the first half}} of the season". John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode [...] "does a lot of things right when it comes to the plot", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as [...] "consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode [...] "brought more narrative developments that didn’t make sense", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, [...] "the rest of the episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times liked the episode and described it as [...] "the kind that makes you belly-laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment".|$|E
500|$|Several {{breaking}} {{practitioners and}} pioneers tend {{to side with}} the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira. B-boy Crazy Legs states: [...] "We didn't know what the f-ck no capoeira was, man. We were in the ghetto!" [...] According to Pabon, [...] "Unlike the popularity of the martial arts films, capoeira was not seen in the Bronx jams until the 1990s. Top rockin' seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally, leaving space for growth and new additions, until it evolved into a codified form." [...] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: [...] "Despite of [...] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance." [...] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: [...] "In '78 I started [...] and I didn't see it [...] til '92 ... I was around, too—I was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, I went around and I didn't see it. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> was Kung Fu—we saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... when we did the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it up and we put this B-boy flavor into it..." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} revival {{to break away}} from the {{original}} staging and interpretation was an Australian production directed by Christopher Renshaw, starring Hayley Mills as Anna, in 1991. Renshaw pointedly ignored the printed stage directions in the script when reshaping the piece into what he called [...] "an authentic Thai experience". The production had a more sinister Siamese setting, a less elegant but more forceful Anna, and a younger King (Tony Marinyo). The attraction between Anna and the King was made explicit. Renshaw [...] "cut a few lines and lyrics, and translated others into Thai to reinforce the atmosphere of a foreign land", and all Asian roles were played by Asian actors. He also asked choreographers Lar Lubovitch and Jerome Robbins to create a [...] "spiritual" [...] ballet, for the King's entrance in Act 1, and a procession with a sacred white elephant in Act II. According to Renshaw, [...] "The reds and golds were very much inspired by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> at the royal palace", and set and costume elements reflected images, architecture and other designs in the palace and elsewhere in Bangkok. For example, the stage was framed by columns of elephant figures, a large emerald Buddha loomed over Act I, and hundreds of elephant images were woven into the set. Renshaw said, [...] "The elephant is regarded as a very holy creature ... they believe the spirit of Buddha often resides {{in the form of the}} elephant." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the season, on 31 May 2008, Milan {{vice-president}} Adriano Galliani {{revealed that}} the club would loan Gourcuff to French club Bordeaux for the entire 2008–09 season to allow him more playing time. In 2010, {{in an interview with}} French newspaper L'Equipe, former Milan captain Paolo Maldini stated that Gourcuff lacked discipline while at the club and often distanced himself from the team citing the player's refusal to learn the Italian language. Maldini also stated that Gourcuff did not give his all during his stint at Milan and that the player himself knew it. Gourcuff did not respond to the comments, but his father Christian did, stating to France Football that {{there was some sort of}} conspiracy out there looking to tarnish his son's image. The elder Gourcuff responded to Maldini's charges stating his son [...] "took two hours (of Italian language courses) per day and spoke Italian after two months" [...] and that [...] "he is passionate about tactics" [...] in response to Maldini saying Gourcuff refused to learn Italian and he was limited tactically. Gourcuff was also defended by his club president Jean-Louis Triaud at his former club Bordeaux who stated in response to Maldini's comments [...] "Yoann is not like that. A number ten who does not play with the group is a little weird. This does not correspond at all to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> with Yoann at Bordeaux. He was well integrated with his teammates, and collectively with them on the ground. He left good memories here." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." [...] In contrast, Kelly West of TV Blend was critical of the premiere, writing: [...] "I don’t think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spektor's sixth album, <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Saw</b> {{from the}} Cheap Seats was {{released}} May 29, 2012. Like her previous album, it debuted at number {{three on the}} Billboard 200.

For instance, events were sometimes portrayed in Klanwatch Intelligence Reports as more militant and dangerous with higher turnouts than we observed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, President Bush {{argued that}} the unrest was [...] "purely criminal". Though he {{acknowledged}} that the King verdicts were plainly unjust, he maintained that [...] "we simply cannot condone violence {{as a way of}} changing the system ... Mob brutality, the total loss of respect for human life was sickeningly sad ... <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> last night and the night before in Los Angeles is not about civil rights. It's not about the great cause of equality that all Americans must uphold. It's not a message of protest. It's been the brutality of a mob, pure and simple." ...|$|E
60|$|Out of Cherbourg we steamed again, sulky enough; for {{the delay}} would cause us to get home on the Sunday evening instead of the Sunday morning; and ran northward for the Needles.

With <b>what</b> joy <b>we</b> first discerned that huge outline of a visage on Freshwater Cliff, so well known to sailors, which, as the eye catches it in one direction, is a ridiculous caricature; in another, really noble, and even beautiful. With <b>what</b> joy did <b>we</b> round the old Needles, and run past Hurst Castle; and with what shivering, too.

5000|$|At 4:58 pm, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley held a {{news conference}} to discuss the {{verdicts}} handed down for the four LAPD police officers. Incensed, his statement showed both anger toward the verdicts and made an appeal for calm. Today, the jury told the world that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> all <b>saw</b> with our own eyes was not a crime. My friends, I am here to tell the jury...what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> was a crime. No, we will not tolerate the savage beating of our citizens by a few renegade cops....We must not endanger the reforms we have achieved by resorting to mindless acts. We must not push back progress by striking back blindly. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley [...] Assistant Los Angeles police chief Bob Vernon believed Bradley's opening remarks invited a riot, and were perhaps taken as a signal by some citizens to act in violence. Vernon backed this statement with the assertion that the number of police incidents rose in the hour after the mayor's press conference.|$|R
2500|$|Act-On {{was founded}} in 2008 by Raghu Raghavan, {{formerly}} a founder of Responsys, after he saw [...] "potential for a sophisticated, but affordable SaaS marketing tool mid-market companies could easily use." [...] Act-On initially sold through alternate channels, but later created its own sales team. Entering the market after several competitors had been established, Act-On had a second-mover advantage, learning from the success and failures of earlier market entrants. Raghavan commented in a 2013 interview, [...] "We came in, we saw {{all of the things}} that had not been done right in this space, and I think it allowed us to build a company in a whole new way to attack <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> in the monsters' market." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the world}} at large, Mao Zedong emerged {{as a symbol of}} the anti-establishment, {{grassroots}} populism, and self-determination.

In 2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang remarked that the Cultural Revolution represented the 'dangers of democracy', remarking [...] "People can go to the extreme like <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> during the Cultural Revolution , when people take everything into their own hands, then you cannot govern the place".

[...] Carter explained, [...] "It was apparent that corporations, or the multinationals, were getting much larger, their influence was growing within the government, and the United States is a racist place."

The old people appeared remarkably well preserved, as if by the saltness of the atmosphere, and after having once mistaken, we could never be certain whether we were talking to a coeval of our grandparents, or to one of our own age. They are said to be more purely the descendants of the Pilgrims than the inhabitants of any other part of the State. We were told that [...] "sometimes, when the court comes together at Barnstable, they have not a single criminal to try, and the jail is shut up."

2500|$|The {{political}} situation in Tibet makes the area especially sensitive, {{but it is also}} reported by some Western media that a number of simmering socio-economic issues may have led to the riots in Lhasa on March 14. The Economist reporter James Miles, when asked in an interview if the Dalai Lama was responsible for the riots, responded that he [...] "didn't see any evidence of any organized activity" [...] and that [...] "it's more likely that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> was yes inspired by a general desire of Tibetans both inside Tibet and among the Dalai Lama's followers, {{to take advantage of this}} Olympic year. But also inspired simply by all these festering grievances on the ground in Lhasa," [...] and he noted in another report that [...] " [...] rioting seemed to be primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred."

2500|$|In 1966, {{a string}} of UFO {{sightings}} in Massachusetts and New Hampshire provoked a Congressional Hearing by the House Committee on Armed Services. According to attachments to the hearing, the Air Force had at first stated that the sightings {{were the result of}} a training exercise happening in the area. But NICAP, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, reported that there was no record of a plane flying at the time the sightings occurred. [...] Another report alleged that the UFO was actually a flying billboard advertising gasoline. Raymond Fowler (of NICAP) added his own interviews with the locals, who saw Air Force officers confiscating newspapers with the story of UFOs and telling them not to report what they had seen. Two police officers who had witnessed the UFOs, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, wrote a letter to Major Quintanilla stating that they felt their reputations were destroyed by the Air Force.

Louis Vauxcelles coined the phrase les fauves ('the wild beasts') to describe a circle of painters exhibiting in the same room as a classical sculpture. He stated his criticism of their works by describing the sculpture as [...] "a Donatello amongst wild beasts" [...] (Donatello chez les fauves). Another art critic responding to the Salon d'Automne, , wrote in the Journal de Rouen on 20 November that these works have [...] "no relation to painting" [...] and compared them to [...] "the barbaric and naïve games of a child who plays with a box of colors". Of Pinchon's three paintings (Le Pont Transbordeur à Rouen, Le Pont de Boieldieu, à Rouen, Vieilles Cabanes dans l'Île Lacroix, à Rouen) he wrote: [...] "Showing for his first time in Paris... the technique is a bit heavy, but we shouldn't be too severe toward a beginner, especially after <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> elsewhere in the Salon". Though Pinchon had not exhibited in room VII with the fauves, his palette was already pure and his impasto thick.|$|E
