5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes {{may have been due}} to the word becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} {{the morale of the}} Muslim fighters. However, he <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{said that}} he was working on defense {{balloons}} that could stop them in case of an attack against the United States through a company in Chicago, known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company. The newspapers printed a counterview that <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> Jingoism and starting rumors that could lead to developing unwanted war airships or a cause for other nations to make military equipment against this new war technology.|$|E

5|$|The abrupt {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> eventually occurred eight years later. This {{resulted in the}} alienation of the second Viscount of Uruguai's ultraconservative faction and powerful political interests. These formed a subversive alliance with republicans and discontented military officers {{which led to the}} overthrow of the Empire on 15 November 1889.|$|E
5|$|Gernet {{points out}} that {{disputes}} requiring arrest were mostly avoided or settled privately. Yet historian Patricia Ebrey states that legal cases in the Song period portrayed the courts as being overwhelmed with cases of neighbors and relatives suing each other over property rights. The Song author and official Yuan Cai (1140–1190) repeatedly <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> this, and like other officials of his time also cautioned his readers about the rise of banditry in Southern Song society and a need to physically protect self and property.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, hostility towards Dissenters increased. A Bill against {{occasional}} conformity was {{passed through the}} House of Commons and debated in the Lords. Figures such as Henry Sacheverell, a High church clergyman, <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> Dissenters assuming positions of political power. His lead {{was followed by the}} Tory press, who published a number of sermons and pamphlets making similar arguments. In December, Defoe published his own pamphlet, The Shortest Way, assuming the same stylistic conventions as the Sacheverell and the Tory publications.|$|E

5|$|Just {{ahead of}} the opening match of the 2016–17 season, Ranieri cautioned against {{excessive}} hope of City retaining the title arguing that the other clubs now understood Leicester's break tactics. His principle objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> overconfidence against relegation favourites – by implication, their next opponents, newly promoted Hull City. His view on Leicester's chances were shared by Gary Lineker, who said that N'Golo Kanté, who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been Leicester's most important player and essential to Ranieri's system.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen {{visited the}} Soviet Union in May 1965, in which Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> the {{installation}} {{and stated that}} the Soviet Union would build a counter-station. In June, the Soviet Consul in Barentsburg came on an inspection to the installation, and on 2 July a Soviet helicopter crashed at the construction site after having, presumably unintentionally, touched a mast. Soviet demands to have permanent Soviet inspectors of the facility were rejected. The Svalbard Treaty does not include any verification procedure, and as such no signatories {{have the right to}} conduct inspections.|$|E

Citing the English doctor Thomas Sydenham, he suggested the construction of an isolated country house as a hospital.|$|E

5|$|The {{deployment}} of Spitfires to Australia was kept secret {{so that the}} Japanese were not alerted to their presence, and the Australian Government directed that the aircraft {{be referred to as}} Capstans (after the brand of cigarettes) and their Merlin engines as Marvels. General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, agreed that the Australian Government could choose when to announce the presence of the Spitfires, but <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> exaggerating the impact they were likely to have.|$|E
5|$|There {{continue}} to be concerns over the incidence of sexual abuse and gender-based discrimination in the ADF. In 2014 the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce estimated that around 1,100 currently-serving ADF personnel had abused {{other members of the}} military, and recommended that a royal commission be conducted to investigate long-running allegations of sexual abuse and assault of servicewomen at the Australian Defence Force Academy. In 2013 Chief of Army General David Morrison publicly released a video in which he <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> gender-based discrimination, and stated that he would dismiss members of the Army who engaged in such conduct.|$|E
5|$|Architects and conservationists {{argued that}} the pier was architecturally {{significant}} to Hong Kong {{as one of the}} last remaining examples of a Streamline Moderne public building (along with the Central Market and Wan Chai Market which have been earmarked for demolition); culturally the pier was widely recognised as a part of local collective memory. The Hong Kong Institute of Architects <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> the destruction of Hong Kong's heritage, saying it would be an irreversible mistake. Public opinion has resulted in alternatives put forward to preserve the clock tower, including moving the proposed six-lane road or relocating the clock tower {{to the front of the}} new pier as a memorial.|$|E

5|$|Shoup later <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> {{an armed}} {{response}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis, noting {{how difficult it}} would be to invade the country. Still, he prepared a team of Marines to invade Cuba should it be necessary. He and the other Joint Chiefs unanimously recommended a quick airstrike to knock out the missiles once they were discovered there. Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria were <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> {{her having}} more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1940, Quisling flew to Berlin to {{negotiate}} the future of Norway's independence. By the time he returned on 13December, he had agreed to raise volunteers to fight with the German Schutzstaffel (SS). In January, SS head Heinrich Himmler travelled to Norway to oversee preparations. Quisling clearly believed that if Norway supported Nazi Germany on the battlefield, {{there would be no}} reason for Germany to annex her. To this end, he opposed plans to have a German SS brigade loyal only to Hitler installed in Norway. In the process, he also toughened his attitude to the country harbouring the exiled king, the United Kingdom, which he no longer saw as a Nordic ally. Finally, Quisling aligned Norwegian policy on Jews with that of Germany, giving a speech in Frankfurt on 26 March 1941 in which he argued for compulsory exile, but <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> extermination.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, {{permission to use}} the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) <b>warned</b> <b>against</b> a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E
