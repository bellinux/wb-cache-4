40|$|Introduction and background: Initially {{originating}} {{in the field of}} mental health and disability, supportive housing has come to represent an important component in contemporary efforts to end homelessness in Australia and abroad. With its eclectic evolution across disciplinary boundaries, supportive housing encompasses an array of service models that seek to integrate the provision of affordable ongoing housing and support to different target groups with varying strengths and vulnerabilities. We conceptualise supportive housing as any package of assistance that aims to assist tenants with a broad range of health and other aspects of their lives including access to and sustaining of affordable tenancies. Affordable tenancies can be in social housing or the private rental sector, although in the contemporary Australian context most approaches to supportive housing rely on social housing. This definition includes supportive housing in either scattered-site housing with outreach support or single-site housing with onsite support. The support provided can vary from low through to high intensity, but extends beyond one off, short-term or time-determined transitional engagement. The level and intensity of support is voluntary and determined by the tenant; the provision of tenancy and support services are integrated, but decoupled in that accessing housing is not contingent upon accessing support or complying with the requirements of support providers. Both the majority of the evidence generated about the effectiveness of support housing and the research advocating for the critical features of supportive housing are predominantly based on literature from North America. The international literature demonstrates that normality and permanence of housing, together with tenant autonomy and self-determination, are critical features of supportive housing (Parsell & Moutou 2014). There is a critical need to advance our understanding of whether supportive housing in Australia is based on similar philosophical premises (more or less autonomy, normality, permanence) and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> toward different groups of people...|$|R

40|$|This MA Thesis aims to {{critically}} {{investigate the}} role of discourse for the issue of climate change. It focuses on the discourse produced at science-policy interface {{by one of the}} most authoritative actors in the climate change debate, the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The present study adopts a critical discourse-analytic approach and a linguistic method to assess the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) produced {{as a part of the}} IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. The research is motivated by previous studies demonstrating the challenging nature of communicating on climate change. Furthermore, the study is dedicated to finding explanations for controversy and inaction that continue to characterise society’s responses to the scientific information on climate change. The IPCC is widely considered as an objective scientific organisation. The present study aims to assess its objectivity by uncovering implicit argumentation in the SPM and analysing the argumentative orientation in relation to <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> towards encouragement or discouragement for climate action. Implicit argumentation is uncovered with a method based on the framework of Scandinavian Theory of Linguistic Polyphony. The polyphonic constructions are identified by detecting polyphonic markers but in the text. The 23 constructions of implicit polyphony found in the data were concerned with three broad themes: urgency, ability to respond, and adverse effects of mitigation. Seven constructions oriented the discourse towards encouragement for action by highlighting the urgency of climate change or positively evaluating the ability to respond. In contrast, the majority of the constructions oriented the discourse towards discouragement. These constructions were undermining statements of urgency and positive evaluations of the methods available by highlighting the following aspects: 1) uncertainties in the current knowledge relating to the urgency of climate change, 2) negative evaluations of the potential of current knowledge to inform mitigation and adaptation, and 3) negative consequences of mitigation. The findings were discussed according to the traditions of critical discourse analysis from the point of view of the production as well as the consumption of the text. The pursuit of consensus, disciplinary bias, political pressures, and influence of the neoliberal ideology were among the explanations given to the dominance of discouragement in the polyphonic constructions in the SPM. Regarding the reception of the report, the dominance of discouragement was argued to offer discursive tools for policymakers to avoid responsibility and delay climate action. Furthermore, this argumentative orientation was suggested to further legitimate the dominant economic paradigm. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> concluded that transparency concerning the bias and increased disciplinary balance may help to tackle the discouraging effect of the reports in the future...|$|R
40|$|Architecture is {{more often}} than not in the habit of {{creating}} spaces separated by generally impermeable partitions that give occupants a high level of control - <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> at achieving shelter, privacy, etc [...] While this does address basic human needs, it tends to lead to structures with subdivided interiors. Such a system is useful in programs that call for a high degree of control with regards to privacy and climatic control, however in certain programs, this can result in a loss of cohesion in the design as well as a loss of connectivity between key elements and moments in the architecture. Alternatively, some architects have explored the notion of an architecture that is laid out in an open gradated condition as opposed to being defined by strict barriers. Such a proposal opens up the possibility for a program that is transparent and free to fluctuate under certain conditions. Conversely, it loses the privacy and control provided by a typical partitioned and enclosed design. This thesis proposes that architecture {{does not need to be}} solely laid out in either subdivided spaces or open gradated ones. Instead it puts forth the possibility that architecture can be enriched by making a careful amalgamation of both autonomous zones that develop key independent moments alongside fluid spaces that lend to the creation of continuous transitions and gradated program. Each system has its merits and disadvantages, and thus each can be carefully applied to programmatic elements that call for one over the other. This provides continual transitions and shifting programmatic potential, simultaneously transforming areas of high control from blocked off rooms to key architectural moments emphasized by a sudden degree of separation in an otherwise fluid system. To help ‘dissolve the wall’ in fluid spaces, the qualities normally hidden in wall space such as systems and insulation are translated into the habitable space by means of microclimatic augmentation. These ideas are further explored vis-a-vis a design proposal of a hypothetical a library based in Amman, Jordan that encompasses both kinds of spaces. Modern library programs extend from traditional book storage to include public activity (such as art galleries and event spaces) as well as elements that require climatic control or privacy (such as rare book rooms and digital media centers). This makes it a suitable program for exploration of both kinds of spatial layouts, and the site’s predictable geo-climatic qualities lend to a greater degree of experimentation in layouts and climatic enhancement of spaces...|$|R
