40|$|With the {{expansion}} of computer networks,the mobile terminal with <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> <b>capability</b> experience {{a sharp increase in}} the number of wireless routers, especially low cost wireless routers are becoming very important network equipment. This paper designs a wireless router based on the ARM platform, the Linux system. First, there is a research and analysis on the working principle and implementation of Network Address Translation (NAT) technology. Then I study the IPTABLES components under the Linux system and use it when processing data packets which go into the chain and the table and finally using laptop with Ethernet card and the WIFI card to build the Linux operating system. Related routing forwarding rules are defined between the two cards and use IPTABLES to achieve a laptop as a wireless WIFI hotspot providing routing and network connections to other computer services. It proves this paper's design, and production feasibility. The paper also discusses the design and production method of the wireless router with ARM board feasibility.

40|$|Network {{appliances}} {{are getting}} more popular and common both in the household and in industry. As more items become network aware, the variety of items also increases drastically. This leads to more heterogeneous systems with different vendors providing different implementations. As network appliances' functionality is expanded, people develop a greater dependence on them and hence their status and the ease of controlling them become of paramount importance. It is also beneficial for the network appliances {{to be able to}} integrate with a large existing network for easier access. TCP/IP is a protocol with a large user base and is also the protocol of choice for the Internet. It is also a well-tested and used protocol that is robust with many well developed hardware and even <b>wireless</b> <b>access.</b> <b>capabilities.</b> This makes TCP/IP a suitable protocol to link network appliances or at least to link them to the outside. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the network management protocol of choice for TCP/IP. It is vital that the management protocol has sufficient security, as it might be disastrous for many networked appliances if exposed to unauthorized access such as alarms and temperature control. APSSNMP (Application Secure SNMP) as proposed, is a simpler implementation that is easier and less costly to implement. It is also resistant to masquerade, modification, replay threats and also provide confidentiality. APSSNMP can be easily extended on the agent and provide backward compatibility with other devices implementing SNM...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIEEE 802. 16 e is {{expected}} to support mobility for broadband <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> with the <b>capability</b> of delivering high data rates over long ranges. We consider IEEE 802. 216 e scheme for scheduling and mapping higher layer data into the basic resource allocation units (slots) of OFDMA frames. Then, we introduce two simple allocation schemes that consider fair allocation among users with adaptive modulation. Both scheduling and mapping approaches {{are based on the}} quality of service (QoS) requirements of each service flow in terms of data rate and bit error rate (BER). The performance of both algorithms is studied by simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithms yield fairness among real-time and non real-time service flows as well as guaranteeing their constraint in term of QoS and outage probability...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are provided {{for determining the}} location of a mobile device using multiple <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> points, each <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> point comprising multiple antennas. The method comprises receiving a communication signal from the mobile device at said multiple antennas of said multiple <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> points. For each <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> point, angle-of-arrival information of the received communication signal at the <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> point is determined, based on a difference in phase of the received signal between different antennas. The determined angle-of-arrival information for the received communication signal from the mobile device is then collected from each of the multiple <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> points, and the location of the mobile device is estimated from the collected angle-of-arrival information.

40|$|Abstract — Broadband <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> {{networks}} {{have the potential}} to fulfil the vision of high-speed ubiquitous Internet access. Due to the unreliability and heterogeneity of the network, operators are particularly challenged to provide ”Carrier Grade” services that ensure a secure, efficient and reliable access to users. This paper provides an overview of these challenges and presents a network architecture and overarching services that form a unified and reliable carrier grade <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> network. Particular focus of the paper is on wireless mesh multihop networks as they are a viable solution to realise broadband <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> flexibly and cost efficiently. Moreover, we describe a next-generation <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> network testbed where the architecture and services will be deployed and provide initial simulation and measurement results.

30|$|Nowadays {{a mobile}} {{terminal}} (MT) with multiple radio transceivers can connect to different <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> networks.

However, any single type of existing wireless and mobile networks cannot meet these requirements. Therefore, heterogeneous <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> networks have become more and more attractive and they have been built up as a short-distance <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> network to satisfy different kinds of applications, such as wireless meeting rooms, wireless E-education, smart houses, and so on.|$|R
