5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be {{seized by the}} government due to unsound lending practices. Gray, <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E

25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is said to}} run in quasilinear time (also referred to as log-linear time) if T(n) = O(n logk n) for some positive constant k; linearithmic time is the case knbsp&=nbsp&1. Using soft O notation these algorithms are Õ(n). Quasilinear time algorithms are also O(n1+ε) for every constant ε > 0, and thus run faster than any polynomial time algorithm <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> bound includes a term n'c for any cnbsp&>nbsp&1.|$|E
50|$|The event {{also serves}} as a {{qualifying}} race for entry into the Boston Marathon for participants <b>whose</b> <b>times</b> meet age group bracketed standards. The race also features a state of the art timing system, using a small chip that attached to the back of each runner's bib that provides a 'chip time' for when the person has crossed the start and finish lines, as well as giving a traditional 'gun time'.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} file system metadata, user {{expectations}} about MAC times can be violated by programs {{which are not}} metadata-aware. Some file-copying utilities will explicitly set MAC times of the new copy to match those of the original file, while programs that simply create a new file, read {{the contents of the}} original, and write that data into the new copy, will produce new files <b>whose</b> <b>times</b> do not match those of the original.|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} {{controlled}} twice by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily: in *1135-1158 and in *1284-1333. During {{the second of}} these periods it was organised as a feudal lordship, with the following Lords of Jerba: 1284-1305 Roger I, 1305-1307 and 1307-1310 Roger II (twice), 1310 Charles, 1310 Francis-Roger III; there were also royal governors, <b>whose</b> <b>times</b> in power partially overlapped {{with those of the}} Lords: c. 1305-1308 Simon de Montolieu, 1308-1315 Ramon Muntaner.|$|R
25|$|In optics, an ultrashort {{pulse of}} light is an {{electromagnetic}} pulse <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> duration {{is of the}} order of a picosecond (1012 second) or less. Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum, and can be created by mode-locked oscillators. They are commonly referred to as ultrafast events. Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification, in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Susan B. Anthony, {{a long-time}} {{leader in the}} {{suffrage}} movement, was the dominant figure in the newly formed NAWSA. Carrie Chapman Catt, who became president after Anthony retired in 1900, implemented a strategy of recruiting wealthy members of the rapidly growing women's club movement, <b>whose</b> <b>time,</b> money and experience could help build the suffrage movement. Anna Howard Shaw's term in office, which began in 1904, saw strong growth in the organization's membership and public approval.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Toshihiko Seko {{won in a}} time of 2:09:45 hours, {{just four}} seconds ahead of Takeshi So. This {{represented}} the first time that two men had completed the marathon distance under two hours and ten minutes at the same competition. The second world record of the competition's history came in 1981 and it was again an Australian runner, this time Robert de Castella, <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> of 2:08:18 hours became the new world standard.|$|E

However, Gramsci's sympathies then did not lie with socialism, but rather with the grievances of impoverished Sardinian peasants and miners. They perceived their neglect {{as a result of}} privileges enjoyed by the rapidly industrialising North, and they tended to turn to a growing Sardinian nationalism, brutally repressed by troops from the Italian mainland, as a response.|$|E

25|$|Through Samo and via Sens {{this ancient}} Vedic-Buddhist symbol was {{modified}} and adopted as Christian Fleur-de-lis. This development {{was supported by}} Wynfryth of Wessex, since <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> the official use of the White-Red (Brahmini-Kšatriya) flags and the ancient Sudaršana Čakra (Wheel of Perun-Parjanya-Indra-Taranis-IX, now known as Wheel of Mainz) was no more sanctioned by Germanic invaders. Nevertheless, until around 777 the remaining Veneti-Boii-Slavs of Boio-aria (Bavaria), now invaded and settled by Germans, were enslaved by Tassilo III. Their ancient (Kopa/Hallstatt and La Tène) industries along their castles were acquired by Germanic invaders. The use of a triple Fleur-de-lis is basically a modified representation of the ancient Triskelion.|$|E
25|$|Biggs was {{a teacher}} and a farmer, <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> was {{primarily}} spent tending peach orchards in central New Castle County and the adjacent portion of Maryland. However, {{he was also a}} talented public speaker, and through this avocation, began a lifelong involvement in public affairs. Beginning {{as a member of the}} Whig Party, he was an instrumental figure in the Delaware Constitutional Convention of 1852. While the work of this convention was ultimately rejected, Biggs switched his partisan allegiance to the Democratic Party when the Whig Party broke up. The Democrats were the Southern leaning, anti-abolitionist, states rights party, strongly opposed to the policies of Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans. Presumably Biggs was in general agreement with its positions.|$|E
25|$|Board {{began the}} 1968 season {{by winning the}} 440 yard race at an inter-club meeting in Brighton, her time of 54.8 comfortably inside the Olympic {{qualifying}} standard. She then leapt {{to the top of}} the world rankings after winning over 400 m (53.5) at an international meeting in Moscow. However, at the Women's AAA championships in July, she spurned the chance of an almost certain victory in the 400 m and instead decided to contest the 800 metres. After winning her heat (2.05.7), she showed her huge potential in this event by running a superb 2:02.0 (the second fastest ever by a British woman), to finish 2nd to the reigning European 800 m champion, Vera Nikolic of Yugoslavia, <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> of 2:00.5 was a new world record.|$|E

25|$|The closest {{examples}} to a true air invasion are the Battle of Crete, Operation Thursday (the Chindits second operation during the Burma Campaign) and Operation Market Garden. The latter was {{an assault on}} the German-occupied Netherlands conducted in September 1944. Nearly 35,000 men were dropped by parachute and glider into enemy territory in an attempt to capture bridges from the Germans and make way for the Allies' advance. However, even with such a massive force taking the Germans completely by surprise, the assault was a tactical failure and after 9 days of fighting the Allies managed only to escape back to their own lines, having sustained over 18,000 casualties. In the 21st century, as vast improvements are made in anti-aircraft defenses, it seems that the air invasion is a strategy <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> may never come.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{relatively}} uneventful postings at {{home and}} abroad were punctuated with periods of active service. Both the 28th and the 61st Regiments fought against Napoleon in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War. The 28th Regiment also participated in the final defeat of Napoleon, being commended by the Duke of Wellington for gallantry in the Battle of Quatre Bras, and seeing action again in the Battle of Waterloo. In the mid-19th century both regiments were deployed to India, with the 61st Regiment seeing active service during the Second Anglo-Sikh War and the Indian Mutiny, resulting in the addition of 'Chillianwallah', 'Goojerat', 'Punjaub', and 'Delhi 1857' to the list of battle honours that the Gloucestershire Regiment would soon inherit. The 28th Regiment, <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> in India was shorter and less eventful, was meanwhile deployed to the Crimea, adding 'Alma', 'Inkerman', and 'Sevastopol' to its legacy.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 the National Bureau of Standards {{completed}} a three-year {{study of the}} impact of increasing worldwide metric use on the U.S. The study concluded with a report to Congress entitled A Metric America– A Decision <b>Whose</b> <b>Time</b> Has Come. Since then metric use has increased in the U.S., principally in the manufacturing and educational sectors. Public Law 93-380, enacted 21 August 1974, states that it is the policy of the U.S. to encourage educational agencies and institutions to prepare students to use the metric system of measurement with ease and facility {{as a part of the}} regular education program. On 23 December 1975, President Gerald Ford signed Public Law 94-168, the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. This act declares a national policy of coordinating the increasing use of the metric system in the U.S. It established a U.S. Metric Board whose functions as of 1 October 1982 were transferred to the Dept of Commerce, Office of Metric Programs, to coordinate the voluntary conversion to the metric system.|$|E
