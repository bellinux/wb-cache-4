The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that <b>will</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> able to claim the body.|$|E

25|$|Generally, when {{an inmate}} {{arrives at a}} prison, they go through a {{security}} classification screening and risk assessment that determines {{where they will be}} placed within the prison system. Classifications are assigned by assessing the prisoner's personal history and criminal record, and through subjective determinations made by intake personnel (which include mental health workers, counselors, prison unit managers, and others). This process will {{have a major impact on}} the prisoner's experience, determining their security level, educational and work programs, mental health status (e.g. <b>will</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> placed in a mental health unit), and many other factors. This sorting of prisoners is one of the fundamental techniques through which the prison administration maintains control over the inmate population, and creates an orderly and secure prison environment. At most prisons, prisoners are made to wear prison uniform.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016 {{there is}} no commercially {{available}} vaccine that is effective for hantavirus. A vaccine known as Hantavax has been under study since 1990. As of 2016, the development is in clinical phase 3 trial stage. This inactivated vaccine is thought not to be effective against European hantaviruses like the Puumala (PUUV) virus. There is no FDA approved vaccine available and a killed-virus vaccine is not being pursued because of the dangers associated with mass production under high containment {{as well as the}} unresolved questions about the efficiency of the vaccine. However, a number of labs have been working towards a vaccine that would deliver viral antigens by either DNA vectors or as recombinant proteins. While these recombinant vaccines are being developed they are not currently available nor <b>will</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> in the near future.|$|E

Hook remembers the Apprentice from when he and Gold trapped him in the sorcerer's hat.

(3) How will parents respond to the treatment of such a sensitive topic? and (4) Will children be disturbed by the messages, and if so, for how long? [...] The researchers broke up children into three groups: children who only watched the scenes in which the storyline was played out and who were interviewed afterwards; children who watched the entire episode and whose attention was recorded while they viewed it; and children who watched the episode without the inserts, with their parents, who were interviewed 9 or 10 days later.|$|E

Amnesty International similarly condemned the government crackdown and asked for an independent investigation into the events. Anonymous, an online hackers grouping, issued a statement condemning the crackdown and expressed its solidarity with the protesters: [...] "By interfering with the freedom to hold peaceful protests, the Bahrainian [...] government has made itself a clear enemy of its own citizens and of Anonymous.

2500|$|Although this {{profession}} {{is seen as}} a frivolous one, nat-kadaws are in fact very religious.

[...] Oftentimes [...] a nat-kadaw can become tormented by a specific nat. Even if they already have a human husband or wife, they decide that they must marry this nat, for only then <b>will</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> at peace, and the torment that this nat is causing them will finally cease. The marriage of a nat and a nat-kadaw is done through an extremely elaborate ceremony titled Ley-Bya-Taik. In this ceremony, the nat-kadaw identifies the particular nat {{that they would like to}} marry, and then surrenders to it. In this process mirrors are used to trap the soul (mentioned earlier) that leaves the host. Once this soul has left, the nat takes the place of it. After this transformation is complete, the nat-kadaw dances, embracing their recent marriage with a nat.|$|E

[...] One manifestation of this obedience was constant hard labour designed to subdue the flesh, exercise the will in daily self-denial, and set an example of industry in cultivation of the soil. The least deviation from the Rule entailed corporal punishment, or a severe form of fasting. In the second chapter, Columbanus instructs that the rule of silence be [...] "carefully observed", since it is written: [...] "But the nurture of righteousness is silence and peace". He also warns, [...] "Justly <b>will</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> damned who would not say just things when they could, but preferred to say with garrulous loquacity what is evil ..."
