Culture has interpreted, compartmentalized, or rationalized this process {{in such a way as}} to prevent a holistic relationship with the earth and with ourselves.   Creative processes in which we work [...] painting, literature, and photography [...] are not that dissimilar to the creative life processes in which we are immersed and those that surround us. Death as a creative process is a necessary step toward regeneration and renewal. I approach my photographic subjects with the understanding that these images of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>are</b> also in the midst of a creative process.   I utilized the method of series or sequence - to hold the moment in the death-life process, a moment that needed to be suspended, so one could look at it with more than one glance, have the time to look into time and change, to study its movement and its confusion and beauty - so that the effect of an image captured in a series on the observer would hold a more lasting, fluid impression.   I photograph common animals encountered in ordinary small town life; animals one might see by the side of the road, a domesticated dog killed by a car, a neighborhood cat, a discarded catfish caught in a nearby river and left behind, a mourning dove that has broken its neck, a deer in season killed by local hunters, a feral fox killed on the highway. These subjects are currently part of a human being's conscious and unconscious awareness of the animal world in a typical small town. They may be a part but not a necessary part of the human world (excluding the emotional relationship between pet owner and pet); that is, they are elements of the world viewed from an unaffected distance.   "The Return" recognizes the possibility to recreate visions of the natural world that are more harmonious and less compartmentalized, more wholesome, less segmented, and avoid the segregation of "diseased" versus "healthy," "polluted" versus "unpolluted," or "dead" versus "living," In some small way, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aiming to encourage a view of the natural world that sees value and beauty in all of its processes.   M.

We use minimal cases of structure-from-motion for hy-pothesis generation in a RANSAC engine. For this purpose, several new and useful minimal cases are derived for cali-brated, semi-calibrated and uncalibrated settings.

6000|$|Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> many a {{year before}} I found out that, and I dare say I never should have found it out for myself. A gentleman named Trimmer, who, alas! is now dead, <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> believe, the first to find it out. He knew that {{along the coast of}} Labrador, and other cold parts of North America, and on the shores, too, of the great river St. Lawrence, the {{stranded}} icebergs, and the ice-foot, as it is called, which is continually forming along the freezing shores, grub and plough every tide into the mud and sand, and shove up before them, like a ploughshare, heaps of dirt; and that, too, the ice itself is full of dirt, of sand and stones, which it may have brought from hundreds of miles away; and that, as this ploughshare of dirty ice grubs onward, the nose of the plough is continually being broken off, and left underneath the mud; and that, when summer comes, and the ice melts, the mud falls back into the place where the ice had been, and covers up the gravel which was in the ice. So, what between the grubbing of the ice-plough into the mud, and the dirt which it leaves behind when it melts, the stones, and sand, and mud upon the shore are jumbled up into curious curved and twisted layers, exactly like those which Mr. Trimmer saw in certain gravel-pits. And when I first read about that, I said, [...] "And exactly like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> in every gravel-pit round here, and trying to guess how they could have been made by currents of water, and yet never could make any guess which would do."

6000|$|I {{should tell}} him {{the thing that was}} {{becoming}} more and more apparent in my own mind. Here, <b>I</b> should say, <b>is</b> a world, obviously {{on the face of it}} well organised. Compared with our world, it is like a well-oiled engine beside a scrap-heap. It has even got this confounded visual organ swivelling about in the most alert and lively fashion. But that's by the way.... You have only to look at all these houses below. (We should be sitting on a seat on the Gutsch and looking down on the Lucerne of Utopia, a Lucerne that would, I insist, quite arbitrarily, still keep the Wasserthurm and the Kapellbrucke.) You have only to mark the beauty, the simple cleanliness and balance of this world, you have only to see the free carriage, the unaffected graciousness of even the common people, to understand how fine and complete the arrangements of this world must be. How are they made so? We of the twentieth century are not going to accept the sweetish, faintly nasty slops of Rousseauism that so gratified our great-great-grandparents in the eighteenth. We know that order and justice do not come by Nature--"if only the policeman would go away." [...] These things mean intention, will, carried to a scale that our poor vacillating, hot and cold earth has never known. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> really <b>seeing</b> more and more clearly is the will beneath this visible Utopia. Convenient houses, admirable engineering that is no offence amidst natural beauties, beautiful bodies, and a universally gracious carriage, these are only the outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace. Such an order means discipline. It means triumph over the petty egotisms and vanities that keep men on our earth apart; it means devotion and a nobler hope; it cannot exist without a gigantic process of inquiry, trial, forethought and patience in an atmosphere of mutual trust and concession. Such a world as this Utopia is not made by the chance occasional co-operations of self-indulgent men, by autocratic rulers or by the bawling wisdom of the democratic leader. And an unrestricted competition for gain, an enlightened selfishness, that too fails us....|$|R
40|$|Cue: What kind of soil is {{good for}} growing crops? An obvious answer is a fertile soil, one that {{contains}} large quantities of the minerals and nutrients that plants need. It is also {{good to have a}} soil which can hold a lot of water. Soil with good water holding capacity can sustain plants for longer during dry spells, thereby saving crops that might otherwise dry up and die. Adding organic matter to the soil, such as compost or animal manure, improves the quality of the soil in both ways. It increases nutrient levels and also increases the water holding capacity. It also gives the soil a better structure, by creating larger spaces between the soil particles. This improves the infiltration of rainwater, and gives the plant roots the air that they need to function. Mathias Ngong is a banana farmer in the village of Babungo in Cameroon?s North West province. He is also an expert on using organic manure. Martha Chindong asked him what he had learned about applying compost and animal dung from his many years of farming. IN:		?Can you just tell us the methods ?? OUT:		??have your manure without straining. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mathias Ngong, a banana farmer from Cameroon?s North West province, explaining to Martha Chindong about the value of manure and compost to boost the water holding capacity of the soil, and improve his harvests of bananas. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Chindong	Can you just tell us the methods, better ways of applying organic manure? Ngong	Yes first of all to make organic manure is simple. You get all this grass that we clear from the compound, get some wood ash, get soil, put it underneath. If you have some cow dung or any dung, put it on it and then you put your grass, just drop a bit of water and allow it there. It is good to do it before the rainy season and then when water drops on it, it gets rotten. It gives you very good compost manure which you can use. Anybody can do that very easily. Then for those who have the dung, either goat droppings, fowl droppings, cow dung, those are good manures too that you can use, but with this one you must allow it for sometime. You know before you apply on the plant you allow it to decompose. The heat will come out and then it will be soft, you will not damage the plant. Now even with the bananas you see, when I want to plant banana I dig the hole, sizeable - about 60 centimetres wide and 60 deep, put the compost manure which you have prepared, put it under, fine, mix it with soil, surface soil. The soil right deep under, take it away because that one has no use. The surface soil, mix it and then you plant your suckers and some people use very tall suckers to plant, this is not good. You plant suckers which have no leaves yet, sometimes very little suckers, put them, bury them in the ground, let them disappear and let them come out by themselves. Then when they come out the results will be very good. Chindong	Can you just tell us the methods, better ways of applying organic manure? Ngong	Well you get under the plants, soften the soil, you soften the soil around it then get the manure, put it round the plant. As water is entering it is sinking into the soil, it will help the roots of the plant to gain food and it will grow very well. Then to protect it from sunlight, if you are a farmer you must prepare some of these things. When you clear your grass do not throw, pack it somewhere. This grass you will use to what we locally call you give the VIP treatment to the plant. Chindong	That is mulching? Ngong	Yes mulching, you mulch the plant now with grass so that the soil under the plant remains moist, wet. The sun will be there quite alright but you find the plant fresh because the underneath is soft and the grass prevents sun from heating directly into the soil to burn the roots and make it weak and dry up the water. That is how you can give some VIP treatment to your plant. Chindong	That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> in front of us? Ngong	That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done here, as you can see. If you like I can open the soil and you see, down there. Once in a while, if you planted vegetables and so on this hand fork is very important. You loosen the soil with it like this, soften it round. You are not damaging the roots but you are giving room for air to get into the soil, because if it is harder, you have been throwing water the surface is hard, the plant will not grow. You soften it once in a while. You know if you are a farmer you must devote time. You soften it as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing this one like this, when you soften, soften, it gives room for water to penetrate easily and air, because air gets into the soil too. It will help your plant to pick up. Chindong	Ok if you want to broadcast, say you want to plant on a large surface, can you carry the manure like what we <b>are</b> <b>seeing,</b> in this bucket, and throw on the ridge before you hoe it? <b>Is</b> it necessary, <b>is</b> it important? Ngong	Yes, it is important. If you have the cow dung in large quantities you soften the soil, throw the manure in it and at the time you are forming the ridges the manure is just getting into those ridges ? that is, after you have dug the place put your manure. Then when you are forming the ridges the manure is already getting into the soil. It makes the whole place, even if it was barren it would be now rich for planting. Chindong	The only thing is that to have a large quantity of it is difficult too? Ngong	Well, many more farmers are understanding now the use of organic manure so the rush for it is high. So it is also advisable to do what we call mixed farming, because you had 3, 4, 5 pigs and some poultry around, you always have your manure without straining. End of trackAdding compost and farmyard manure to soil both increases fertility and soil health, and improves the water holding content...|$|R
