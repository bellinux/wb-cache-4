50|$|The Sahariyas are expert woodsmen {{and forest}} product gatherers. They are {{particularly}} skilled in making catechu from Khair trees. The main business is gathering & selling of forest <b>wood,</b> <b>gum,</b> tendu leaf, honey, mahua and medicinal herbs. Their traditional occupations also include making baskets, mining and quarrying, and breaking stones. They also hunt and fish. Some Sahariyas are settled cultivators. Wheat, pearl millet and maize {{are the main}} cereal crops. Gram and arhar are the main pulses. Agriculture is largely rain-dependent with merely 2% of the total land area being irrigated. The main sources of irrigation are wells and rivulets, which are seasonal. Others are landless labourers who were earlier bonded labourers.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Hammer district, Southern Ethiopia, to provide empirical evidence on economic contribution to local livelihoods and households dependency on dry forest products. One agropastoral and two pastoral kebeles were purposively selected, and data was collected through household survey, group discussions, market assessments, and field observation. A total of 164 households, selected based on a random sampling procedure, were interviewed using structured questionnaire. The study found that income from forest products contributes 21. 4 % of the total annual household income. The major dry forest products include honey, fuel <b>wood,</b> <b>gum</b> and resin, and crafts and construction materials, contributing 49 %, 39 %, 6 %, and 6 % of the forest income, respectively. Households of the pastoral site earned more forest income and were relatively more dependent on forest products income than those in the agropastoral study site. Significant variation was also found among income groups: households with higher total annual income obtain more forest income than those with lower income, but they are relatively less dependent on forest products than the lower counterpart. Besides, various socioeconomic and contextual factors were found to influence forest income and dependency. The findings of the study provide valuable information up on which important implications for dry land forest development and management strategies can be drawn...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Emissions of {{greenhouse}} gases mostly from fossil fuels are responsible for global warming and climatic changes. This has led to research in bioenergy to reduce greenhouse emissions because bioenergy {{is part of the}} carbon cycle, and can only emit greenhouse gases {{that are part of the}} carbon cycle. The drawback is its low calorific value when it is in its raw form. Torrefaction improves its energy content to values that are comparable to coal. In this study, marula seeds and blue <b>gum</b> <b>wood,</b> two of South Africa most abundant biomass, were blended with coal both raw and torrefied to see the impact of the torrefaction process on energy density. Blending was done at different ratios to see the optimum results. Results showed that highest calorific value was obtained at 100 % marula seeds and 0 % coal, and it was recommended for further studies. Blue <b>gum</b> <b>wood</b> due to its high moisture had slightly higher heating value than the reference coal but from an economical point of view it was not attractive for further studies. This showed the significance of the torrefaction process in increasing heating value of selected biomass in the hope of reducing effects {{of greenhouse}} gas emissions...|$|R

So, improving the classification and mapping accuracy of forest in surrounding coastal regions is essential for the restoration and management decisions. The first objective of this thesis is to use segmented Principal Component (PC) images to classify the ground features including different tree species and to improve the classification results.

The results showed common fire retardation {{actions of the}} three compounds by releasing incombustible gas and/or water vapor to dilute combustible gas in the flaming zone, and by converting to MgO, which had a satisfactory protective wall effect on the wood. Individually, BMC absorbed heat from the wood at the pre-decomposition stage and, thus, slowed down wood pyrolysis process. It slightly increased the char yield by charring in both the charring stage and the char calcination stage. MH lost water at about 270 °C, close to the temperature at which wood thermally degraded. MH rendered wood char quickly, and the compact char layer impeded further carbonization and burning of inner wood. MCH promoted charring with Mg 2 + as a Lewis acid, and increased wood char yield.

40|$|Examination of a {{large number}} of apple trees {{infected}} with Trametes versicolor, indicated that the fungus was a facultative parasite which caused a white rot of the sapwood. Papery bark was a distinctive but non-specific external symptom of the disease. The development of papery bark was influenced by seasonal and nutritional conditions and was not a reliable indicator of susceptibility of trees to T, versicolor. Discoloration of the sapwood always occurred in advance of fungal colonisation and decay. The formation of discolored wood involved the loss of starch and nuclei from ray and xylem parenchyma and the eventual necrosis of these cells. Necrotic cells were filled with a brown amorphous material which appeared to be oxidised phenolics. In young wood, ray and xylem parenchyma formed polysaccharide wound gum which was deposited in the vessels of the sapwood-discolored wood transition zone. The levels of K, Ca, Mg, moisture, pH, neutral solvent extractable materials and phenolics in discolored wood, differed from those in the adjacent sapwood. Bacteria were present in discolored wood in advance of the fungus. Discoloration was a non-specific response of the sapwood to mechanical or pethological stimuli. In vitro decay tests indicated that discolored wood was more resistant to decay than normal sapwood. Discoloration of the <b>wood</b> and <b>gum</b> formation therefore appeared to be an active host resistance mechanism to fungal penetration and decay. The host reaction to wounding was related to the physiological cycle of the tree and with age cells lost the ability to synthesise wound gum and reduced amounts of extraneous material were formed in the ray and xylem parenchyma. Evidence indicated that the resistance of young apple sapwood to colonisation and decay by T. versicolor was due to its vital nature and ability to elaborate an effective fungal inhibitory barrier. The susceptibility of living wood to fungal decay increased with age, due to a natural decline in host resistance...|$|R

The article presents methods of collecting raw datasets {{in the form of a}} point-cloud using a low-cost ground-based laser scanner FabScan. As part of the research work 3 D scanner from an open source FabLab project was constructed. In addition, the results for the analysis of the geometry of the point clouds obtained by using a low-cost laser scanner were presented. Also, some analysis of collecting data of different structures (made of various materials such as: glass, <b>wood,</b> paper, <b>gum,</b> plastic, plaster, ceramics, stoneware clay etc. and of different shapes: oval and similar to oval and prism shaped) have been done. The article presents two methods used for analysis: the first one - visual (general comparison between the 3 D model and the real object) and the second one - comparative method (comparison between measurements on models and scanned objects using the mean error of a single sample of observations). The analysis showed, that the low-budget ground-based laser scanner FabScan has difficulties with collecting data of non-oval objects. Items built of glass painted black also caused problems for the scanner. In addition, the more details scanned object contains, the lower the accuracy of the collected point-cloud is. Nevertheless, the accuracy of collected data (using oval-straight shaped objects) is satisfactory.

In this study we investigated the sorption of benzene and toluene in single-sorbate and bi-sorbate systems on different types of charcoals produced in laboratory, employing the batch sorption technique. Air dried plant materials from Phalaris grass (Phalaris tuberosa) and Red <b>Gum</b> <b>wood</b> (Eucalyptus camadulensis) were combusted under limited oxygen supply at 250 °C, 450 °C, and 850 °C. The resulting charcoals were characterized for their specific surface areas, total cation content, and pore size distributions (pore size distribution only for wood combusted at 450 °C and 850 °C). For the materials treated at 850 °C not only the surface area, microporosity, and total amount of sorbed sorbate increased markedly, but also the non-linearity of the sorption isotherm. The pore size distributions and surface areas {{as well as an}} indifferent sorption behaviour and competition effects for both sorbates indicated that pore filling mechanisms were the dominating processes governing the sorption on these microporous, high temperature treated materials. For the materials treated at lower temperatures the affinity of toluene was higher compared to that of benzene. In the bi-sorbate system the overall uptake of benzene increased. These phenomena might be due to the stronger hydrophobicity of toluene, and to a varying potential for swelling of the matrix and pore deformation by the two sorbates. The significantly lower sorption capacity of the Phalaris-derived material compared to the Red Gum charcoal correlated with its smaller surface area and higher cation content. Ludger C.

The influence of extractive removal is also studied and compared with the virgin wood samples. Measurements were performed at 9. 5 GHz for virgin wood samples and extractive-free wood samples. Experiments were carried out at room temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The dielectric properties of wood species were determined for three principle structural directions, (i. e. longitudinal tangential and radial) and different moisture contents. Moisture content varied from 0 % to 15 % for virgin wood samples and from 3 - 6. 6 % for extractive-free wood samples at atmospheric equilibrium condition. Results indicated that for both wood species the dielectric constant was affected by moisture content, structural direction and density. The dielectric properties of both wood species were found to be quantitatively similar. In general, for virgin wood samples the dielectric constant was found to increase with moisture content and density. The values of dielectric constant in the longitudinal direction were generally higher than those in the transverse direction for both types of wood species.

We monitored net primary production (NPP) and community respiration (CR), nutrient concentrations and the succession of algae and invertebrates (abundance and species richness), sampling at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks. Colonisation by algae was rapid, and there were distinct changes in the assemblages over the first 4 weeks. Thereafter, changes were much less marked. There were also differences in nutrient concentrations and some measures of algal abundance between the two creeks. As with the algae, invertebrates colonised these substrates extremely rapidly, peaking in abundance and richness in week 8. Invertebrate abundances closely tracked changes in the abundance of algae. By {{the end of the}} study both algal and invertebrate communities were in apparent decline, with sharp decreases in invertebrate and algal abundance and invertebrate species richness. Rates of GPP also declined toward the end of the experiment, and this coincided with the detachment of large mats of filamentous algae and the recession of flows over the summer months. However, in both streams the added timber quickly created habitat with high levels of primary production in an otherwise strongly heterotrophic stream system. These hotspots of autotrophic production were quickly colonised by high numbers of macroinvertebrates indicating timber addition may provide an effective means of augmenting habitat for algae and invertebrates in sanded streams.

40|$|Paenibacillus sp. strain JDR- 2, an aggressively xylanolytic {{bacterium}} {{isolated from}} decaying sweet <b>gum</b> <b>wood,</b> secretes a multimodular glycohydrolase family GH 10 endoxylanase (XynA 1) {{anchored to the}} cell surface. The gene encoding XynA 1 {{is part of a}} xylan utilization regulon that includes an aldouronate utilization gene cluster with genes encoding a GH 67 α-glucuronidase (AguA), a GH 10 endoxylanase (XynA 2), and a GH 43 arabinofuranosidase/β-xylosidase (XynB). Here we show that this Paenibacillus sp. strain is able to utilize methylglucuronoxylose (MeGAX 1), an aldobiuronate product that accumulates during acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, and methylglucuronoxylotriose (MeGAX 3), the product of the extracellular XynA 1 acting on methylglucuronoxylan (MeGAXn). The average rates of utilization of MeGAXn, MeGAX 1, and MeGAX 3 were 149. 8, 59. 4, and 54. 3 μg xylose equivalents·ml− 1 ·h− 1, respectively, and were proportional to the specific growth rates on the substrates. AguA was active with MeGAX 1 and MeGAX 3, releasing 4 -O-methyl-d-glucuronate α- 1, 2 linked to a nonreducing terminal xylose residue. XynA 2 converted xylotriose, generated by the action of AguA on MeGAX 3, to xylose and xylobiose. The ability to utilize MeGAX 1 provides a novel metabolic potential for bioconversion of acid hydrolysates of lignocellulosics. The 2. 8 -fold-greater rate of utilization of polymeric MeGAXn than that of MeGAX 3 indicates that there is coupling of extracellular depolymerization, assimilation, and intracellular metabolism, allowing utilization of lignocellulosics with minimal pretreatment. Along with adjacent genes encoding transcriptional regulators and ABC transporter proteins, the aguA and xynA 2 genes in the cluster described above contribute to the efficient utilization of aldouronates derived from dilute acid and/or enzyme pretreatment protocols applied to the conversion of hemicellulose to biofuels and chemicals...|$|R
6000|$|HALF the world, it is said, knows not how {{the other}} half live. Our Exploring Expedition saw the Feejee islanders getting their dinner off human bones; and {{they are said to}} eat their own wives and children. The {{husbandry}} of the modern inhabitants of Gournou (west of old Thebes) is philosophical to a fault. To set up their housekeeping nothing is requisite but two or three earthen pots, a stone to grind meal, and a mat which is the bed. The house, namely a tomb, is ready without rent or taxes. No rain can pass through the roof, and there is no door, for there is no want of one, as there is nothing to lose. If the house do not please them, they walk out and enter another, as there are several hundreds at their command. [...] "It is somewhat singular," [...] adds Belzoni, to whom we owe this account, [...] "to talk of happiness among people who live in sepulchres, among the corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they know nothing of." [...] In the deserts of Borgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell in caves, like cliff-swallows, and the language of these negroes is compared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats and to the whistling of birds. Again, the Bornoos have no proper names; individuals are called after their height, thickness, or other accidental quality, and have nicknames merely. But the salt, the dates, the ivory, and the gold, for which these horrible regions are visited, find their way into countries where the purchaser and consumer can hardly be ranked in one race with these cannibals and man-stealers; countries where man serves himself with metals, <b>wood,</b> stone, glass, <b>gum,</b> cotton, silk, and wool; honors himself with architecture; writes laws, and contrives to execute his will through the hands of many nations; and, especially, establishes a select society, running through all the countries of intelligent men, a self-constituted aristocracy, or fraternity of the best, which, without written law or exact usage of any kind, perpetuates itself, colonizes every new-planted island and adopts and makes its own whatever personal beauty or extraordinary native endowment anywhere appears.|$|R
