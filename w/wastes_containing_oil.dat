40|$|Abstract. Lipids {{constitute}} one of {{the major}} types of organic matter found in municipal wastewater. Many manufacturing, food processing and industrial facilities dispose of liquid waste into sewer lines. Liquid <b>waste</b> often <b>contains</b> fats, <b>oils</b> and grease and other organic contaminants which, over time, lead to clogs in pipes. The treatment of this problem is to clean pipes with caustic drain cleaners, mechanically rout the pipes or to replace the pipes completely. The second problem was the utilization of solid waste. JSC “Biocentras ” suggest a very effective and innovative complex technology. Firstly, lipids from wastewater and from drain pipes surfaces are removing mechanically. Remained lipids and solid wastes were treated with a composition of active microorganisms. The novel composition is nonpoisonous, no corrosive, no caustic and ecologically advantageous. The invented technology ensures maximum results at the lowest cost in the shortest period of time...|$|R
40|$|Amylases and lipases {{are highly}} demanded {{industrial}} enzymes in various sectors such as food, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and detergents. Amylases are of ubiquitous occurrence {{and hold the}} maximum market share of enzyme sales. Lipases are the most versatile biocatalyst and bring about a range of bioconversion reactions such as hydrolysis, inter-esterification, esterification, alcoholysis, acidolysis, and aminolysis. The objective of this work was to study the feasibility for amylolitic and lipolytic production using a bacterium strain isolated from petroleum contaminated soil in the same submerged fermentation. This was a sequential process based on starch and vegetable oils feedstocks. Run were performed in batchwise using 2 % starch supplemented with suitable nutrients and different vegetable oils as a lipase inducers. Fermentation conditions were pH 5. 0; 30 degrees C, and stirred speed (200 rpm). Maxima activities for amyloglucosidase and lipase were, respectively, 0. 18 and 1, 150 U/ml.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{increasing}} {{value of}} pure vegetable oils {{has made the}} use of waste cooking oils an attractive alternative feedstock for biodiesel production but the presence of free fatty acids in the waste significantly reduces efficiency of the conversion. RESULTS A low-temperature mixed ionic liquid system with dual extraction and catalytic functions for the conversion of <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> <b>containing</b> high levels of free fatty acids to biodiesel was successfully trialled. The solvent, a totally miscible system of HPyrBr and the Brønsted acid, SPyrHSO 4, allows the key properties of each ionic liquid, as extractant or catalyst, to work uninhibited {{by the presence of}} the other. Extraction of free fatty acids from vegetable oils and their conversion to methyl esters in high yield is demonstrated for vegetable <b>oils,</b> <b>containing</b> single and mixed fatty acids, and for a model waste cooking oil. The oil separated from free fatty acids in the waste has a low acid value and can be converted efficiently to biodiesel; with the ionic liquid solvent recovered unchanged for reuse. CONCLUSIONS A mixed ionic liquid extraction-esterification solvent process has been developed to effect efficient conversion of free fatty acids in waste vegetable oils to biodiesel and their conversion to esters...|$|R
50|$|Independent Petrochemical Corporation (IPC), was {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of Charter Oil. On several occasions, {{and as a}} courtesy to a customer, IPC arranged for the disposal of waste oil by a St. Louis waste oil hauler, Bliss Oil, {{with the understanding that}} Bliss would take the oil to a waste disposal site. In actuality, after Bliss Oil's president tasted the oil to check its suitability for other uses and found the flavor fit, Bliss sprayed it as a dust suppressant at various locations throughout Missouri. The sprayings occurred over a period of at least two months, with each spraying lasting about 30-40 minutes. The <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> <b>contained</b> dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, chemical compounds that were known carcinogens. The discharge of the dioxin-contaminated oil was the basis of claims against IPC by the federal government, the State of Missouri, and over 1,600 private plaintiffs. The private suits sought an aggregate $4 billion in compensatory damages and an identical amount in punitive damages. IPC entered into settlements covering all of the claims which included over $100 million owed to the federal government for clean-up of various sites in Missouri.|$|R
40|$|Cost of {{biodiesel}} {{produced from}} virgin vegetable oil through transesterification {{is higher than}} that of fossil fuel, because of high raw material cost. To minimize the biofuel cost, in recent days waste cooking oil was used as feedstock. Catalysts used in this process are usually acids, base, and lipase. Since lipase catalysts are much expensive, the usage of lipase in biodiesel production is limited. In most cases, NaOH is used as alkaline catalyst, because of its low cost and higher reaction rate. In the case of <b>waste</b> cooking <b>oil</b> <b>containing</b> high percentage of free fatty acid, alkaline catalyst reacts with free fatty acid and forms soap by saponification reaction. Also, it reduces the biodiesel conversions. In order to reduce the level of fatty acid content, waste cooking oil is pretreated with acid catalyst to undergo esterification reaction, which also requires high operating conditions. In this review paper, various parameters influencing the process of biofuel production such as reaction rate, catalyst concentration, temperature, stirrer speed, catalyst type, alcohol used, alcohol to oil ratio, free fatty acid content, and water content have been summarized...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the conceptual {{design of a}} production process in which waste cooking oil is converted via supercritical transesterification with methanol to methyl esters (biodiesel). Since <b>waste</b> cooking <b>oil</b> <b>contains</b> water and free fatty acids, supercritical transesterification offers great advantage to eliminate the pre-treatment capital and operating cost. A supercritical transesterification process for biodiesel continuous production from waste cooking oil has been studied for three plant capacities (125, 000; 80, 000 and 8000 tonnes biodiesel/year). It can be concluded that biodiesel by supercritical transesterification can be scaled up resulting high purity of methyl esters (99. 8 %) and almost pure glycerol (96. 4 %) attained as by-product. The economic assessment of the biodiesel plant shows that biodiesel can be sold at US$ 0. 17 /l (125, 000 tonnes/year), US$ 0. 24 /l (80, 000 tonnes/year) and US$ 0. 52 /l for the smallest capacity (8000 tonnes/year). The sensitive key factors for the economic feasibility of the plant are: raw material price, plant capacity, glycerol price and capital cost. Overall conclusion is that the process can compete with the existing alkali and acid catalyzed processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Waste pollutions and {{disposal}} problems of transformer substation in electric power industry were paid {{more and more}} attention by people. <b>Waste</b> transformer <b>oil</b> <b>contained</b> many kinds of toxic substances. Transformer oil belongs to hazardous waste according {{to the definition of}} the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the National Hazardous Waste Inventory in China. The related research on environmental pollutants in waste transformer oil was less. The composition and content of particular pollutants which is harmful to human health and ecological environment in waste transformer oil was studied in this paper. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was chosen to detect the organic pollution composition and content of particular pollutants in transformer oil, based on investigation and analysis. Transformer oil samples running different time under 10 KV voltage level were detected. The test results showed that with turbidity of oil rising, the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in waste transformer oil increased, while benzene content changed in the opposite trend. Complex composition, different origin and different operating conditions were the reasons of difficulty to separate organic components in transformer oil during detection. This study is helpful for safe disposal of waste transformer oil. And it also can provide some theoretical support to eliminate the harm of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene series...|$|R

Studies are conducted on the reclamation of metals, rejuvenation and reuse of the spent hydrotreating catalyst (Mo–Ni/Al) which have been used in re-refining of waste lube oil at Alexandria Petroleum Company. Three leaching solvents were used: oxidized oxalic acid, benzoic acid and boric acid at different concentrations (4 %, 8 % and 16 %), different oxidizing agents (H 2 O 2 and Fe(NO 3) 3) and different modes of addition of oxidizing agents (batch and continuous). The results indicated that 4 % oxalic acid+ 5 % Fe(NO 3) 3 at continuous addition of oxidizing agents was the most efficient leaching solvent to facilitate metal removal and rejuvenate catalyst. The fresh catalyst was applied for re-refining of waste lube oil under different reaction temperatures (320 – 410) °C in order to compare the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) activity with both the fresh, treated and spent catalysts.
