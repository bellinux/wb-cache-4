Usually, more metal is added to the puddle as it is moved along by dipping metal from a welding rod or filler rod into the molten metal puddle. The metal puddle will travel towards where the metal is the hottest. This is {{accomplished}} through torch manipulation by the welder.|$|E
500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. [...] Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} a defect inspection of an arc <b>welded</b> <b>bead</b> using a support vector machine (SVM) and a neural network (NN). In our approach, these classifiers are trained to classify arc <b>welded</b> <b>beads</b> as a non-defect class or a defect class. We use intensity, frequency and edge features extracted from arc <b>welded</b> <b>bead</b> images. After extracting these features, principal component analysis (PCA) is used {{to reduce the number}} of dimensions of the extracted features. PCA is a statistical tool, which is useful to extract dominant features from a set of multivariate data. Experiments show that both the SVM and the NN have over 91 % detection rate for the non-defect and over 82 % detection rate for the defect.

50|$|Longitudinal cracks {{run along}} the length of a <b>weld</b> <b>bead.</b> There are three types: check cracks, root cracks, and full {{centerline}} cracks. Check cracks are visible from the surface and extend partially into the weld. They are usually caused by high shrinkage stresses, especially on final passes, or by a hot cracking mechanism. Root cracks start at the root and extent part way into the weld. They are {{the most common type of}} longitudinal crack because of the small size of the first <b>weld</b> <b>bead.</b> If this type of crack is not addressed then it will usually propagate into subsequent weld passes, which is how full cracks (a crack from the root to the surface) usually form.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} CO 2 {{laser beam}} welding of two aluminum metal matrix composites (6061 and 2618 reinforced with 20 % of Al 2 O 3) has been investigated with {{special attention to the}} influence of the base alloys, the filler material and the process parameters on the microstructure of the <b>welding</b> <b>bead.</b> In this work square butt welding has been obtained with different CO 2 laser power, feed rate and shielding gases. The microstructure of the <b>welding</b> <b>beads</b> has been examined by optical and electronic microscopy. A migration of the Al 2 O 3 reinforcement particles from the fusion zone (FZ) towards the heat affected zone (HAZ) has been detected and the particles agglomerate near the interface FZ-HAZ. An increase in both porosity and agglomerate sizes inside the <b>welding</b> <b>bead</b> has been observed as the feed rate has been reduced. The hardness of <b>welding</b> <b>beads</b> has been higher than the unaffected composites. A reduction of both the beads hardness and the Al 2 O 3 migration and agglomeration has been obtained by the use of magnesium-rich filler material in the welding process, probably because magnesium is able to increase the reinforcement wettability, and to reduce the rate of formation of spinel phase MgAl 2 O 4. The use of Ar as shielding gas was the most effective, both {{in order to avoid the}} development of porosity and to reduce the Al 2 O 3 agglomeration...|$|R

40|$|Welding {{is widely}} used in {{industry}} for products made of joined sheet metal parts and beams. The virtual prototyping process of welds in standard CAD systems relies on functionalities to manually add <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> to the assembly models. <b>Weld</b> <b>beads</b> {{can be in the}} form of symbolic annotations or 3 D solid representations. The size of products in terms of number of parts and required <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> makes this process cumbersome and time consuming. This paper presents a method to analyze CAD models of product assemblies in order to automatically identify possible welds among the parts using geometric recognition rules. Adjacent faces are detected and Boolean operators on planar loops are used to identify bead paths. Beads are then split in homogeneous portions based on the topology of the connected parts. The geometrical analysis of the connected parts also allows a bead to be characterized in terms of thickness, type, length and accessibility. Finally, the user is provided with functionalities to edit manufacturing properties or exclude unwanted welds. The approach is applied at the design stage to rapidly come to the definition of the welds. If integrated with a CAD tool, this can be used as input for an efficient detailing phase. Moreover, the paper presents an application for the cost estimation of the designed <b>welded</b> product. <b>Weld</b> <b>beads</b> are given a realization time, and hence a cost, based on their geometric size and employed welding technology. Some examples from the industry are presented to show benefits in terms of time savings and accuracy of the cost estimation process. Copyright ?????? 2012 by ASME...|$|R
50|$|Voltage {{control is}} {{required}} in contour welding. In normal key hole welding a variation in arc length up to 1.5 mm does not affect <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> penetration or bead shape to any significant extent and thus a voltage control is not considered essential.|$|E
50|$|When {{welding with}} metals such as Titanium, a {{secondary}} inert shielding gas application {{is necessary to}} protect the cooling <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> and heat-affected zone.

50|$|When a pipe is welded or bent {{the most}} common method to inspect blockages, misalignment, ovality, and <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> {{dimensional}} conformity is to pass a round ball through the pipe coil or circuit. If the inner pipe dimension is to be measured then the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> should be subtracted, if welding is applicable. Typically, the clearance tolerance for the ball must not exceed 1 mm. Allowable ovality of any pipe is measured on the inside dimension of the pipe, normally 5% to 10% ovality can be accepted. If no other test is conducted to verify ovality, or blockages, this test {{must be seen as}} a standard requirement. A flow test can not be used in lieu of a blockage or ball test.

Failure of the welds occurred far from the <b>weld</b> <b>beads.</b> The electromagnetic stirring of the weld pool significantly reduced the levels of porosity in the <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> and favored columnar grain growth due to the ferromagnetic nature of the base metal and filler wire.

40|$|Welded joints form an {{integral}} part of steel constructions. Welded joints are undetachable joints, which are however subjects of corrosion processes. The internal energy increases during the fusion welding especially in the heat affected places around the welded joint, which become initiating spot of corrosion degradation. The aim of the experiment is to put a welded joint produced by the MAG method to a test of corrosion degradation under the conditions of the norm ČSN ISO 9227 (salt-spray test). Organic and inorganic anticorrosion protections were applied on <b>welded</b> <b>beads.</b> First of all, there were prepared <b>welded</b> <b>beads</b> using the method MAG; secondly, metallographical analyses of welded metal, heat affected places and base material were processed. Further, microhardness as well as analysis of chemical composition using the EDS microscope were analysed. Based on a current trend in anticorrosion protections, there were chosen three types of protective coatings. First protective system was a double-layer synthetic system, where the base layer is formed by paint Pragroprimer S 2000 and the upper layer by finishing paint Industrol S 2013. Second protective system is a duplex system formed by a combination of a base zinc coating with Zinorex paint. The last protective system was formed by zinc dipping only.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{inclusions}}: linear inclusions and rounded inclusions. Inclusions can be either isolated or cumulative. Linear inclusions occur when there is slag or flux in the weld. Slag forms from the use of a flux, which is why this type of defect usually occurs in welding processes that use flux, such as shielded metal arc welding, flux-cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding, but it can also occur in gas metal arc welding. This defect usually occurs in welds that require multiple passes and there is poor overlap between the welds. The poor overlap does not allow the slag from the previous weld to melt out and rise {{to the top of the}} new <b>weld</b> <b>bead.</b> It can also occur if the previous weld left an undercut or an uneven surface profile. To prevent slag inclusions the slag should be cleaned from the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> between passes via grinding, wire brushing, or chipping.|$|E
50|$|Lack of fusion is {{the poor}} {{adhesion}} of the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> {{to the base}} metal; incomplete penetration is a <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> that does not start {{at the root of}} the weld groove. Incomplete penetration forms channels and crevices in the root of the weld which can cause serious issues in pipes because corrosive substances can settle in these areas. These types of defects occur when the welding procedures are not adhered to; possible causes include the current setting, arc length, electrode angle, and electrode manipulation. Defects can be varied and classified as critical or non critical. Porosity (bubbles) in the weld are usually acceptable to a certain degree. Slag inclusions, undercut, and cracks are usually unacceptable. Some porosity, cracks, and slag inclusions are visible and may not need further inspection to require their removal. Small defects such as these can be verified by Liquid Penetrant Testing (Dye check). Slag inclusions and cracks just below the surface can be discovered by Magnetic Particle Inspection. Deeper defects can be detected using the Radiographic (X-rays) and/or Ultrasound (sound waves) testing techniques.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of laser welding {{technology has been}} considered to shipbuilding structure. However, when this technology is applied to primer-coated steel, good quality <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> are not easily obtained. Because the primer-coated layer caused the spatter, humping bead and porosity which are {{main part of the}} welding defect attributed to the powerful vaporizing pressure of zinc. So we performed experiment with objectives of understanding spatter and porosity formation mechanism and producing sound <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> in 6 t primer coated steels by a CO 2 CW laser. The effects of welding parameters; defocused distance, welding speed, coated thickness and coated position; were investigated in the bead shape and penetration depth on <b>bead</b> and lap <b>welding.</b> Alternative idea was suggested to suspend the welding defect by giving a reasonable gap clearance for primer coated thickness. The zinc of primer has a boiling point that is lower than melting point of steel. Zinc vapor builds up at the interface between the two sheets and this tends to deteriorate the quality of the weld by ejecting weld material from lap position or leaving porosity. Significant effects of primer coated position were lap side rather than surface. Therefore introducing a small gap clearance in the lap position, the zinc vapor could escape through it and sound <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> can be acquired. In conclusion, formation and suspension mechanism of the welding defects was suggested by controlling the factors...|$|R
