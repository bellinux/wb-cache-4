40|$|Background: The {{median age}} of {{patients}} in major Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) trials (MUSTT, MADIT-I, MADIT-II, and SCD-HeFT) was 63 - 67 years; with only 11 % ≥ 70 years. There is little follow-up data on patients over 70 years of age who received an ICD for primary/secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, particularly for veterans. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to study the natural history of ICD implantation for veterans over 70 years of age. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed single center ICD data in 216 patients with a mean age at implantation 76 ± 4 years. The ICD indication was primary prevention in 161 patients and secondary prevention in 55 patients. The ICD indication was unavailable in 4 patients. Results: Mean duration of follow up was 1686 ± 1244 days during which 114 (52 %) patients died. Of these, 31 % died without receiving any appropriate ICD therapy. Overall, 60 / 216 (28 %) received appropriate therapy and 28 / 216 (13 %) received inappropriate therapy. Patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ICD</b> implantation for secondary prophylaxis had statistically more (p= 0. 02) appropriate therapies compared to patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ICD</b> implantation for primary prevention. Indication for implantation and hypertension predicted appropriate therapy, while age at the time of implantation and presence of atrial fibrillation predicted inappropriate therapies. Overall, 7. 7 % had device related complications. Conclusions: Although 28 % septuagenarians in this study received appropriate ICD therapy, they had high rates of mortality, inappropriate therapy, and device complications. ICD implantation in the elderly merits individualized consideration, with higher benefit for secondary prevention...|$|E

The Belgian government is interested in delaying institutionalization of older persons. As a major predictor of institutionalization, IC’s burden is explored in this paper in order to identify its significant determinants. This is relevant information for home care providers to manage these determinants and try to decrease IC’s burden. Methods Nationwide, professional caregivers fill out the comprehensive geriatric assessment interRAI HomeCare and informal caregivers fill out the Zarit- 12 and an economic questionnaire. After descriptive statistics are calculated, the study population is stratified according to impairment levels (ADL, IADL and cognition). Multivariate analyses are performed to analyze significant associations.

40|$|Background: Recurrent therapies due to {{monomorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (VT) {{in patients with}} implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) can adversely affect their long-term survival. We intended to evaluate the long-term effect of the catheter ablation of electrical storm due to monomorphic VT in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Methods and Results: Between December 2006 and 2011, 40 consecutive patients (24 men, mean age 57. 9 ± 13. 6 years) with DCM and repeated monomorphic VT <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ICD</b> underwent 70 radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures, including 23 epicardial (33 %), at our center. After a median of 1. 5 ablations, acute complete success was achieved in 22 patients (63 %). During a mean follow-up of 820 days (range 238  2120 days) 29 patients (72. 5 %) were free from VT recurrence. Compared to those without acute complete success (n = 18), in those with acute complete success (n = 22), 20 (90. 9 %) and 9 (50 %) were free from any VT recurrence and ICD therapy, respectively (Fishers p = 0. 005). During follow-up 2 (9. 1 %) and 4 (22. 2 %) patients died in the above mentioned groups, respectively (p = 0. 267). Conclusion: Catheter ablation in DCM patients with electrical storm due to monomorphic VT prevents VT recurrence in 72. 5 % of the patients; however, many patients need more than one ablation procedure. Successful catheter ablation may play a protective role and {{was associated with a}} trend toward reduced mortality during the follow up period.

40|$|Introduction Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to improve survival in cardiac patients with high risk for sudden death. The incidence of ICD implantations is increasing worldwide. The cause and nature {{of death in the}} ICD population has been insufficiently investigated. In 2010 consensus statements were published to address and highlight the management of ICD patients who were nearing end of life. The overall aim of this thesis was to study patients with implantable defibrillator in end of life as well as physicians’ knowledge about ICD treatment and compliance to guidelines concerning ICD management. Methods and Results Study I: An observational study exploring intracardiac electrograms from 125 deceased ICD patients. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurred in 35 % of those patients during the last hour of their lives, and 31 % received shock treatment during the last 24 hours. 52 % of the patients had a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, but still had shock therapy active 24 hours before death in 65 % of cases. Study II: An observational analysis of 65 deceased ICD patients with DNR order. The majority (86 %) of patients were treated in hospitals, mainly (63 %) in university hospitals and (33 %) in Cardiology wards. Patients had active ICD therapy in 51 % of cases despite a DNR order, and 24 % of those patients experienced shocks as consequence. Patients with active ICD therapy had a median of 4 days (IQR 1 - 38) from decision of DNR to death. In the 38 % of the patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ICD</b> therapy deactivated, the deactivation was performed two days or more after the DNR decision. Study III: A cross-sectional comparative study with development of a questionnaire that was distributed among 432 physicians in 14 hospitals with a response rate of 99. 5 %. Many (83 %) of the physicians said they had experience with ICD patients and 68 % of physicians rated their ICD knowledge to be low. Sufficient knowledge regarding ICD therapy defined according to pre-specified criteria was observed in 41 %. Physicians in Cardiology departments scored significantly higher than others. Only 30 % of physicians in Internal Medicine and 19 % of physicians in Geriatrics reached sufficient knowledge compared with 71 % in Cardiology. Study IV: A comparison of two cohorts of ICD patients who died in hospitals before and after the implementation of new guidelines. Almost two-thirds of ICD patients in the two groups died in wards other than Cardiology. In group 1 patients had a DNR order in 54 % compared to 73 % in group 2. Shock deactivation was present in 52 % of the patients in group 1 compared to 67 % in group 2. The difference in deactivation rate between group 1 and 2 was only significant (p= 0. 016) for DNR patients treated in Cardiology. A significant difference (p= 0. 038) was also found in deactivation within group 2 between DNR patients treated in Cardiology vs. DNR patients in Non-Cardiology. Conclusions Patients with ICD dies in hospitals and the majority are treated in Non-Cardiology wards. Approximately one-third of patients with an ICD have ventricular tachyarrhythmia at end of life. Many patients have a DNR order but still have shock therapy active and thus receive unnecessary shocks before death. Deactivation rates have increased but not significantly since publications of international guidelines on the management of ICD in patients at end of life. Physicians in Cardiology, Internal Medicine, and Geriatrics have a lack of basic ICD knowledge, possibly affecting their ability to manage ICD patients and may increase the risk for unnecessary suffering for these patients at end of life...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to explore whether {{imaginary}} companions (ICs) in childhood might represent a social construction of childhood verbal hallucinations (VHs) which renders the experience socially acceptable. The objectives were to investigate: whether ICs amongst children occur at comparable rates to VHs among adults whether the phenomenology of ICs and VHs are similar whether adult ICs are perceived as less acceptable than childhood ICs. N = 1795 children aged five to twelve years, a random sample, were asked whether they <b>had</b> an <b>IC</b> and given measures of creativity. N = 70 randomly selected children <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ICs</b> were given structured interviews that were based mainly on previous adult hallucination studies. Lastly, a questionnaire in two formats was administered to two groups of N = 70 adults. The first group was asked to rate the acceptability of an adult having a conversation with an IC the second to do the same but for a child having a conversation with an IC. Key results were as follows prevalence of ICs in the study sample was approximately 50 %. Younger children <b>had</b> more <b>ICs</b> than older, more girls <b>had</b> <b>ICs.</b> Children with ICs tended, unexpectedly, to be less creative. Results of the structured interview about ICs showed that the phenomenology of ICs was similar to that of adult VHs. Childhood ICs fell within the parameters of VH definitions. A statistical difference was found between the 'adult' and 'child' formats of the questionnaire about the acceptability of having a conversation with an IC. The idea of adults engaging in such behaviour was much less acceptable. In conclusion, ICs among children are more common than previously thought. Frequency occurs at a similar high rate and is phenomenologically strikingly similar to adults' VHs. ICs may represent a social construction of VHs which becomes less acceptable as the individual gets older, resulting in adults' hallucinations being perceived as unacceptable...|$|R
40|$|Proximal femoral {{fractures}} (PFFs) are a {{major health}} concern in the elderly population. Improvements made in implants and surgical techniques resulted in faster rehabilitation and shorter length of hospital stay. Despite this, the reduced physiological reserve, associated co-morbidities and polypharmacy intake of the elderly population put them {{at high risk of}} postoperative complications particularly of infectious origin. Out of 10061 patients with proximal femoral fractures 105 (1. 05 %) developed surgical site infection; 76 (72 %) infections occurred in patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> sustained intracapsular (<b>IC)</b> fractures with the remaining 29 (28 %) infections occurring in patients with extracapsular (EC) neck of femur fractures.

40|$|Purpose – Concern {{has been}} raised over the dubious utility of {{internal}} control (IC) reports that contain vague disclosures of unclear meaning or that contain sweeping, albeit, and confusing statements. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine, from a Malaysian perspective, the internal audit control variables, which are directly responsible for the company to disclose their audit statements voluntarily or mandatorily and make it transparent to the shareholders and public. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 121 publicly traded companies were selected using the systematic sampling method from the target population of 599 companies listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia. The names of the heads of internal audit function of the sample were obtained from the Institute of Internal Auditors Malaysia. Structured interviews were conducted with 40 heads of internal audit function out of 121 companies in order to protect anonymity of the companies that did not feel comfortable responding in writing. Findings – The significant findings of this paper are that those companies which are performing well disclose their IC reports voluntarily and demonstrate a perfect relationship between their IC opinions with high internal audit quality assurance. On the other hand, there is a high level of risk management among those companies <b>who</b> <b>have</b> mandatory <b>IC</b> disclosures. In addition, these companies conduct frequent audit committee meetings due to the pressure from the external auditors. Originality/value – The studies on voluntary and mandatory disclosures by combining the characteristics of IC with audit committee effectiveness are seldom researched in the existing literature. The key contribution of this paper is the usage of IC disclosures coupled with an empirical and theoretical approach for examining the appropriate determinants influencing them.

30|$|In view of {{the results}} {{presented}} in Tables  4, 5 and 6, we can conclude that GOV (especially GOV*CENTRAL), FUND, and SEO tend to explain why firms would like to disclose an IC self-assessment report in general and disclose an IC self-assessment report with an auditor’s attestation in particular. GOV, Central*GOV, and FUND can also explain why firms with IC disclosure would like to further attain an auditor’s attestation, {{but they do not}} explain why firms would like to disclose an IC self-assessment report without attaining an auditor’s attestation. However, the traditional factors documented in previous studies, such as SIZE, LEV, corporate governance proxies, etc., are still the determinants for the voluntary disclosure of self-assessment reports. They are also the determinants for voluntary disclosure with an auditor’s attestation. In addition, GOV, SEO and FUDN can explain the likelihood of disclosure of self-assessment reports and of attaining an auditor’s attestation even when some firms <b>have</b> <b>IC</b> weaknesses. Particularly, FUND has the explanatory power for the disclosure of self-assessment reports and for attaining an auditor’s attestation for a sub-sample of firms that all <b>have</b> <b>IC</b> weaknesses.

Here, the role of this gene was investigated in in vitro QN susceptibility of isolates from Viet Nam. Method: Ninety-eight isolates were obtained from three {{different regions of the}} Binh Phuoc and Dak Nong bordering Cambodia provinces during 2006 - 2008. Among these, 79 were identified as monoclonal infection and were genotyped at the microsatellite pfnhe 1 ms 4760 locus and in vitro QN sensitivity data were obtained for 51 isolates. Parasite growth was assessed in the field using the HRP 2 immunodetection assay.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the epidemiology of IC and the antifungal susceptibility of etiological agents in patients admitted to our surgical intensive care unit (SICU) in Spain. Methods: We designed a prospective, observational, single center, population-based study in a SICU. We included all consecutive adult patients (≥ 18 years old) <b>who</b> <b>had</b> documented <b>IC,</b> either on admission or during their stay, between January 2012 and December 2013. Results: There were a total of 22 episodes of IC in the 1149 patients admitted during the 24 -month study. The overall IC incidence was 19. 1 cases per 1000 admissions. Thirteen cases of IC (59. 1 %) were intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) and 9 (40. 9 %) were candidemias. All cases of IAC were patients with secondary peritonitis and severe sepsis or septic shock. The overall crude mortality rate was 13. 6 %; while, it was 33 % in patients with candidemia. All patients with IAC survived, including one patient with concomitant candidemia. The most common species causing IC was Candida albicans (13; 59. 1 %) followed by Candida parapsilosis (5; 22. 7 %), and Candida glabrata (2; 9. 1 %). There was also one case each (4. 5 %) of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis. Thus, the ratio of non-C. albicans (9) to C. albicans (13) was 1 : 1. 4. There was resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole in 13. 6 % of cases. Resistance to other antifungals was uncommon. Conclusions: Candida parapsilosis was the second most common species after C. albicans, indicating the high prevalence of non-C. albicans species in the SICU. Resistance to azoles, particularly fluconazole, should be considered when starting an empirical treatment. Although IAC is a very frequent form of IC in critically ill surgical patients, prompt antifungal therapy and adequate source control appears to lead to a good outcome. However, our results are closely related to our ICU and any generalization must be taken with caution. Therefore, further investigations are needed.

40|$|Late preterm infants (born at 34 - 36 weeks gestation) have {{increasingly}} {{been regarded as}} 'at risk' rather than 'Iow risk' infants. The impact of neonatal morbidity and admission for neonatal care, on the longer term outcomes of LPls has not been fully explored. This thesis has sought to bridge an identified {{gap in the literature}} relating to this significant group of neonatal care graduates. The overall aim of this thesis was to consider the significant population of LPls who require admission for neonatal care. Firstly, maternal and perinatal risk factors and neonatal outcomes were considered through a descriptive analysis of neonatal data from the Neonatal Intensive Care Outcomes Research and Evaluation (NICORE) database. The second component of the thesis then considered specifically the early childhood development (cognition, language, motor development, physical health and growth) at three years of age of LPls who required neonatal Intensive Care (lC) compared with infants of the same gestational age who did not require Intensive Care. LPls who required neonatal care were identified as a unique group, with distinct characteristics and outcomes in the neonatal period when compared to other admitted infants. LPls requiring Intensive Care (<b>IC)</b> <b>had</b> increased maternal and perinatal risk factors and increased adverse neonatal outcomes compared to LPls who required Special Care Only (SCO). Findings from the follow-up study revealed that despite increased maternal and perinatal risk factors and neonatal morbidity, LPls who required admission to <b>IC</b> <b>had</b> similar cognitive, language and motor abilities and growth, compared with their peers, who were not admitted for le. However, LPls <b>who</b> required <b>IC</b> <b>had</b> increased health service usage compared to the non-IC infants. Having considered, for the first time, the neonatal outcomes and early childhood development of LPls {{on the basis of their}} requirement for neonatal Intensive Care, this thesis has provided a novel insight into the outcomes of this under-researched group of children.

In this study, {{a series of}} triazene derivatives holding alkyl and aryl moieties were synthesized and proved to be potent cytotoxic agents in-vitro particularly against eight cancer cell lines (PC 3, HT 29, Hela, HL 60, Jurkat, K 562, MCF 7, HepG 2) and a non-cancerous cell line (HUVEC). The cytotoxic activity was assessed using two methods, LDH assay, and trypan blue exclusion. Some of the triazene derivatives showed cytotoxic activity more than temozolomide (TMZ) as the reference drug. The synthesized triazenes showed marked cytotoxicity effects on all eight cancer cell lines. Among the compounds synthesized, 1, 3 -bis(2 -ethoxyphenyl) triazene C had unique efficacy and selectivity so that it <b>had</b> <b>IC</b> 50 between 0. 560 - 3. 33 µM on cancer cell lines and 12. 61 μM on normal cell line (HUVEC). 1 -(4 -nitrophenyl) - 3 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) triazene E shows weaker effect on cancer cell lines than the other compounds <b>having</b> <b>IC</b> 50 between 3 - 15. 54 μM...|$|R

40|$|A {{structurally}} diverse {{library of}} 93 lipophilic di- and tricyclic diaminopyrimidine derivatives was {{tested for the}} ability to inhibit recombinant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cloned from human and bovine isolates of Cryptosporidium parvum (J. R. Vásquez et al., Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 79 : 153 – 165, 1996). In parallel, the library was also tested against human DHFR and, for comparison, the enzyme from Escherichia coli. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) were determined by means of a standard spectrophotometric assay of DHFR activity with dihydrofolate and NADPH as the cosubstrates. Of the compounds tested, 25 <b>had</b> <b>IC</b> 50 s in the 1 to 10 μM range against one or both C. parvum enzymes and thus were not substantially different from trimethoprim (IC 50 s, ca. 4 μM). Another 25 compounds <b>had</b> <b>IC</b> 50 s of 10 μM) and thus were not considered to be of interest as drugs useful against this organism. A good correlation was generally obtained between the results of the spectrophotometric enzyme inhibition assays and those obtained recently in a yeast complementation assay (V. H. Brophy et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 44 : 1019 – 1028, 2000; H. Lau et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 45 : 187 – 195, 2001). Although many of the compounds in the library were more potent than trimethoprim, none had the degree of selectivity of trimethoprim for C. parvum versus human DHFR. Collectively, the results of these assays comprise the largest available database of lipophilic antifolates as potential anticryptosporidial agents. The compounds in the library were also tested as inhibitors of the proliferation of intracellular C. parvum oocysts in canine kidney epithelial cells cultured in folate-free medium containing thymidine (10 μM) and hypoxanthine (100 μM). After 72 h of drug exposure, the number of parasites inside the cells was quantitated by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Sixteen compounds <b>had</b> <b>IC</b> 50 s of < 3 μM, and five of these <b>had</b> <b>IC</b> 50 s of < 0. 3 μM and thus were comparable in potency to trimetrexate. The finding that submicromolar concentrations of several of the compounds in the library could inhibit in vitro growth of C. parvum in host cells in the presence of thymidine (dThd) and hypoxanthine (Hx) suggests that lipophilic DHFR inhibitors, in combination with leucovorin, may find use in the treatment of intractable C. parvum infections...|$|R

Since testing can control teaching and it holds an important part in the teaching learning process, a teacher should {{be able to make a}} good test. One of the criteria of a good test is the predictive validity. The result of a test can be used to predict the future success of the students. In this study, the writer wants to know whether the result of the IC Oral test of the English Department of Widya Mandala Catholic University can be used to predict the students' success in their Speaking 1 achievement. The subjects of this study are 111 students of 1994 - 1995 academic year <b>who</b> <b>have</b> passed <b>IC</b> Oral test and Speaking 1 test. In this study, the writer uses statistical analysis. From the writer's analysis, she finds that there is a positive significant correlation between the 1994 IC Oral test and the 1995 Speaking 1 test scores (the correlation coefficient both of the tests is 0. 44 and it is bigger than r table). Since both of the tests have a significant correlation, it means that the 1994 IC Oral test scores can be used to predict the 1995 Speaking 1 test scores. By using the regression equation of y = 41. 67 + 0. 47 x the writer can compute the estimated scores of Speaking 1 test. In this case, the writer finds that 58 students get higher scores than the writer's estimation. Among those students, the scores of 18 students deviate more than 7. However, 53 students get lower scores than the writer's estimation and among those students, the scores of 18 students deviate more than 7 (the figure 7 is taken from the standard deviation of the estimated scores [...] Sy = 6. 755). Horvath (1985, p. 284) says that the regression will be significant only if r is significant. In this case, the writer finds that the ratio for the regression coefficient is 5. 165. It is bigger than t table, so that it proves that the 1994 IC Oral test is significant in playing a role in predicting the students' achievement in the Speaking 1 test.
