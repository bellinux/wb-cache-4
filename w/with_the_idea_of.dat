5|$|The {{most obvious}} technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project.

5|$|ATLs {{story is}} {{loosely based on}} {{material}} by producers Dallas Austin and Tionne Watkins, who set out to describe their experiences growing up {{on the south side}} of Atlanta in the early '90s. Watkins and producer Jody Gerson approached James Lassiter <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a story about a skating rink that many involved in the Atlanta music scene had started at, and how all of these people would attend the rink every Sunday night in their teen years.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured {{the idea of}} a holiday camp. He had seen the way landladies in seaside resorts would, {{sometimes}} literally, push families out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather.

5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E

5|$|IDW Publishing {{released}} a four-issue prequel written by Chuck Dixon. Each issue focuses on Duke, Destro, The Baroness and Snake Eyes respectively. It began publication in March 2009. The weekly film adaptation {{was written by}} Denton J. Tipton and drawn by Casey Maloney. The film's universe continued in a limited series about Snake Eyes later in 2009: Ray Park enjoyed playing the character and approached writer Kevin VanHook and artist S. L. Gallant <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a comic further exploring his incarnation of the character.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 {{he decided}} to live there year-round, and in May that year moved from New York with Ilse, their son, Peter, and Reich's {{daughter}} Eva, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> creating a centre {{for the study of}} orgone. Several colleagues moved there with him, including two physicians with an interest in orgone, and Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Press Institute. The artist William Moise joined Reich as an assistant at Orgonon, later marrying Eva Reich.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and particularly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly {{prominent in the}} source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies {{and replace them with}} changelings.|$|E

5|$|Since 1993, Curtis had {{frequently}} read {{morning news}} stories and exchanged them with friends.

5|$|The {{sporting}} event was started at Little Wittenham Bridge in 1984 by the lockkeeper, Lynn David, as a fund-raising {{event for the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).

5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E

Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that {{on the basis of the}} journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1947, García Márquez {{stayed in}} Bogotá to study {{law at the}} Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he had a special dedication to reading. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies {{as if they were}} simply an aspect of everyday life». His desire to be a writer grew. A little later, he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the September 13th, 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.|$|E
