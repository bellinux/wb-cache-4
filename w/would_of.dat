The technical characteristics of many Heathkits were good. The ordinary consumer <b>would,</b> <b>of</b> course, buy a factory-built phonograph from the likes of RCA; but an audiophile, who was serious enough to assemble a system from individual components, frequently gave serious consideration to Heathkit products (for example, the AR15 and AR1500 receivers).|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{these and}} all other {{combined}} oral contraceptives are mixtures of 1–2% EE or mestranol and an oral progestin. It has been speculated that {{the discovery of the}} necessity of estrogen in addition to progestin for contraceptive efficacy is due to the presence of a small amount of unreduced EME (1) in early batches of 2. This when subjected to oxidation and ethynylation, <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course lead to mestranol (3). In any event, the need for the presence of estrogen in the mixture is now well established experimentally.|$|E
25|$|The {{impossibility of}} faster-than-light {{relative}} speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal (faster-than-light) travel {{by ensuring that}} {{the speed of light}} is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them outside the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space outside the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the wormhole <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course beat the traveler.|$|E

25|$|In February 1846 the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway exerted {{pressure}} {{for the general}} station to be built, and the architect John Dobson was appointed by Hudson to design it, {{in association with the}} engineer T E Harrison, and Robert Stephenson. By now the general alignment of Hudson's railways was becoming clear: a main line from the south via Gateshead would approach over the High Level Bridge and enter the general station from the east; the Newcastle and Berwick line would be extended from Carliol Square and also enter from the east; through trains from London to Scotland would reverse in the new station. Newcastle and Carlisle Railway trains <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course enter from the west.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, the {{governors}} of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, Poe v. Lynchburg Training School & Hospital (1981), was filed in the courts {{on the grounds that}} the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.|$|E

25|$|So far as Edinburgh's guided {{transportation}} systems are concerned, the troubled tramway scheme for Edinburgh has enjoyed the limelight for some years. First seriously planned in 2003, {{the emphasis was}} on connecting the airport and northern suburbs to the city centre although a branch route to Newcraighall was contemplated, and later dropped. None of the proposals involved running on the Suburban Line, although a tram-train solution has been advocated by a special interest group: this would have involved vehicles running on the Suburban Line and transferring to street running to achieve a more direct and convenient access to the city centre. This {{would have had the}} incidental advantage of avoiding adding to the train movements on the congested four-track section of the main line from Haymarket to Waverley, but <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course have constrained the route options on the South Side.|$|E
25|$|The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 {{created the}} Office of Personal Management, {{to oversee the}} human {{resource}} management of the federal government, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, to regulate the merit system and prevent any abuse. The major provisions in the act included, but were not limited to, performance appraisals for all employees, merit pay {{on a variety of}} levels (but focusing on managerial levels), and modifications for dealing with poor performers. This merit pay system was a break in the long tradition of automatic salary increases based on length of service. Under the new act, employees only got half of their traditional automatic salary increase. The remaining non-automatic portion was divided up according to performance rating. A key part of this system was that it was revenue neutral—this meant that when some employees benefited under the new system, others <b>would</b> <b>of</b> necessity be receive less than in the previous system.|$|E
25|$|The Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language {{was founded}} in 1900 by Louis Couturat and others; it {{tried to get the}} International Association of Academies to take up the {{question}} of an international auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, the meta-academy declining to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself. Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido. Ido drew a significant number of speakers away from Esperanto in the short term, but in the longer term most of these either returned to Esperanto or moved on to other new auxlangs. Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called Esperantidos, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.|$|E

25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.|$|E
25|$|Finally a {{settlement}} {{seemed to have}} been reached when the rebel officers asked to see Mazaki on the 27th. Mazaki, accompanied by two other members of the SMC (Nobuyuki Abe and Yoshikazu Nishi), arrived at the Ministry of War at 16:00. Gathered there were all the rebel officers except Andō and Kurihara, who were in charge of the troops outside, and Kōno, who was still hospitalized. The rebels told Mazaki that they were entrusting everything to him. Mazaki thanked them, but explained that he could do nothing until they returned to their units. He also stated that he would fight them himself if they went against the Emperor's wishes. The rebels replied that if they received a formal order to return, they <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course obey it. Following the meeting, both Mazaki and the rebel officers were relieved. Mazaki believed the rebel officers would leave without violence and the rebels were apparently convinced that a Mazaki cabinet would be formed shortly after they did so. Kashii issued orders for the troops to stay the night in the buildings they had occupied and reported to the Emperor that the situation would be resolved by the morning.|$|E
500|$|Another common {{situation}} in the interplay between the two boards is a player not moving, also called sitting or stalling. This can happen {{in anticipation of a}} certain piece or {{at the request of the}} partner. Suppose a player is under heavy attack, and an additional pawn would mate him. When the partner cannot prevent giving up a pawn on the next move, sitting is the only strategy. It <b>would</b> <b>of</b> course be perfectly logical for the attacker to sit as well, waiting for a pawn to come. The situation where diagonal opponents sit at the same time is known as a [...] "sitzkrieg" [...] (literally [...] "sitting war" [...] in German, and a pun on [...] "blitzkrieg"). The difference in time between the diagonal opponents will eventually force one party to move. This diagonal time advantage is more important than the difference on the clock between opponents on the same board.|$|E

500|$|He had {{his first}} glimpse of coral atolls as they passed Honden Island on 9 November and sailed on through the Low or Dangerous Archipelago (Tuamotus). Arriving at Tahiti on 15 November, Darwin saw it [...] "encircled by a Coral reef {{separated}} from the shore by channels & basins of still water". He climbed the hills of Tahiti, and was strongly impressed by the sight across to the island of Eimeo, where [...] "The mountains abruptly rise out of a glassy lake, which is separated on all sides, by a narrow defined line of breakers, from the open sea. – Remove the central group of mountains, & there remains a Lagoon Isd." [...] Rather than recording his findings about the coral reefs in his notes about the island, he wrote them up as the first full draft of his theory, an essay titled Coral Islands, dated 1835. They left Tahiti on 3 December, and Darwin probably wrote his essay as they sailed towards New Zealand where they arrived on 21 December. He described the polyp species building the coral on the barrier wall, flourishing in the heavy surf of breaking waves particularly on the windward side, and speculated on reasons that corals in the calm lagoon did not grow so high. He concluded with a [...] "remark that the general horizontal uplifting which I have proved has & is now raising upwards {{the greater part of}} S. America & as it would appear likewise of N. America, <b>would</b> <b>of</b> necessity be compensated by an equal subsidence in some other part of the world." ...|$|E
