5|$|Swannell {{played as}} a forward, {{and in his}} last Test {{specifically}} at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He would turn up for training in unwashed kit, and <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pair of breeches for every game, again unwashed. His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character {{in the eyes of}} other players.|$|E
5|$|An {{anthropomorphic}} cougar named Ozzie was the team's mascot from 1997 to 2014. The original Ozzie {{came from}} the Class A Kane County Cougars minor league team, which had an extra mascot costume. The surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville, and, after building a fan following during Ozzie's first season, team management decided to make him the permanent mascot. The original Ozzie costume was brown, but a new yellow costume was introduced in 1998. Ozzie <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. Ozzie was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014, although he continued to make appearances during the 2014 to 2015 off-season.|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{had been}} one of 28 people aboard the first {{lifeboat}} to be launched from Titanic and was rescued about five and a half hours after leaving the ship.

When the boy did not return home for meals, Mariano's father went looking for his son. He was surprised to find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to Cusco to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.|$|E
5|$|The SS {{established}} its own symbolism, rituals, customs, {{ranks and}} uniforms to set itself {{apart from other}} organizations.

The SS also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with camouflage patterns. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labor. Many were produced in concentration camps.|$|E

5|$|The two {{character}} {{artists for}} the Persona series are Kazuma Kaneko, a central {{artist in the}} main Megami Tensei series who designed characters {{for the first three}} Persona games, and Shigenori Soejima, who worked in a secondary capacity alongside Kaneko and took Kaneko's place as the character designer from Persona 3 onwards. While designing the characters for Persona, Kaneko was inspired by multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of the time, along with members of Atlus staff. In Persona and Innocent Sin, the main characters all <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> school uniforms, so Kaneko differentiated them using accessories. For Eternal Punishment, the main cast were adults, so Kaneko needed to rethink his design procedure. Eventually, he adopted the concept of ordinary adults, and gave them designs that would stand out in-game.|$|E
