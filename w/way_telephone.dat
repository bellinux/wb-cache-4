40|$|The classic docudramas {{were created}} from a {{combination}} of reality, simulation and fiction. In modern television, some of these programmes try to attract viewers by having them take part {{in the development of the}} story by means of any process that has some degree of interactivity. In this <b>way,</b> <b>telephone</b> calls, text messages, e-mails or the possibilities of digital terrestrial television (DTT) have become mechanisms to both enrich the stories and capture audience. Productions of this type continue to veer away from authentic events of journalistic interest, and the showy component is given greater weight than the interests of the informative features. When one resorts thematically to dramatic situations, the temptation to invent information increases and the format becomes distanced from the rigor and precision required by journalism. Any invented actions can be presented as authentic situations by technological innovations like virtual reality. Nevertheless, the problem lies not in the machines or in the software, but in how they are used, and there are, in fact, professionals who use them to increase the quality of their work...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Out-of-hours {{primary care}} {{services}} {{have a high}} general practitioner (GP) workload with increasing costs, while half of all contacts are non-urgent. OBJECTIVES: To identify views of GPs to influence {{the use of the}} out-of-hours GP cooperatives. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey study among a random sample of 800 GPs in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Of the 428 respondents (53. 5 % response rate), 86. 5 % confirmed an increase in their workload and 91. 8 % felt that the number of patient contacts could be reduced. A total of 75. 4 % GP respondents reported that the 24 -h service society was a 'very important' reason why patients with non-urgent problems attended the GP cooperative; the equivalent for worry or anxiety was 65. 8 %, and for easy accessibility, 60. 1 %. Many GPs (83. 9 %) believed that the <b>way</b> <b>telephone</b> triage is currently performed contributes to the high use of GP cooperatives. Measures that GPs believed were both desirable and effective in reducing the use of GP cooperatives included co-payment for patients, stricter triage, and a larger role for the telephone consultation doctor. GPs considered patient education, improved telephone accessibility of daytime general practices, more possibilities for same-day appointments, as well as feedback concerning the use of GP cooperatives to practices and triage nurses also desirable, but less effective. CONCLUSION: This study provides several clues for influencing the use of GP cooperatives. Further research is needed to examine the impact and safety of these strategies. [Box: see text]...|$|E

Moreover, IVPS retains the traditional dialing <b>way</b> with <b>telephone</b> number and downward capability with the recent analog telephone.

500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the <b>way</b> <b>telephones</b> were interfaced into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset off-hook etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground.

It operated much the <b>way</b> American <b>Telephone</b> and Telegraph operated until 1983, owning all of its equipment and refusing to communicate with non-Marconi equipped ships. In June 1912, after the RMS Titanic disaster, due to increased production Marconi opened the world's first purpose-built radio factory at New Street Works in Chelmsford, and in 1932 the Marconi Research Laboratory. Many inventions improved the quality of radio, and amateurs experimented with uses of radio, thus planting the first seeds of broadcasting.|$|R
