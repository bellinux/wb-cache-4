Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their alternate airport and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now <b>we,</b> <b>we,</b> don't, we run out of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its alternate airport. The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their alternate airport.

500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't <b>we?</b> <b>We</b> have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} in the press that the Sauber, Lotus and Force India teams had considered withdrawing from the race to signal a message to Formula One's commercial leaders about the current financial state of the sport following Caterham and Marussia's non-participation in the race. Ecclestone stated that if two of those teams left Formula One then [...] "that is what will happen" [...] and that teams should only be taking part if they were competitive. Force India team principal Bob Fernley said discussions about a boycott but it would only be performed as a final recourse. Lotus owner Gérard Lopez later admitted he had not heard about the proposed boycott and the team insisted that they would contest the Grand Prix. Vijay Mallya, the owner of Force India, severely criticised suggestions of a boycott six days after the race: [...] "Who said that we wanted to boycott the race? Please tell me. If I am wrong, you educate me. I speak on behalf of Force India. I have never said {{that we are going to}} boycott, and I have clarified this in Austin. Why would <b>we?</b> <b>We</b> have come to go racing." ...|$|E
