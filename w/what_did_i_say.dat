500|$|Filming {{also took}} place in Manali and Film City in Mumbai. During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik {{described}} the incident as a [...] "freak accident", stating, [...] "I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> guess the right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic)." [...] Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, {{scattering}} {{scraps of}} paper about, or scuffing the landscape, or getting jam or molasses {{on the face of}} nature, or having bonfires in the back yard of the palace, or leaving dolls around on the throne. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> about asking questions?

6000|$|... "Maiden," [...] {{he said in}} his gentle voice, [...] "maiden who soon {{shall be}} a wife, I do not sleep, {{although}} I dream of you as I have dreamt before. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to you that day when first we met? That for you I had good tidings; that though death was all about you, you need not fear; that in this place you who had known great sorrow should find happiness and rest. Yet, maiden, you would not believe the words of the Munwali, spoken by his prophet's lips, as he at your side, who shall be your husband, would not believe me in years past when I told him that we should meet again." ...|$|E

"Having had a {{great deal}} too much to eat and drink three hours before, my {{partners}} must have chicken and rack-punch at Vauxhall, where George fell asleep straightway, and for my sins I must tell Tony Storer what I knew about this Virginian's amiable family, especially some of the Bernstein's antecedents, and the history of another elderly beauty of the family, a certain Lady Maria, who was au mieux with the late Prince of Wales. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> I protest not half of what I knew, and of course not a tenth part of what I was going to tell, for who should start out upon us but my savage, this time quite red in the face; and in his war paint.

2500|$|Howarth {{went on to}} say Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding did {{not make}} sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. [...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said. [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.'

To follow him was useless, for in that rain and darkness two people might have searched for each other all night in a single field. That he would go to the Spittal, thinking her in Rintoul's dogcart, she did not doubt; and his distress was painful to her to think of. But not knowing that the burns were in flood, she underestimated his danger.|$|R
