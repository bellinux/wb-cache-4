5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and timber castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> useless. This {{is evidenced by the}} continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{questions}} <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> {{restricted to}} practical problems, {{but many of}} them, in case the interpretation of a halakic or haggadic passage in the Talmud {{was the subject of}} inquiry, were theoretical in nature. In their discussion of theoretical problems the responsa of the Spanish scholars are noteworthy for the untrammeled scientific spirit that permeates them far more than those of the French school. Even in responsa that are practical in bearing, a distinction may be drawn between the two schools. Although these response can still be found in significant response anthologies today, they are not as significant as the response written during the Geonic period.|$|E
25|$|The {{storming}} parties {{began to}} advance, first crossing a narrow gulley between {{the lake and}} the pā. Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged with the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the pā. There followed a savage and confused battle. Eventually the discipline and cohesiveness of the British troops began to prevail and the Māori were driven back inside the pā. But they <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> beaten, far from it, as without artillery the British {{had no way to}} overcome the defences of the pā.

25|$|The Nashville sit-ins {{reached a}} turning point when the house of Z. Alexander Looby, a {{prominent}} African-American attorney and leader, was bombed. Although no one was killed, thousands of protesters spontaneously marched to Nashville City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West. The mayor had offered only weak half-measures and vacillated toward segregation. Meeting the mass of protesters outside city hall, West informally debated with them and concluded by conceding that segregation was immoral. The bombing, the march, and Mayor West's statement helped convince downtown lunch counters to desegregate. Although segregation and Jim Crow <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> over, the episode served {{as one of the}} first successful events of nonviolent protest, and as a significant example to the rest of the nation.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s saw {{something}} of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, {{as well as the}} hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, after {{elaborate}} reconnaissance, the Union's fleet steamed {{into position}} below the forts {{and prepared for}} the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip. On April 18, the mortar boats opened fire. Their shells fell with great accuracy, and although one of the boats was sunk by counter-fire and two more were disabled, Fort Jackson was seriously damaged. However, the defenses <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> crippled, even after a second bombardment on April 19. A formidable obstacle to the advance of the Union main fleet was a boom between the forts, designed to detain vessels under close fire if they attempted to run past. Gunboats were repeatedly sent at night to endeavor to destroy the barrier, but they had little success. US Navy bombardment of the forts continued, disabling only a few Confederate guns. The gunners of Fort Jackson were under cover and limited {{in their ability to}} respond.|$|E
25|$|Lewis' {{interests}} and {{activities in the}} 1930s <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> exclusively political. Despite serious illness necessitating several operations, he was very productive as a critic and painter, and produced a book of poems, One-Way Song, in 1933 (the link below gives access to a recording of him reading an extract). He also produced a revised version of Enemy of the Stars, first published in Blast in 1914 as an example to his literary colleagues of how Vorticist literature should be written. It is a proto-absurdist, Expressionist drama, and some critics have identified it as a precursor to the plays of Samuel Beckett. An important book of critical essays also belongs to this period: Men without Art (1934). It {{grew out of a}} defence of Lewis's own satirical practice in The Apes of God, and puts forward a theory of 'non-moral', or metaphysical, satire. But the book is probably best remembered for one of the first commentaries on Faulkner, and a famous essay on Hemingway.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, {{he became}} Chief of the Army Ordnance Technical Intelligence teams {{assigned}} to Europe {{to seek out}} and evaluate captured enemy ordnance weapons and equipment. During this time, Toftoy received a request from Colonel Gervais Trichel, chief of the rocket branch in the Ordnance Department at the Pentagon, to acquire and ship 100 operational V-2 rockets to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for testing. Soon after the capture of the area around Nordhausen and the Mittelwerk, Toftoy set up Special Mission V-2 to do the job. He assigned Major William Bromley {{in command of the}} special mission, and he reported back to Toftoy through Major James P. Hammill, who was responsible for shipping the weapons from Nordhausen to Antwerp, and from there to New Orleans. Bromley and Hamill went to central Germany to salvage as many missiles as they could, under pressure because of the unwelcome news that U.S. forces would be withdrawing soon. Although there <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> a hundred complete V-2s available, Toftoy organized U.S soldiers and camp workers to put partially completed rockets and major components into hastily requisitioned rail cars. From 22 to 31 May, several freight trains left Nordhausen for Antwerp loaded with missile and missile parts; thus successfully completing the mission.|$|E
25|$|Hannibal {{won over}} most of the minor Oscan-speaking socii of {{southern}} Italy: Bruttii and Lucani, as well as the minority of the Greek city-states. The adherence of much of southern Italy gave Hannibal a relatively stable power-base that sustained his military presence in Italy for 13 years after Cannae. The Samnites, Bruttii and Lucani were, as demonstrated above, the biggest losers in Rome's territorial expansion. Of the Greek cities of the Ionian Sea, Tarentum would certainly have defected immediately after Cannae if it hadn't been under the control of a Roman garrison, placed there in 218 BC to prevent precisely such an event. The Tarentines eventually succeeded in allowing in Hannibal's army in 212, although the Romans continued to hold the citadel, which reduced the value of the gain for Hannibal. Thurii, Heraclea, Metapontum, Locri and Croton did defect after Cannae. But even in the South, defections to Hannibal <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> universal. Apart from the Arpini in the north of Apulia, the rest of the Apulians and the Messapii mostly remained loyal to Rome, as they had done during the Pyrrhic invasion and for the same reason: fear of Tarentine expansionism. The Greek cities on the Tyrrhenian Sea — Rhegium and Neapolis — also refused to defect and remained staunchly loyal to Rome after Cannae. The Neapolitans had an intense rivalry with the Campanians, while the Rhegians had long struggled for survival against Hannibal's Bruttian allies. Also, for both cities, Tarentine hegemony was anathema. Neapolis was the main seaport of Campania, which in turn was the principal theatre of war. Rhegium controlled one shore of the Strait of Messina and thus hindered Hannibal's communications with Carthaginian forces in Sicily. For these reasons, Hannibal's failure to take these two strategic ports greatly complicated the reinforcement and resupply of his army from Africa. Finally, all four of the major Samnite tribes, ,, refused to join their minor compatriots' revolt.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> {{the only}} team to {{have come up with}} the idea of {{dropping}} the centre half into defence – Newcastle United beat Arsenal 7–0 that season employing such a system with Charlie Spencer at centre-half; Queen's Park and Tottenham Hotspur had also adopted similar systems. Chapman, however, was able to refine and improve on the idea better than his rivals, melding the tactical change with his own ideas on counter-attacking football, pacy wingers and a strong defence. Chapman himself summed it up by saying: [...] "the most opportune time for scoring is immediately after repelling an attack, because opponents are then strung out in the wrong half of the field." ...|$|E
