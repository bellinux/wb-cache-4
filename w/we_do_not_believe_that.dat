There {{is no doubt that}} Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.|$|E

Questions on Doctrine stated that Adventists believe [...] "That man is free to choose or reject the offer of salvation through Christ; <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> God has predetermined that some men shall be saved and others lost."

2500|$|You {{note that}} I and President Joseph Fielding Smith {{and some of}} our early church leaders have said and written about this {{doctrine}} and you asked if the doctrine of blood atonement is an official doctrine of the Church today. If by blood atonement is meant the atoning sacrifice of Christ, the answer is Yes. If by blood atonement is meant the shedding of the blood of men to atone in some way for their own sins, the answer is No. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is necessary for men in this day to shed their own blood to receive a remission of sins. This is said with a full awareness of what I and others have written and said on this subject in times past. In order to understand what Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Charles W. Penrose and others have said, we must mention that there are some sins for which the blood of Christ alone does not cleanse a person. [...] These include blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (as defined by the Church) and that murder which is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice. [...] However, and this cannot be stressed too strongly, this law has not been given to the Church at any time in this dispensation. [...] It has no application whatever to anyone now living whether he is a member or a non-member of the Church.|$|E

60|$|Young men, {{very young}} men,--men so young {{that it may}} be almost a {{question}} whether or no they have as yet reached their manhood,--are more inclined to be earnest and thoughtful when alone than they ever are when with others, even though those others be their elders.

It is, however, no doubt, true that thought will not at once produce wisdom. It may almost be a question whether such wisdom as many of us have in our mature years has not come from the dying out of the power of temptation, rather than as the results of thought and resolution.

But powerful personalities are becoming of less and less account, when facility of communication has given both force and the means of exerting it to the sentiment of civilized mankind, and when commerce has made the banker's strong-box a true temple of Janus, the shutting or opening of which means peace or war. Battles are decisive now not so much by the destruction of armies as by the defeat of public spirit, and a something that has actually happened may be a less important fact, either in conjecturing probabilities or determining policy, than the indefinable progress of change, not marked on any dial, but instinctively divined, that is taking place in the general thought.|$|E
