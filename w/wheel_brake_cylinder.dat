40|$|In mixed-mode braking applications, the {{electric}} motor / generator (M/G) and hydraulic pressure valve are controlled {{to meet the}} driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking demand. Controlling these braking elements is achieved by modulating the current generated by the M/G and adjusting the fluid pressure to the <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders.</b> This paper aims to model and design combined regenerative and hydraulic braking systems which, comprise an induction electric machine, inverter, NiMH battery, controller, a pressure source, pressure control unit, and brake calipers. A 15 kW 1500 rpm induction machine equipped with a reduction gear having a gear ratio of 4 is used. A hydraulic brake capable to produce fluid pressure up to 40 bar is used. Direct torque control and pressure control are chosen as the control criteria in the M/G and the hydraulic solenoid valve. The braking demands for the system are derived from the Federal Testing Procedure (FTP) drive cycle. Two simulation models have been developed in Matlab®/Simulink® to analyze {{the performance of the}} control strategy in each braking system. The developed model is validated through experiment. It is concluded that the control system does introduce torque ripple and pressure oscillation in the braking system, but these effects do not affect vehicle braking performance due to the high frequency nature of pressure fluctuation and the damping effect of the vehicle inertia. Moreover, experiment results prove the effectiveness of the developed model...|$|R
40|$|Road safety {{has been}} the subject of {{interest}} for research from the time the first automotive was invented. Safety has been characterized by many factors but the most prominent is maintaining control over the vehicle motion in all situations. Modern safety systems especially Antilock Braking System (ABS) in combination with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) has brought down the uncontrollable occasions in driving and therefore, sheltering the passengers from accidents. This system ensures the control of the vehicle while braking in varying surface conditions by keeping the friction coefficient close to optimal which helps in preventing wheel lock up and minimizing the braking distance. The current methods employ complex heuristic rules and optimization is still required in algorithm development. The ABS provides reference pressure signals to be achieved in different <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> to a low level controller termed as the brake pressure controller. This low level controller needs to be as precise as possible considering the challenges of hydraulic line characteristics and unavailability of states. Some researchers have investigated this area earlier and there have been performance issues which are yet to be solved. Of these, the core issue was the inability of the controller to adapt to variable conditions. Hence, an adaptive control approach is proposed to this problem. The project aims to optimize the functioning of the brake pressure controller. This report will introduce the reader to the test vehicle and its braking system to be controlled. It will also identify the objectives of the controller and learn the limitations of the hydraulic circuit. Further, 2 models derived from the literature will be compared from analysis on experimental data. Finally, the formulation of adaptive control algorithm and the implementation strategy along with control of essential secondary components will be addressed. This implementation of reliable brake pressure controller along with its performance evaluation will serve as a foundation for realization for future novel ABS algorithms.

5000|$|The 1979 {{model year}} saw a new {{downsized}} Newport on the Chrysler R platform, a derivative of the circa 1962 Chrysler B platform. This reduced model availability {{to a single}} [...] "pillared hardtop" [...] 4-door sedan. While GM and Ford had downsized their big cars by engineering smaller bodies around more spacious passenger accommodations, Chrysler took a different approach. The existing Chrysler B platform was modified to improve fuel efficiency {{through a number of}} weight saving measures. Examples include plastic <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> pistons, which tended to swell and bind up the brakes after a some years in service. Chrome-plated aluminum bumpers were another innovation, but were replaced in 1980 with a stronger steel rear bumper. The large displacement V8 engines were dropped.|$|R

50|$|The engine's vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> were fitted {{outside the}} main frames under the running boards on each side, between {{the second and}} third pairs of coupled <b>wheels.</b> The vacuum <b>brake</b> {{operated}} automatically whenever the train brakes were applied. The use of vacuum braking instead of steam braking became standard practice on locomotives built from 1944 onwards and was welcomed by SAR drivers, who were always reluctant to make use of steam brakes for fear of skidding the coupled wheels. In practice, the trigger on the steam brake attachment to isolate the proportional device which admitted steam to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> automatically upon the application of the vacuum brake, was invariably wedged down with a wooden peg by drivers to eliminate the steam brake entirely.|$|R

40|$|Wheel slide {{protection}} devices (WSPD) {{are destined to}} avoid important sliding of <b>wheels</b> during <b>braking</b> actions in case of temporarily impaired wheel-rail adhesion by correspondent reductions of air pressure in <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Accordingly, longer <b>braking</b> distances and higher longitudinal in-train forces occur, potentially affecting the traffic safety and the passengers comfort. A general analyse and evaluation of these effects are the main targets of the present study. The theoretical considerations are sustained by simulations of braking process, considering situations of normal, respectively diminished wheel-rail adhesion determining random actuations of WSPD. The air pressure evolution in <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> of was experimentally determined on a computerized brake system test stand and adequately used as input in simulations. The results indicate an increase of in-train forces and a more complex evolution of the longitudinal dynamic actions between the vehicles {{in the case of}} degraded wheel-rail adhesion, when the random actuation of WSPD have major influence in the whole braking process...|$|R

50|$|A {{development}} {{introduced in}} the 1950s was the direct admission valve, fitted to every <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These valves responded to a rise in train pipe pressure as the brake was applied, and admitted atmospheric air directly to {{the underside of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{lower than that of}} the reservoir, the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> exhaust portal is closed and air from the car's reservoir is fed into the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Pressure increases in the <b>cylinder,</b> applying the <b>brakes,</b> while decreasing in the reservoir. This action continues until equilibrium between the brake pipe pressure and reservoir pressure is achieved. At that point, the airflow from the reservoir to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure.|$|R

However, in the later modification, the new bogies are being manufactured with the BMBC designs only. Even the old type bogies are being converted into BMBC Bogies. The BMBC bogie has many advantages over the conventional ICF bogie. The foremost being that, since the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{is mounted on}} the bogie frame itself and is nearer to the brake beam, the brake application time is reduced. Moreover, a small <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is adequate for braking purpose. This also reduces the overall weight of the ICF bogie apart from the advantage of quick brake application.|$|R

25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the reservoir charging valve, and the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|R
