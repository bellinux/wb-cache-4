500|$|Each {{section is}} linked by a refrain or {{recurring}} chorus. It {{functions as a}} hook and it differs from the usual [...] "free-associative aspect" [...] of traditional blues. [...] Writer Benjamin Filene sees this and Dixon's desire to tell complete stories, with the verses building on each other, as sharing elements of pop music. [...] The chorus, [...] "But you know I'm here, everybody knows I'm here, <b>Well</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I'm the hoochie coochie man, everybody knows I'm here", confirms the narrator's identity as both {{the subject of the}} gypsy's prophecy as well as an omnipotent seer himself. [...] Dixon felt that the lyrics expressed part of the audience's unfulfilled desire to brag, while Waters later admitted that they were supposed to have a comic effect. [...] Music historian Ted Gioia points to the underlying theme of sexuality and virility as sociologically significant. [...] He sees it as challenge to the fear of miscegenation in the dying days of racial segregation in the United States. [...] Record producer Marshall Chess took a simpler view: [...] "It was sex. [...] If you have ever seen Muddy then, the effect he had on women [...] [...] Because the blues, you know, has always been a women's market".|$|E

500|$|An unused {{scene was}} drafted showing Chris, {{directly}} after hearing Lois' prison term, flashbacking {{back to him}} watching Six Feet Under, seeing a same-sex couple kissing, and exclaiming [...] "Oh, come on!" [...] The song based around Glen Quagmire was sung and recorded by professional studio singers who sing at {{events such as the}} Academy Awards. The scene following Peter saying to Lois: [...] "I had to do, <b>well</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> that thing that you usually do for me every Thursday night" [...] showing Peter attempting to give himself fellatio, hitting his head on the wall and falling down the stairs was repeatedly fought by broadcasting standards, but they eventually allowed the scene. In the original episode draft, Peter was to be seen falling down the stairs, and Stewie's foot was to be lodged inside Peter's anus, where he was to lose his shoe. Peter breaks the fourth wall and begins to speak with viewers during his interview with the sumo wrestling employee; Executive Producer David A. Goodman comments in the episode DVD commentary that this is [...] "one of the few times, maybe the only time, when [...] can step out of format and point out the format." [...] The [...] "CBS Asiantown" [...] logo shown on the Griffins' television was prohibited from broadcast on the televised version of the episode.|$|E

2500|$|..... when you'd {{finished}} {{your duty}} {{you would come}} away nothing had happened no bombs or anything and the driver would switch his wheel back {{and to make the}} truck waver and the poor wog on the front would roll off into the deck.
