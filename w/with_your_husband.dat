60|$|FROME. You are {{a married}} woman, living <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband?</b> A little louder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'On {{account of}} that slight {{acquaintance}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> I {{thought it would}} be interesting to see what sort of wife he had chosen.' ...|$|E
60|$|McCOMAS (resigning himself). Well, well! What I {{want to say}} is this. In the old {{arrangement}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> Mrs. Clandon, you had him at {{a terrible}} disadvantage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, {{open them}} now. You ought {{to learn a}} little of such matters. A young lady of {{education}} should not be ignorant of money affairs altogether. Suppose you should be left a widow some day, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> title-deeds and investments thrown upon your hands--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{think of}} you," [...] Tavernake said slowly, [...] "nothing could alter, but because I am stupid, I suppose, there {{is quite a}} good deal that I cannot understand. I cannot understand, for instance, why they should suspect you of having {{anything}} to do <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> disappearance. You can prove where you were when he left you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Damn you, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> smug-faced <b>husband</b> there, and <b>your</b> fine {{auto and}} all, butting into poor folks' troubles!" [...] shrieked Dlorus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see that. You concede {{nothing to}} me and I have to concede {{everything}} to you. After all, you were on good terms <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> at that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me if I am dull," [...] I pleaded, [...] "but {{what is the}} {{connection}} between this house, your quarrels <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> if you ever get one, and Dick's head?" ...|$|E
60|$|AMERICAN. I honour your emotion, ma'am. It does {{credit to}} us all. But I sympathize <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> too. The measles {{is a very}} {{important}} pestilence in connection with a grown woman.|$|E
6000|$|My {{companion}} {{shook his}} head, and entreated me to consider well beforehand what I proposed doing. His advice to me--so strangely do extremes meet!--was my mother-in-law's advice, repeated almost word for word. [...] "Leave {{things as they}} are, my dear. In the interest of your own peace of mind be satisfied <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> affection. You {{know that you are}} his wife, and you know that he loves you. Surely that is enough?" ...|$|R
6000|$|INSPECTOR (taking ticket again). Sampson Dibble and Dorothy Dibble (surveying a {{very old}} couple over his spectacles, <b>with</b> some surprise). <b>Your</b> <b>husband</b> quite blind, Mrs. Dibble? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man who {{was your}} {{rejected}} lover,--who {{has been trying to}} marry you for the last two years, presuming to commence a correspondence <b>with</b> you without <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> sanction!" ...|$|R
60|$|SURFACE. Now my dear Lady Teazle if you {{but once}} make a trifling Faux Pas you can't {{conceive}} how cautious you would grow, and how ready to humour and agree <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>Husband.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{you could}} get {{him to have a}} talk <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> The fact is, it's a sort of {{religious}} mania he's got, and perhaps a clergyman could talk him out of it. Anyhow, it's worth trying.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what," [...] burst forth Leon; [...] "you, Madame, go into another room and talk {{it over with}} my wife; and I'll stay here and talk it over <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> It may come to nothing, but let's try." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “When you’re all home, {{all six of}} you <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{children}} and <b>husbands</b> and wives, there are twenty or thirty people in this house. Then I’m happy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard's {{gone off}} {{somewhere in the}} car to-night, a most mysterious expedition," [...] his sister declared. [...] "I {{began to think that}} it must be an elopement, but I see the yacht's there still, and he would surely choose the yacht in {{preference}} to a motor-car, if he were running off <b>with</b> anybody! <b>Your</b> <b>husband</b> doesn't come into the rooms much?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} discuss that <b>with</b> you. Whether <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> was blind, or merely {{kept his eyes}} shut will not be decided by us. You have been warned. We will drop the subject now, if you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is," [...] {{acknowledged}} Nevis, {{who seemed to}} reflect. [...] "I got on <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> pleasantly, and I'm sorry in several ways that our connection has been broken off. I don't think the thing was any fault of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Jordan, [...] "is {{just what}} I was thinking, though it's quite likely {{there are people}} who wouldn't let it grieve them. In fact, I was {{wondering}} whether you would mind if I asked myself over to supper <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> this evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sweetest Milly, Bring your lovely face <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> to dine {{with us on}} Friday at seven--do. If not, I will be sulky {{with you}} till Sunday, when I shall be obliged to see you, and shall long to kiss you that very moment. Yours, {{according}} to your answer, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too just, madam, {{to require}} {{me to be}} thankful for the cold neglect <b>with</b> which <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> has uniformly treated me--neglect not unmingled with fixed aversion. You are too just, madam, to require me to be {{grateful}} for the constant and unceasing marks of scorn and malevolence with which I have been treated by others, or for such a homily as that <b>with</b> which <b>your</b> reverend chaplain has, at my expense, this very day regaled the assembled household." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you intend}} to leave it, and by what you gave me to understand, your {{departure}} must be impending. In fact, though you are still here in body, you are already absent in spirit. Your mind has taken up its residence <b>with</b> <b>your</b> prospective <b>husband,</b> and you might quite as well be lodged under the conjugal roof, for all the benefit we get from your society." ...|$|R
60|$|COLONEL. Well-well! Look here, old girl! It's my {{experience}} never to--what I mean is--never to trust {{too much to}} a man who has to do with mining. I've always refused {{to have anything to do}} <b>with</b> mines. If <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> were in England, of course, I'd say nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Lady Ruth," [...] he said, [...] "you {{may think}} {{so at this}} moment, but you are very much mistaken. What you really desire is a {{complete}} reconciliation <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> and {{a place in the}} great world which no one shall be able to question. These things are arranged for you; also--these." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will think}} twice before you direct me to do that. Here {{is a man who}} has not {{forgotten}} an item in our meetings at Rainbarrow: he is in company <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> Which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy-party was by chance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, but {{you talk}} of a painful {{difference}} of opinion <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> and then, when I ask {{for information on the}} point, you bring out a valise. And only a few moments ago you reproached me for not being serious. I wonder who is the serious person of us two now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe there}} can be no doubt that you are {{lawfully}} my son's wife," [...] Mrs. Macallan answered. [...] "At any rate it is easy to take a legal opinion on the subject. If the opinion is that you are not lawfully married, my son (whatever his faults and failings may be) is a gentleman. He is incapable of willfully deceiving a woman who loves and trusts him. He will do you justice. On my side, I will do you justice, too. If the legal opinion is adverse to your rightful claims, I will promise to answer any questions which you may choose to put to me. As it is, I believe you to be lawfully my son's wife; and I say again, make the best of your position. Be satisfied <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> affectionate devotion to you. If you value your peace of mind and the happiness of your life to come, abstain from attempting to know more than you know now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Under another cover I am {{sending you}} a fairy play {{entitled}} [...] "For [...] Love of the King," [...] just {{for your own}} amusement. It is the outcome [...] of long and luminous talks <b>with</b> <b>your</b> distinguished <b>husband</b> in the [...] Temple and on the river, {{in the days when}} I was meditating writing a [...] novel as beautiful and as intricate as a Persian praying-rug. I [...] hope that I have caught the atmosphere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, God forbid!--for it's {{exactly as}} a woman of {{imagination}} that I speak. There's no {{moment of my life}} at which I'm not imagining something; and it's thanks to that, darling," [...] Mrs. Assingham pursued, [...] "that I figure the sincerity <b>with</b> which <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> whom you see as viciously occupied <b>with</b> <b>your</b> stepmother, is interested, is tenderly interested, in his admirable, adorable wife." [...] She paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefit of this--as to Maggie's measure of which, however, no sign came; and then, poor woman, haplessly, she crowned her effort.--"He wouldn't hurt a hair of your head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly!" [...] {{and the man}} laughed. [...] "Only he {{went away}} again, or we wouldn't have come on here. Now, there are {{four or five of}} us, and we want a word <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> and mean to have it. It's not going to take us two minutes to find out if he's in the house." ...|$|E
60|$|LESLIE. Your {{place is}} with me--is <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> With me, with me; {{and for his}} sake most of all. What can you do for him alone? how can you help him alone? It wrings my heart to think how little. But {{together}} is different. Together...! Join my strength, my will, my courage to your own, and together we may save him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} to reason <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> and {{to persuade him}} to cease from his obstinacy, and to {{surrender}} to me the secret of the hiding-place of Brant's hoard. In that event, so soon as I have proved the truth of what he tells me, I undertake that he shall be set at liberty unharmed, and that, meanwhile, he shall be well treated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We all," [...] the Duchess continued, [...] "look upon <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> arrival as inopportune and unfortunate. We are {{all agreed}} that you must be kept apart. Certain {{obligations}} have been laid upon you. You could not possibly fulfil them <b>with</b> a <b>husband</b> at <b>your</b> elbow. The matter will be put plainly before <b>your</b> <b>husband,</b> as I am now putting it before you. He will be warned not to attempt to see or communicate <b>with</b> you as <b>your</b> <b>husband.</b> If he or you disobey the consequences will be serious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he begged, with {{a sudden}} change of voice. [...] "If I am mistaken in your husband--and {{there is always the}} chance--I am sorry. I will confess that I myself had a {{different}} opinion of him, but I can only judge from what I have seen and from that there is no one in the world who would not agree <b>with</b> me that <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> is unworthy of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] he went {{on after}} a pause, for Suzanne {{answered}} nothing, [...] "standing before you as I do here <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>husband's</b> blood upon my hands, and seeking your love over his grave, you will {{look at me and}} say--'This man is a monster, a madman, one who should be cast from the earth and stamped deep, deep into hell!' Yes, all these things I am, and let the weight of them rest upon your head, for you made me them, Suzanne. I am mad, I know that I am mad, as my father and grandfather were before me, but my madness is mixed with knowledge, for in me runs the blood of the old Pondo witch-doctoress, my grandmother, she who knew many things that are not given to white men. When I saw you and loved you I became half mad--before that I was sane--and when the Englishman, Kenzie, struck me with the whip after our fight at the sheep-kraal, ah! then I went wholly mad, and see how wisely, for you are the first-fruits of my madness, you and the body that to-night rolls to and fro in the ocean.|$|R
