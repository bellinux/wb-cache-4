5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees <b>were</b> <b>planted</b> along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E

During the 1970s, quarrying was halted, {{the land was}} reclaimed, and thousands of pine trees <b>were</b> <b>planted.</b> The area has since been used for recreation, including hiking, orienteering, and mountain biking. Brushes Clough Reservoir was constructed in the 19th century by the Oldham County Borough Council, using stone quarried from this site. The area is now managed by United Utilities.|$|E
5|$|Historically, California Zinfandel vines <b>were</b> <b>planted</b> {{as a field}} blend {{interspersed}} with Durif (Petite Sirah), Carignan, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines. Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11% of California's vineyard land area. Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot.|$|E

One tree was planted on the north side and the second tree on the south side of the {{building}} to reinforce the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.|$|E

50|$|After {{the last}} {{expected}} frost in spring, the <b>plants</b> can <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> out into their final positions. In their first winter outdoors, a frost protection is required.

5|$|In Australia, three {{cuttings}} of Carménère were {{imported from}} Chile by renowned viticultural expert Dr Richard Smart {{in the late}} 1990s. After two years in quarantine, only one cutting survived the heat treatment to eliminate viruses and was micro-propagated (segments of individual buds grown on nutrient gel) and field grown by Narromine Vine Nursery.

5|$|In May 2000, twenty trees <b>were</b> <b>planted,</b> one {{for each}} boys who attended. During the {{planting}} ceremony, the Scout Chief Commissioner for England, along {{with representatives of the}} Scouts and the Guides, planted the trees on the seaward side of the original site.

This municipality has been known as the “VEGETABLE BOWL OF THE NORTH”. The total value of vegetable production alone is PhP 523.04 million that brings a lot of income to farmers.|$|R
5|$|Irrigation made it {{possible}} to grow grapes for wine. The first grapes <b>were</b> <b>planted</b> at Hanwood in the spring of 1913 by John James McWilliam and his eldest son Jack who had come to the district from their winery in Junee. Irrigation was by carting of water until the irrigation channels were opened a few months later. The first grapes were picked in 1916 and sent to Junee for processing. Penfolds established their winery in the region in 1919.|$|E
