2500|$|Many reviewers {{liked the}} game but couldn't {{recommend}} it due to bugs and the obvious unfinishedness of it. Many said Rust had potential. Matt Purslow, (PCGamesN) {{wrote in his}} review of Rust he was positive it will be worth the wait even if it's the end of 2015 before it's better than what {{it was at the}} beginning of 2014. His verdict was to wait. Matthew Cox (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) said it was good that the developers switched to the Unity engine in late 2014 due to the instability of the game. He found many glitches in the late 2014 version, including unresponsive animals, framerate issues and sometimes servers would randomly disconnect him. Cox said Rust had potential, and the performance issues had been regularly acknowledged in the dev blogs. Rob Zacny (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) said there was more respect and cooperation in the community, compared to what there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> [...] He said that after a few deaths, playing seems tedious and [...] "starts to feel like it [...] might be a punishment, rather than a goal".|$|E
2500|$|Williams, {{the world}} number two, {{was the highest}} ranked player to lose in the round when he lost 2–5 against Michael Judge. In the fifth frame, at 2–2, Williams was 64–0 ahead but a black ball {{clearance}} of 70 gave Judge the lead, {{who went on to}} win the match. After the match, Williams said that he was nowhere near the player he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> World number four and Masters champion Paul Hunter made breaks of 108 and 127 in defeating Darren Morgan 5–3. European Open winner Stephen Maguire defeated Murphy 5–2, a match in which Maguire had a frame docked. As the match was about to begin and after they had shaken hands, Maguire realised he had not brought his [...] with him. He asked for permission to retrieve it from referee Johan Oomen, which was granted. As Maguire was away, Murphy spoke to the referee and questioned whether Maguire should be docked a frame, as he was technically not ready to play at the scheduled time. Mike Ganley, the tournament director, was called and docked a frame from Maguire, a ruling which angered Maguire. Of the incident Maguire said [...] "Rules are rules but I've never heard of anything like that happening before." [...] The incident was said to be a key point in the rivalry between Maguire and Murphy.|$|E

It was opened by his housekeeper, Mrs. Reid, a thin and saturnine old woman, who reminded and still reminds me of a reanimated mummy. She told me that the Professor was in, but had a gentleman to dinner, and suggested sourly that I should call again the next morning. With difficulty I persuaded her at last to inform her master that an old Egyptian friend had brought him something which he certainly would like to see.|$|E

60|$|But it {{was some}} time before Mary {{recovered}} her brightness. The changes which {{the last few months}} had made almost depressed her. It <b>was</b> but <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> that John and she had been boy and girl, together; now he had become a man, had done great deeds, was looked upon by many as one chosen for the deliverance of the nation. Mary felt that she, too, had aged; but the change in her was as nothing to that in her old playfellow.

Then being but a heathen, she could have met her end with all a heathen's strength, knowing what she lost, and believing, too, that she would find but sleep. And now it was otherwise, for in her heart she did not believe that she was about utterly to perish. What, could the body live on in a {{thousand}} forms, changed indeed but indestructible and immortal, while the spiritual part, with all its hopes and loves and fears, melted into nothingness? It could not be; surely on some new shore she should once again greet her love. And if it was not, how would they meet her in that under world, coming self-murdered, her life-blood on her hands? Would her mother turn away from her? and the little brother, whom she had loved, would he reject her? And what Voice of Doom might strike her into everlasting hopelessness? ...|$|E
60|$|So when {{everything}} {{was all right}} with Uncle William, Mr. Peters and I were married {{and it was on}} our wedding morning that Uncle conferred the Order on my husband which made me very proud. That <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> and since then we have lived in a very fine place of our own with four rooms, all to ourselves, and a gallery at the back. I have cooked all the meals and done all the work of our apartment, except just at the time when our little boy was born. We both think he is a very wonderful child. At first I wanted to call him after the Hohenzollerns and to name him William Frederick Charles Mary Augustus Francis Felix, but somehow it seemed out of place and so we have called him simply Joe Peters. I think it sounds better. Uncle William drew up an act of abnegation of Joe, whereby he gives up all claim to a reversion of the throne of Prussia, Brunswick and Waldeck. I was sorry for this at first but Uncle said that all the Hohenzollerns had done it and had made just as great a sacrifice as Joe has in doing it. But my husband says that under the constitution of the United States, Joe can be President, which I think I will like better.|$|E
60|$|That <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and since}} then I have only heard {{the history of the}} smoking-table in fragments. My brother liked it immensely; but he thought it was too luxurious for a married man, so he sent it to Reynolds, in Edinburgh. Not knowing Reynolds, I cannot say what his opinion was; but soon {{afterward}} I heard of its being in the possession of Grayson, who was charmed with it, but gave it to Pelle, because it was hardly in its place in a bachelor's establishment. Later a town man sent it to a country gentleman as just the thing for the country; and it was afterward in Liverpool as the very thing for a town. There I thought it was lost, so far as I was concerned. One day, however, Boyd, {{a friend of mine who}} lives in Glasgow, came to me for a week, and about six hours afterward he said that he had a present for me. He brought it into my sitting-room--a bulky parcel--and while he was undoing the cords he told me it was something quite novel; he had bought it in Glasgow the day before. When I saw a walnut leg I started; in another two minutes I was trying to thank Boyd for my own smoking-table. I recognized it by the dents. I was too much the gentleman to insist on an explanation from Boyd; but, though it seems a harsh thing to say, my opinion is that these different persons gave the table away because they wanted to get rid of it. William John has it now.|$|E
