30|$|The {{synchronization}} {{design for}} OFDM-based systems {{has been researched}} for years. Many methods have <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> for normal OFDM systems [3 - 7]. Although some experiences of normal OFDM systems can be developed for MB-OFDM UWB systems, most methods for normal OFDM systems cannot {{be used for the}} MB-OFDM UWB system directly due to some special features of MB-OFDM UWB such as the frequency hopping and low power spectral density (PSD). By considering the special features of MB-OFDM UWB, many effective methods have <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> specially for MB-OFDM UWB systems [8 - 18]. A cross-correlation (CC)-based method <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> in [8] for TFC identification. Some methods [10 - 12, 14] <b>are</b> <b>proposed</b> for packet detection. In [11], a sign-bit CC algorithm <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to simplify the operation of the normal CC. The sign-bit CC algorithm is further simplified in [12]. Some methods [13, 15, 17] focus on symbol timing. In [15], a method <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to distinguish the first significant multipath. Some methods for carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation <b>are</b> <b>proposed</b> in [14, 16, 18]. The method in [16] <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> based on the best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) principle, which has a high performance. However, these methods all focus on optimizing the implementation complexity or performance of individual functions, and none of them offer optimization on the power consumption of a comprehensive synchronization process.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} new algorithms for the deterministic global optimization {{of general}} non-linear programming problems (NLPs). It is proven that the αBB general underestimator may provide exact lower bounds on a function only if rigorous conditions are satisfied. These conditions are derived and the μ-subenergy methodology <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to achieve tighter αBB underestimation {{when they are}} violated. An interval lower bounding test <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to improve αBB lower bounds and avoid expensive algorithmic steps. Piecewise-linear relaxations (PLR) <b>are</b> <b>proposed</b> for the underestimation of general functions. Calculation of these relaxations is accelerated using parallel computing. Quality bounds tightening (QBT) <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> {{to reduce the cost}} of bounds tightening algorithms by avoiding unnecessary calculations. Violation branching <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to improve the performance of branching strategies by considering constraint violation when selecting a branching variable. Furthermore, a novel bounds tightening method, PLR bounds tightening (PLR-BT), <b>is</b> <b>proposed.</b> Variable-based convexity (VBC) <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> as a general reformulation algorithm, to build tighter relaxations by exploiting underlying convexity. This work also introduces algorithms for parallel branching for the global solution of NLPs. A parallel node subdivision strategy, Multisection Branching, <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to achieve tighter bounds, and a parallel node selection strategy, Future Branching, <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to accelerate the investigation of the branch-and-bound tree. A parallel solver is presented, where MPI is used to distribute node calculations and an asynchronous bounds tightening algorithm <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> to reduce bounds tightening wall times. This algorithm is implemented using multithreading for asynchronous feasibility-based bounds tightening (AF-BBT). All algorithms are implemented in a global solver, and its parallel architecture and features are described. This solver is used to perform numerical studies on the benefits of using the new algorithms in tandem. The new solver is benchmarked against the BARON 15. 9. 22 global solver for a set of problems, in which it achieves comparable performance. Open Acces...|$|R
