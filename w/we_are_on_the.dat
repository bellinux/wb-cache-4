[...] "Smooth Criminal"'s {{recalled}} [...] "the popcorn-chomping manner" [...] of [...] "Thriller". The track was thought of {{as an example of}} [...] "Jackson's free-form language" [...] that keeps people [...] "aware that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of several realities: the film, the dream it inspires, the waking world it illuminates". The music in [...] "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", a duet with Siedah Garrett, consisted mainly of finger snaps and timpani.

[...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"'s music consisted of blues harmonies. The lyrics of [...] "Another Part of Me" [...] deal with being united, as [...] "we".|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the plan {{is that it is}} not victim-centric and that its support for victims is insufficient. Bethany Hastie of McGill University said that the HTNCC had a good track record of intelligence assessment and awareness-raising with respect to human trafficking, and she therefore approved of the plan's funding of the HTNCC. She was critical of the plan's emphasis on law enforcement, saying that [...] "the crime-fighting focus of the plan has unfortunately detracted from...victim services." [...] She said that more attention to victim services was necessary because most Canadian provinces were employing only ad-hoc methods of supporting victims, often omitting important elements such as legal aid and situation-appropriate shelter. A few weeks after the establishment of the NAP-CHT, Dean Allison, MP for Niagara West—Glanbrook, Ontario travelled to Cambodia and Thailand to learn more about human trafficking as part of a parliamentary delegation with World Vision Canada, and he said that his meetings there convinced him [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right track in Canada with our National Action Plan." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the words}} of Nicholas C. Pano, [...] "Khrushchev {{attempted}} to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting {{for the purpose of}} securing the condemnation of the Chinese" [...] with Kapo being the only representative of a European party [...] "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end." [...] During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, [...] "When you make your speech at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as we have all agreed.'...

500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

Robinson was arrested and charged for his part in the incident. Paisley and many loyalist supporters travelled south to support him during his court appearance in Dundalk. Their singing of loyalist songs outside the courthouse led to rioting, causing Paisley and Robinson to lodge a formal complaint with the Foreign Office about what they said was inadequate protection.|$|E
