500|$|... "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] was {{released}} as the B-side to [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] on December 2, 1968. The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how nice it is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1975 {{federal and}} state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, {{had been hit by}} a series of {{economic}} problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode {{due to a lack of}} cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: [...] "My Government is being smeared and it hurts. They <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we are to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single was [...] "Moto Psycho", and a {{video was}} also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, {{spending}} a lot of time on the road. [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E
60|$|Lastly, for the Soldan himself. In {{a modern}} work, you would assuredly have had him staring at St. Francis with his eyebrows up, or {{frowning}} thunderously at his Magi, with them bent as far down {{as they would}} go. Neither of these aspects does he bear, according to Giotto. A perfect gentleman and king, he looks on his Magi with quiet eyes of decision; he is much the noblest person in the room--though an infidel, the true hero of the scene, far more than St. Francis. It is evidently the Soldan whom Giotto <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of mainly, in this picture of Christian missionary work.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Rand's long-time {{associate}} Mary Ann Sures remarked: Some {{critics have}} tried to turn her certainty into a desire on her part to be an authority in the bad sense, and they accuse her of being dogmatic, of demanding unquestioning agreement and blind loyalty. They have tried, but none successfully, to make her into {{the leader of a}} cult, and followers of her philosophy into cultists who accept without thinking everything she says. This is a most unjust accusation; it's really perverse. Unquestioning agreement is precisely what Ayn Rand did not <b>want.</b> She <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and act independently, not to accept conclusions because she said so, but because you reached them by using your mind in an independent and firsthand manner.|$|R

2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{for a moment that}} I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1978 {{edition of}} a book that {{traditionally}} promoted an unfavourable view on Harrison's work, , authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described Thirty Three & ⅓ as Harrison's [...] "best effort – by far" [...] since All Things Must Pass. Carr and Tyler concluded: [...] "It must be the production. For no individual track really presents itself as typifying a New Harrison Approach – and yet the impression left by the album {{as a whole is}} definitely of a more balanced, poised and devil-may-care Hari..." [...] Robert Christgau, another critic with a low regard for Harrison's music, gave Thirty Three & ⅓ the highest rating of all the ex-Beatle's solo albums thus far, with a [...] "B–". Christgau wrote, [...] "This isn't as worldly as George <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> – or as he thinks himself, for all I know – but it ain't fulla shit either", and he highlighted [...] "Crackerbox Palace" [...] as Harrison's best song since [...] "Here Comes the Sun".|$|R
