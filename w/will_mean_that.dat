Both towers are connected by a bridge, one floor above the plaza level, and are also connected by basement levels beneath the plaza level. At these levels will be a variety of commercial and hotel accommodation with entrances from street level and the new public square. The towers are topped by two storeys of plant rooms. The communication equipment and maintenance equipment will generally be below the parapet level so that there is an uncluttered roof line. The designs for the towers were inspired by the products of the jewellery and crafts industry in the nearby Jewellery Quarter. The bridge across the plaza level <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the entrance to the two towers is completely covered from all weather.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{argument}} for incompatibilism {{is that of}} the [...] "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in [...] "voluntary" [...] behavior. They insist, rather, <b>that</b> free <b>will</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> man must be the [...] "ultimate" [...] or [...] "originating" [...] cause of his actions. He must be causa sui, in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause <b>means</b> <b>that</b> there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will. This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.|$|R

40|$|There {{is minimal}} {{dialogue}} {{in the research}} literature between the arts and literacy, what does exist tends to privilege one over the other. This chapter presents {{a call to action}} - one that offers a more productive and encouraging relationship between the two concepts. It is recommended that a more refined definition of literacy is needed by acknowledging that multimodality and creativity are inherent in the ways in which we communicate, make decisions and ultimately learn and teach. It is also suggested that a different pedagogical approach to the learning and teaching of literacy in schools is endorsed. It is clear that many developed countries place significant importance on the results from standardised tests and that this approach is impacting on teachers' pedagogical practice. Encouraging a positive relationship between arts practice and literate practice <b>will</b> essentially <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> literacy <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> much more than what is verified through high-stakes testing.
