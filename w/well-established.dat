5|$|Almost all {{globular}} clusters have a half-light radius {{of less than}} 10 pc, although there are <b>well-established</b> {{globular clusters}} with very large radii (i.e. NGC 2419 (Rh = 18 pc) and Palomar 14 (Rh = 25 pc)).|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} the {{development}} of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from <b>well-established</b> thinkers working on similar problems.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} used for herbal remedies, with <b>well-established</b> {{emollient}} and astringent properties. Mullein remedies are especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in topical applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant has also been used to make dyes and torches.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that American Bison began a {{periodic}} east–west trek through Indiana, crossing the Falls of the Ohio and the Wabash River near modern-day Vincennes. These herds became important to civilizations in southern Indiana and created a <b>well-established</b> Buffalo Trace, later used by European-American pioneers moving west.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm in {{non-human}} mammals is a <b>well-established</b> but {{not widely}} known phenomenon. Its study under zoo or laboratory conditions {{could lead to}} a better understanding of self-harm in human patients.|$|E
5|$|Storytelling is {{an ancient}} custom in Somali culture. Love of cinema in Somalia is but a modern, visual {{incarnation}} and continuation of this <b>well-established</b> oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is <b>well-established</b> in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} shrine is the Chhinnamasta Temple near Rajrappa in Jharkhand, where {{a natural}} rock covered with an ashtadhatu (eight-metal alloy) kavacha (cover) is worshipped as the goddess. Though <b>well-established</b> as a centre of Chhinnamasta by the 18th century, {{the site is}} a popular place of worship among tribals since ancient times. Kheer and animal sacrifice are offered to the goddess.|$|E
5|$|Another {{trend in}} {{contemporary}} Danish architecture is {{the emergence of}} a new generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends than by the modernist tradition in Scandinavia. The generation is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) founded in 2006 has made an unusually rapid transition into a <b>well-established</b> firm.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1842 Dickens began {{publishing}} {{his novel}} Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial; although the novel was his favourite work, sales had been disappointing and he faced financial difficulties. By {{this time he was}} a <b>well-established</b> author, having written six major works, as well as several short stories, novellas and other works.|$|E
5|$|Besides these, {{the state}} is home to Kalyani University, The University of Burdwan, Vidyasagar University, and North Bengal Universityall <b>well-established</b> and nationally renownedto cover {{education}} needs at the district level and an Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata. Apart from this there is a private university run by the Ramakrishna mission named Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University at Belur Math.|$|E
5|$|Formed in 1930 {{through the}} merger of two <b>well-established</b> British music businesses, the company {{controls}} the copyrights to much major, 20th-century music, including works by Bernstein, Britten, Copland, Prokofieff, Strauss and Stravinsky. It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers, including John Adams, Louis Andriessen, Harrison Birtwistle, Anna Clyne, Osvaldo Golijov, James MacMillan, and Steve Reich.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian volcanoes {{follow a}} <b>well-established</b> {{life cycle of}} growth and erosion. After a new volcano forms, its lava output {{gradually}} increases. Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E
5|$|In Poland, notable {{imports from}} Arabia {{included}} those of Prince Hieronymous Sanguszko (1743–1812), {{who founded the}} Slawuta stud. Poland's first state-run Arabian stud farm, Janów Podlaski, was established by the decree of Alexander I of Russia in 1817, and by 1850, the great stud farms of Poland were <b>well-established,</b> including Antoniny, owned by the Polish Count Potocki (who had married into the Sanguszko family); later notable as the farm that produced the stallion Skowronek.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being divided by {{the inner and outer}} walls, which created an urban core occupied by the site's foremost buildings and areas of occupation between and outside of the outer wall, Gedi has a <b>well-established</b> infrastructure. Gedi's structures appear to be formally arranged in accordance with streets laid out in a grid pattern. Additionally the site contained sumps to collect storm water and lavatories in many of its primary buildings.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} {{technologies such}} as the Paraho Direct are thermally efficient, since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the retort. These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two <b>well-established</b> shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, {{and a number of}} Chinese companies operate Fushun process facilities.|$|E
5|$|Islam {{was also}} <b>well-established</b> {{throughout}} China, {{with a history}} said to have begun with Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas during the Tang dynasty and strong official support during the Yuan. Although the Ming sharply curtailed this support, there were still several prominent Muslim figures early on, including the Hongwu Emperor's generals Chang Yuqun, Lan Yu, Ding Dexing, and Mu Ying, {{as well as the}} Yongle Emperor's powerful eunuch Zheng He.|$|E
5|$|It became common {{knowledge}} among the settlers that their European vines, of the vinifera. variety, simply would not grow in American soil, and they resorted to growing Native American plants, and established plantations of these native vines. Exceptions did exist; vinifera plantations were <b>well-established</b> in California before the aphids {{found their way}} there.|$|E
5|$|Kidd {{identifies}} Moss Side, Longsight, Cheetham Hill, Rusholme, as centres {{of population}} for ethnic minorities. Manchester's Irish Festival, including a St Patrick's Day parade, {{is one of}} Europe's largest. There is also a <b>well-established</b> Chinatown in the city with {{a substantial number of}} oriental restaurants and Chinese supermarkets. The area also attracts large numbers of Chinese students to the city who, in attending the local universities, contribute to Manchester having the third-largest Chinese population in Europe.|$|E
5|$|McAleer, however, contributed {{little to}} this outcome. In 1901, {{he played in}} only three games with the Blues. The AL, {{established}} in 1900 by Ban Johnson, {{former president of the}} Western League, was by this time in direct competition with the <b>well-established</b> National League (NL). McAleer, a close friend of Johnson and his associate, Charles Comiskey, {{played a significant role in}} the new league's development, recruiting scores of experienced players from the NL.|$|E
5|$|Non-SI units whose {{values in}} SI units must be {{obtained}} experimentally (Table 7). This list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and in astronomy {{such as the}} dalton, the electron mass, the electron volt, the astronomical unit, the solar mass, {{and a number of}} other units of measure that are <b>well-established,</b> but dependent on experimentally-determined physical quantities.|$|E
5|$|Silicon-germanium alloys {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} an important semiconductor material for high-speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilizing {{the properties of}} Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone. Silicon-germanium is beginning to replace gallium arsenide (GaAs) in wireless communications devices. The SiGe chips, with high-speed properties, {{can be made with}} low-cost, <b>well-established</b> production techniques of the silicon chip industry.|$|E
5|$|Since his debut, Wario {{has become}} the protagonist and antihero of the Wario Land and WarioWare series, {{spanning}} handheld and console markets. In addition to appearances in spin-offs in the Mario series, he appears in cameos for Kirby Super Star Ultra, Densetsu no Stafy 3 and Pilotwings 64. He has also been featured in other media such as the Super Mario Adventures graphic novel. The character has received a largely positive critical reception and {{has emerged as a}} <b>well-established</b> mascot for Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|The Forbeses were a <b>well-established</b> Aberdeenshire family, {{holders of}} both a barony and a baronetcy. The baronetcy had been {{bestowed}} in 1630, and was restricted to heirs male. In 1884 Sir William Forbes, the eighth baronet, inherited his cousin Maria's title as Lord Sempill and took the surname of Forbes-Sempill. On William's death in 1905, both titles passed to his eldest son, John.|$|E
5|$|The film {{revolves}} around a <b>well-established</b> software systems architect, Sivaji, who returns home to India after finishing {{work in the}} United States. On his return, he dreams of {{giving back to society}} with free medical treatment and education. However his plans face a roadblock {{in the form of the}} influential businessman, Adiseshan. When corruption also arises, Sivaji is left with no option but to fight the system in his own way.|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through <b>well-established</b> morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
5|$|To the band's consternation, {{they were}} forced to cancel their {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Jenner and Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist– a meeting he did not attend. He was sent to relax in the sun on the Spanish island of Formentera with Waters and Sam Hutt (a doctor <b>well-established</b> in the underground music scene), but this led to no visible improvement.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of phylogenetic {{taxonomy}} in vertebrate paleontology, Tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions. The original was produced by Paul Sereno in 1998, and included all tyrannosauroids closer to Tyrannosaurus than to either Alectrosaurus, Aublysodon or Nanotyrannus. However, Nanotyrannus is often {{considered to be a}} juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex, while Aublysodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium unsuitable for use in the definition of a clade. Definitions since then have been based on more <b>well-established</b> genera.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a <b>well-established</b> subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from <b>well-established</b> suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from <b>well-established</b> racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no <b>well-established</b> writing system for ASL, written sign {{language}} dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a <b>well-established</b> phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a <b>well-established</b> franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team {{approached}} after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E
5|$|Born François-Marie Arouet, Voltaire (1694–1778), by {{the time}} of the Lisbon earthquake, was already a <b>well-established</b> author, known for his satirical wit. He had been made a member of the Académie Française in 1746. He was a deist, a strong proponent of {{religious}} freedom, and a critic of tyrannical governments. Candide became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political and artistic works expressing these views. More specifically, it was a model for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the contes philosophiques. This genre, of which Voltaire was one of the founders, included previous works of his such as Zadig and Micromegas.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was <b>well-established</b> did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E
