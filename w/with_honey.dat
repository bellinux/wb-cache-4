5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end <b>with</b> <b>honey</b> cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled <b>with</b> <b>honey,</b> and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E
5|$|After Passover, {{the celebration}} of Mimouna takes place, a {{tradition}} brought to Israel by the Jewish communities of North Africa. In the evening, a feast of fruit, confectionery and pastries is set out for neighbors and visitors to enjoy. Most notably, the first leaven after Passover, a thin crepe called a mofletta, eaten <b>with</b> <b>honey,</b> syrup or jam, is served. The occasion is celebrated the following day by outdoor picnics at which salads and barbecued meat feature prominently.|$|E

5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder causes {{significant economic}} losses because many agricultural crops (although no staple foods) worldwide are pollinated by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{the worth of}} global crops <b>with</b> <b>honey</b> bee pollination was estimated at close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the US have increased the cost to farmers renting them for pollination services by up to 20%.|$|E
5|$|Cubeb reached Africa {{by way of}} the Arabs. In Moroccan cuisine, cubeb is used in savory {{dishes and}} in {{pastries}} like markouts, little diamonds of semolina <b>with</b> <b>honey</b> and dates. It also appears occasionally in the list of ingredients for the famed spice mixture Ras el hanout. In Indonesian cuisine, especially in Indonesian gulés (curries), cubeb is frequently used.|$|E

Awareness of the film was increased by its February 2000 release as a pay-per-view title, which also increased traffic to the film's web site.|$|E

5|$|The highway passes some {{homes and}} forests north of Dunnstown, {{entering}} Woodward Township soon after. At the intersection with Township Road 406, State Route 664 starts winding in several directions, but following a northward basis. This continues until the intersection with Arbutus Drive, where it heads {{straight to the}} northwest. At a clearing in a nearby forest, State Route 664 enters the community of Swissdale. The stay in the community is short, with the highway leaving after a few blocks. Just north of Swissdale, State Route 664 makes a long hairpin turn, curving {{from east to west}} before turning north once again. Just after the intersection <b>with</b> <b>Honey</b> Suckle Lane, State Route 664 progresses towards Haneyville.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated <b>with</b> <b>honey</b> which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked <b>with</b> <b>honey</b> to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E

5|$|A diurnal species (active mainly {{during the}} day), the meat ant shows minimal {{interaction}} with nocturnal ant species when their territories overlap. The meat ant {{and other members}} of the I. purpureus species group are regarded as a dominant group of diurnal species in Australia, as they are highly active, aggressive, and have an enormous geographical range. During the day, the bulk of the workers attend and feed on honeydew secreted by insects that live on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees. These trees are connected by foraging trails formed by meat ants, which also connect to satellite nests that are a part of a single colony; these trails are easily visible due to the absence of vegetation and lead to important food and water sources. Other workers in smaller numbers will often scavenge around the nest area for dead insects, or other proteinaceous foods to bring back to their colony. Their dominance is clear when meat ants are capable of finding food sources more successfully than most ants, capable of displacing many ants and other insects. Food sources are also discovered more rapidly and greatly reduces the foraging efficiency of other ants, including those of Iridomyrmex. However, some ants such as the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) are not affected by the presence of meat ants and are still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are general predators and forage singularly and cannot recruit other nestmates, they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They heavily rely on any food source and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to its peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants. This means green-head ants avoid conflict with meat ants. Certain myrmicines, which are highly competitive, are capable of defending themselves from foraging workers; the rapid recruitment of nestmates and the use of chemicals for defence allows them to withstand attacks from meat ants. In particular, Monomorium ants have been observed occupying baits regardless of the presence or absence of the meat ant. This is not the case with mealworms, but they have moderate success <b>with</b> <b>honey</b> baits. In foraging areas where meat ants are excluded or not present, the number of other ants observed is far greater and activity dramatically increases. However, the presence of meats ants does not affect abundant species, and most of the time it is only Iridomyrmex ants that increase their foraging rate.|$|E

This {{product is}} based on Manuka <b>honey,</b> <b>with</b> added {{honeybee}} venom, and is registered in New Zealand as a dietary supplement under {{the provisions of the}} Dietary Supplement Regulations 1985. Components of honeybee venom have an anti-inflammatory effect and market feedback has shown that customers derive benefits from taking Manuka <b>honey</b> <b>with</b> added bee venom to alleviate symptoms of arthritis. The active ingredient, the honeybee venom (20 µg venom/g honey), does contain known allergens, principally melittin and phospholipase A 2, consequently in this application an emphasis has been placed on showing that Manuka <b>honey</b> <b>with</b> added bee venom is safe at the suggested consumption level. An intake of two teaspoons of Manuka <b>honey</b> <b>with</b> added bee venom per day is equivalent to 20 g honey and 400 µg honeybee venom per day. This dosage (5. 3 µg/kg/day) is close to the dose that would be expected to be effective for a 75 kg adult from reported clinical studies. Manuka <b>honey</b> <b>with</b> added bee venom has been marketed to the arthritis segment of the New Zealand natural health market since its development in 1996. During this time, total sales of more than 13, 437, 000 individual 20 g doses of Manuka <b>honey</b> <b>with</b> added bee venom ha...|$|R
