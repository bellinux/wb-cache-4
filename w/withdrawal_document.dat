50|$|Abrupt or rapid {{discontinuation}} from etizolam, as with benzodiazepines, {{may result}} in {{the appearance of the}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, including rebound insomnia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare event in benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal,</b> has been <b>documented</b> in a case of abrupt withdrawal from etizolam. This is particularly relevant given etizolam's short half life relative to benzodiazepines such as diazepam resulting in a more rapid drug level decrease in blood plasma levels.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients 2 ̆ 7 charts {{have been}} a source of data for {{retrospective}} studies of the quality of end-of-life care. In the intensive care unit, most patients die after withdrawal of life support. Chart reviews of this process could be used not only to assess the quality of documentation but also to provide information for quality improvement and research. OBJECTIVE: To assess the documentation of end-of-life care of patients and their families by care providers {{in the intensive care unit}}. METHOD: Charts of 50 adult patients who died in the intensive care unit at a large midwestern hospital after initiation of withdrawal of life support (primarily mechanical ventilation) were reviewed. A form developed for the study was used for data collection. RESULTS: The initiation of the decision making for <b>withdrawal</b> was <b>documented</b> in all 50 charts. Sixteen charts (32...|$|R
40|$|Information was {{collected}} in 1993 from students who withdrew from courses in mid-term {{at a community}} college either because they were dropping a course or departing from the college. This report <b>documents</b> <b>withdrawal</b> patterns of students during the calendar year of 1994. Self-reported reasons for course/college withdrawal were identified and differences in withdrawal patterns across gender, ethnic, age groups, and academic curricula were identified. A Student Withdrawal Form, which is appended, was used to gather information on 15, 918 withdrawals. Findings included: compared to actual enrollments, students withdrew from courses in the natural and physical sciences at a disproportionate rate, and mathematics represented the largest number of students within this group; allied health and public service had much lower withdrawal rates than their enrollments would suggest; when students withdrew fro...|$|R
50|$|Disturbances {{in mental}} {{function}} can persist {{for several months}} or years after withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Psychotic depression persisting {{for more than a}} year following benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> has been <b>documented</b> in the medical literature. The patient had no prior psychiatric history. The symptoms reported in the patient included, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, including persistent depressed mood, poor concentration, decreased appetite, insomnia, anhedonia, anergia and psychomotor retardation. The patient also experienced paranoid ideation (believing she was being poisoned and persecuted by co-employees), accompanied by sensory hallucinations. Symptoms developed after abrupt withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide and persisted for 14 months. Various psychiatric medications were trialed which were unsuccessful in alleviating the symptomatology. Symptoms were completely relieved by recommending chlordiazepoxide for irritable bowel syndrome 14 months later. Another case report, reported similar phenomenon in a female patient who abruptly reduced her diazepam dosage from 30 mg to 5 mg per day. She developed electric shock sensations, depersonalisation, anxiety, dizziness, left temporal lobe EEG spiking activity, hallucinations, visual perceptual and sensory distortions which persisted for years.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{groundwater}} <b>withdrawals</b> are well <b>documented</b> on a regional {{scale in the}} Lower Fox River Valley, southeastern Wisconsin, and Dane County. There have been substantial declines in groundwater levels in these three areas. In August of 2007, six suburban communities in the Lower Fox Valley reduced consumption of groundwater by about 8. 2 million gallons per day by switching to surface water supplied by pipeline from Lake Michigan. As a result, water levels in the deep sandstone aquifer near Green Bay have risen. The WGNHS determined that so far, water levels have risen more than 150 feet in certain places (Luczaj, 2009). Although the water levels are approaching a new stable level, a smaller additional rise is expected. The USGS and the WGNHS maintain a water level network of wells across the state. In April 2012, the water levels in one such well, located in the deep sandstone {{just north of the}} City of Green Bay, reached their highest point since measurements began in 1952. See als...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic stripe {{cards are}} in common use for {{electronic}} payments and cash <b>withdrawal.</b> Reported incidents <b>document</b> that criminals easily pickpocket cards or skim them by swiping them through additional card readers. Personal identi. cation numbers (PINs) are obtained by shoulder surfing, {{through the use}} of mirrors or concealed miniature cameras. Both elements, the PIN and the card, are generally sufficient to give the criminal full access to the victim's account. In this paper, we present alternative PIN entry methods to which we refer as cognitive trapdoor games. These methods make it significantly harder for a criminal to obtain PINs even if he fully observes the entire input and output of a PIN entry procedure. We also introduce the idea of probabilistic cognitive trapdoor games, which offer resilience to shoulder surfing even if the criminal records a PIN entry procedure with a camera. We studied the security as well as the usability of our methods. The result support the hypothesis that our primary mechanism strikes a balance between security and usability that is of practical value. In this article, we give a detailed account of our mechanisms and their evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, taking {{blood samples}} {{from a human}} forearm and using Cephalic, Basilic, and Median Cubital veins to perform various {{injections}} {{can be considered as}} one of the most routine medical procedures for diagnostic purposes. Most human patients don’t need to waste a lot of time in clinics waiting for the nurses and/or doctors to locate an applicable venipuncture site. However, minority of individuals who suffer from obesity, cancer, and other similar medical complications have to go to excruciating pain in order to provide the nurses with desired venipuncture sites. The goal of this project is to research and utilize an accurate, safe, and cost-effective instrument that is able to help doctors and nurses to locate an accurate and proper venipuncture site for injections and/or blood <b>withdrawals.</b> Using this <b>document,</b> I propose to provide an intensive research for high frequency/ultrasonic transducers. Such study will be used to present accurate measurements for a cost-effective vein detector/seeking prototype. This biomedical device utilizes a high frequency transducer to create and transmit sound waves that travel through various mediums in a human forearm and generates echo waves, each of which corresponding to a different layer through human skin, fat, and the actual vein. Using a microcontroller/microprocessor, such echo waves can be translated into digital signals, which in turn can locate the position of the needed vein...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the growth of cities and the rise of a {{merchant}} class in later medieval England, the desire for privacy began to emerge alongside an increase in personal consciousness. In my dissertation, I examine the place of privacy in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century England by juxtaposing elements of the private such as access, intimacy, and <b>withdrawal</b> in historical <b>documents</b> such as court records and marriage customs against canonical literature including, but not only, Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and Malory’s Le Morte Darthur. My study explains the dynamics between privacy and place in urban property, romance beds, marriage, and widowhood by utilizing a theoretical framework developed by modern geographers; expanding on their ideas, I consider how the locative, the material, and the social influenced people’s notions of privacy, and how the literature reflects those ideals. In these narratives, the way that people react to expectations of place, both geographical and social, simultaneously suggests a self-conscious political positioning and a rejection of the dominant ideology that determined proper behavior. In my research, I put court records, romances, and letters in conversation with one another to analyze an unexplored discourse on medieval privacy. My dissertation reshapes our understanding of medieval place, space, and identity and redefines the historical narrative by identifying privacy and individuality as cultural elements of the late Middle Ages.

40|$|Immunosuppression {{has been}} {{sporadically}} discontinued by noncompliant liver allograft recipients for whom an additional 4 1 / 2 years of follow-up is provided. These anecdotal observations prompted a previously reported prospective drug withdrawal program in 59 liver recipients. This prospective series has been increased to 95 patients whose weaning was begun between June 1992 and March 1996, 8. 4 ± 4. 4 (SD) years after liver replacement. A further 4 1 / 2 years follow-up was obtained of the 5 self-weaned patients. The prospectively weaned recipients (93 livers; 2 liver/kidney) had undergone transplantation under immunosuppression based on azathioprine (AZA, through 1979), cyclosporine (CsA, 1980 - 1989), or tacrolimus (TAC, 1989 - 1994). In patients on CsA or TAC based cocktails, the adjunct drugs were weaned {{first in the}} early part of the trial. Since 1994, the T cell-directed drugs were weaned first. Three of the 5 original self-weaned recipients remain well after drug-free intervals of 14 to 17 years. A fourth patient died in a vehicular accident after 11 years off immunosuppression, and the fifth patient underwent retransplantation because of hepatitis C infection after 9 drug-free years; their allografts had no histopathologic evidence of rejection. Eighteen (19 %) of the 95 patients in the prospective series have been drug free for from 10 months to 4. 8 years. In the total group, 18 (19 %) have had biopsy proved acute rejection; 7 (7 %) had a presumed acute rejection without biopsy; 37 (39 %) are still weaning; and 12 (13 %, all well) were withdrawn from the protocol at reduced immunosuppression because of noncompliance (n= 8), recurrent PBC (n= 2), pregnancy (n= 1), and renal failure necessitating kidney transplantation (n= 1). No patients were formally diagnosed with chronic rejection, but 3 (3 %) were placed back on preexisting immunosuppression or switched from cyclosporine (CsA) to tacrolimus (TAC) because of histopathologic evidence of duct injury. Two patients with normal liver function died during the trial, both from complications of prior chronic immunosuppression. No grafts suffered permanent functional impairment and only one patient developed temporary jaundice. Long surviving liver transplant recipients are systematically overimmunosuppressed. Consequently, drug weaning, whether incomplete or complete, is an important management strategy providing it is done slowly under careful physician surveillance. Complete weaning from CsA-based regimens has been difficult.

40|$|Introduction: Mental or {{behavioral}} disorders due to alcohol were diagnosed in 2010 in Germany {{as the third}} most frequent single diagnosis in hospitals {{with a total of}} 333 357 cases demonstrating the relevance of alcohol dependency for the healthcare system. For the period of withdrawal treatment guidelines provide good guidance in the drug treatment of withdrawal symptoms and comorbid depression. In the so-called post-acute phase of treatment, however, very different treatment strategies including prescription of psychotropic can be observed in daily practice. This raises the question whether the decision to drug treatment is based on valid guidelines, or rather on the attitudes and personal convictions of the physician in charge. It can be assumed that often psychotropic drugs are prescribed. to such patients without a plausible rationale. This question was examined in our study. Methodology: The naturalistic study was performed in a restrictive unit for alcohol addicts certified according to DIN EN ISO 9001 / 2008 (Berlin Vivantes Klinikum AVK). 195 patients hospitalized for 12 weeks were prospectively monitored during the study period of 9 months. They were divided into two cohorts: In In group A the patients were treated for the entire duration of the observation period with at least one drug (usually an antidepressant), whereas in group B the patients were treated over the entire observation period without psychotropic compounds. In any other aspects treatment did not differ in the two groups. The indication for CNS drug treatment was checked a) by ICD 10 -oriented documentation of depressive symptoms at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the observation period, b) an evaluation of the individual treatment goals and c) a rating of the severity of withdrawal treatment. In 6 patients, a change in the treatment regime took place. These were excluded from the analysis, so that finally 189 patients were included into the data analysis. Results: Our initial expectation was not confirmed by the findings of this study. Overall in the medicated cases compared to the group without drug treatment a higher number of depressive symptoms (insomnia, anxiety, loss of enjoyment, increased fatigability) were observed. More severe symptoms of withdrawal during the acute <b>withdrawal</b> treatment were <b>documented.</b> Two aspects, however, were conspicuous: 1 : About 30 % of patients having been given psychotropic had similar initial symptoms of depression documented as those patients being left without any further medication. 2 : A subset of patients without medication showed fairly serious ICD 10 –based symptoms of depression initially with, however, good remission at the end of the observation period. Conclusion: In contrast to our initial hypothesis psychotropic (mostly antidepressant) medication of alcohol addicts during the cessation followed more or less the recommendations of existing guidelines. However, the question still remains unresolved how we could predict which individual patient would benefit from an antidepressant or other psychotropic medication...|$|R
