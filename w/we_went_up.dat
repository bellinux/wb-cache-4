6000|$|... "This is it. I wouldn't trust {{an express}} company to deliver it. Suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> {{to your room}} {{and see how the}} two look side by side." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> {{together}} {{to the room}} of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan {{of the room and}} the principal articles of furniture in it.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to Crosby's {{store and}} called Eddie outside. He {{looked to be}} estimable and freckled; and he had chills and fever when I made my proposition.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> a {{creaking}} outside {{staircase to}} his little office, {{and he showed}} off before me for a while, {{with one or two}} subordinates and the telephone.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rollo, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> {{close to}} it. But {{we did not}} touch it, for there was a notice put up that {{visitors}} must not touch the guns.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] Marina said, [...] "that if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to {{the flat}} roof, we may see {{something}} {{of what is going}} on. This house is more lofty than most." ...|$|R

6000|$|Leaving him {{standing}} there, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> {{to the top}} room. I tapped at the door, and a little shrill voice inside said, [...] "We are locked in. Mrs. Blinder's got the key!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. I wouldn't {{after the}} way he pitched into me. I didn't know if he would give it. And he wouldn't hear a word, so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to Rockstone to the house.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> and bade adieu to our mistress; {{she was in}} {{a dreadful}} state of {{agitation}} by this time, and that Bishop was with her whose company she was so fond of.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{would be}} able to learn our course by the current, and if it be not {{possible}} to find the boat, then must <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> the river to warn the volunteers." ...|$|R
6000|$|So he went home, {{and asked}} his wife {{what it would}} be best to do. [...] "We cannot have three seats together," [...] said he, [...] "unless <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> upon the banquette." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> {{the steps}} and into {{the cool of the}} great hall. There the soldier, whose every feeling had been outraged no doubt by Rinolfo's {{attitude}} towards his lord, ventured to express his sympathy and indignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it is. Suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up?</b> My sister can get me cards.... I tell you, Dare, I'd {{like to see}} what's {{going on}} in that bunch. I've heard a lot and seen some things." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{rain was}} {{beginning}} {{as they took}} their way over the meadow, and Wetherell was near to being bogged the first crack out of the box. [...] "Do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> that cliff?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said I. [...] "They're sure to stay {{all night}} if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to the house, and then I {{should have to}} have the tent and things hauled away, for I couldn't leave them here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wait a bit," [...] pleaded Mrs. Wragge. [...] "Wait a bit, miss, before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> any higher. I've got the Buzzing {{in my head}} {{worse than}} ever. Please wait for me till I'm a little better again." ...|$|R
