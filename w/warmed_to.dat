5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Although her father, {{manager and}} {{various members of}} her touring team {{reportedly}} tried to dissuade her, Winehouse performed at the Rock in Rio Lisboa festival in Portugal in May 2008. Although the set was plagued by a late arrival and problems with her voice, the crowd <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> her. In addition to her own material she performed two Specials covers. Winehouse performed at Nelson Mandela's 90th Birthday Party concert at London's Hyde Park on 27 June, {{and the next day}} at the Glastonbury Festival. On 12 July, at the Oxegen Festival in Ireland she performed a well-received 50-minute set which was followed the next day by a 14-song set at T in the Park.|$|E

5|$|Irvine soon <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> his new neighbourhood; {{he enjoyed}} visiting Carrickfergus Castle and often spent {{time at the}} harbour. In 1950, he moved to Sunnylands Primary School and began to play {{football}} seriously. He initially concentrated on playing as a goalkeeper for the school team. In 1953, the team reached {{the final of the}} County Cup, but were defeated 0–3 by an older side from Carrick Technical School. Irvine's elder brother Bobby, who went on to represent Stoke City and was also a Northern Ireland international, played for the opposition. Along with his schoolmate William Donnelly, Irvine often frequented Windsor Park to watch the Northern Ireland national team, and he idolised players such as Jimmy McIlroy and Danny Blanchflower.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} due for release in June, {{but this was}} delayed until August to include {{material}} written after its completion which the band felt {{was too good to}} leave off. Upon its release, the UK music press immediately <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> the album, which also received Melody Maker 's Album of the Week accolade. The year ended with the band providing support for the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Wembley Arena and Manic Street Preachers at the Millennium Stadium. As of March 2003, the album has been certified gold shipping 100,000 units in the UK, with total counter sales standing at 110,000 as of February 2005. The album was Melody Makers #24 album of 1999, while Metal Hammer placed the album in at #6 and Kerrang! ranked it at #16.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{entered the}} White House as a bachelor, {{and his sister}} Rose Cleveland joined him, to act as hostess {{for the first two}} years of his administration. However, unlike the {{previous}} bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for very long. In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington. Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married. On June 2, 1886, Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room at the White House. He was the second President to wed while in office, and has been the only President married in the White House. This marriage was unusual, since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history, and the public soon <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> her beauty and warm personality.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E
25|$|Smuts' {{importance}} to the Imperial war effort was emphasised by a quite audacious plan, proposed as early as 1940, to appoint Smuts as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, should Churchill die or otherwise become incapacitated during the war. This idea was put by Sir John Colville, Churchill's private secretary, to Queen Mary and then to George VI, both of whom <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> the idea.|$|E

The event, coming {{on the heels of the}} German {{invasion}} of Hungary, was attended by thousands. Rabbi Mordechai spoke for a full 90 minutes. He was also heavily involved in helping war survivors obtain government benefits, housing and employment, and arranging weddings on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|Just {{two days}} after his victory in Vienna, Tsonga played his first-round match at the 2011 Valencia Open 500 as second seed. He lost in round two to Sam Querrey. As expected, the home crowd <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> Jo {{from the start of}} the 2011 BNP Paribas Masters. Tsonga had wins over Guillermo García-López, Andreas Seppi, and John Isner, which set up a final against Roger Federer. Federer stormed through the first set and then won a tiebreak in the second to take the title.|$|E

He gained their respect through his refusal to quit in the face of combat. Often riding in the lead vehicle, a lightly armored Humvee, Wright was in real danger for much of the time, and at one point carried a weapon, though he did so reluctantly.|$|E

25|$|Resazurin, C12H7NO4, {{obtained}} {{by the action of}} nitrous acid on resorcinol, forms small dark red crystals possessing a greenish metallic glance. When dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid and <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> 210°C, the solution on pouring into water yields a precipitate of resorufin, C12H7NO3, an oxyphenoxazone, which is insoluble in water, but is readily soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, and in solutions of caustic alkalis. The alkaline solutions are of a rose-red color and show a cinnabar-red fluorescence. A tetrabromresorufin is used as a dye-stuff under the name of Fluorescent Resorcin Blue.|$|E
25|$|Osmeña {{was born}} in Cebu City to Juana Osmeña y Suico, who was {{reportedly}} only 14 years of age at the time. Owing to {{the circumstances of his}} birth, the identity of his father had been a closely guarded family secret, allegedly a Go related to the now Gokongwei. Although carrying the stigma of being an illegitimate child – Juana never married his father – he did not allow this aspect to affect his standing in society. The Osmeña family, a rich and prominent clan of Chinese Filipino heritage with vast business interests in Cebu, <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> him as he established himself as a prominent figure in local society.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the region}} where {{radiative}} effects are important, the description given by the idealized greenhouse model becomes realistic. Earth's surface, <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> a temperature around 255K, radiates long-wavelength, infrared heat {{in the range of}} 4–100μm. At these wavelengths, greenhouse gases that were largely transparent to incoming solar radiation are more absorbent. Each layer of atmosphere with greenhouses gases absorbs some of the heat being radiated upwards from lower layers. It reradiates in all directions, both upwards and downwards; in equilibrium (by definition) the same amount as it has absorbed. This results in more warmth below. Increasing the concentration of the gases increases the amount of absorption and reradiation, and thereby further warms the layers and ultimately the surface below.|$|E

Micky, having <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> Arabella, and moved by Paige's story of her accident, not to mention fear of his getting hurt too when Rudi returns, offers to take Arabella home in Rudi's favourite car, thereby setting Paige free. Justin gives Paige some money to get on her way, but by now he wants an escape from his own life. He persuades Paige to take him with her. They leave together, and the play ends just as Rudi's gangsters are trying to force their way through the door to a surprised Derek and Dee.|$|E
25|$|The last proposal, {{made by the}} SARU, was {{reportedly}} driven by internal union politics. With only five guaranteed places in Super Rugby but six active franchises, the bottom team in the South African Conference faced a promotion/relegation playoff with the sixth franchise for {{a place in the}} next season's competition. Australia and New Zealand <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> the SARU proposal, as a trans-Tasman competition would potentially allow for more regional derbies, fewer time zone complications and less player travel. However, NZRU chief executive Steve Tew indicated that a competition that did not include South African teams was a commercial non-starter because of large broadcast revenues from that country and because the NZRU considered Super Rugby matches in South Africa to be critical for national team development.|$|E
25|$|In February 1915 Wilson had met Edith Bolling Galt, a {{southern}} widow and jeweler. After several meetings, {{he fell in}} love, and in May, Wilson proposed. He was rebuffed initially but Wilson was undeterred and the courtship continued. Edith initially did not pursue the furtherance of their physical interaction with the vigor of Wilson, but she gradually <b>warmed</b> <b>to</b> the relationship and they became secretly engaged {{in the fall of}} 1915. Many in Wilson's camp had become concerned about the appearance of a premature romance soon {{after the death of his}} wife; the engagement was made public in October and they were married on December 18, 1915. Wilson was the third president to marry while in office; after John Tyler in 1844 and Grover Cleveland in 1886.|$|E
