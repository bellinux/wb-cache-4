The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly.

5|$|The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2008, and was {{released}} worldwide on May 22, 2008 to generally positive reviews from critics, although audience reception was more mixed. There was significant praise for the performances, action scenes, John Williams' musical score, and the costume design. Criticism, however, focused on the dialogue, storyline, pacing, and overuse of CGI. It was also a financial success like the previous three films in the series, grossing over $786 million worldwide, becoming the franchise's highest-grossing film when not adjusted for inflation, and the second highest-grossing film of 2008. The film <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> by an untitled fifth film planned for release on July 10, 2020, in which both Spielberg and Ford will return.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced}} that the game was transitioning to become a free-to-play game under the title Evolve: Stage 2 due to the game downloadable content controversy and mixed critical reception. The new version introduces new changes, including longer respawn time, non-ranked queue for casual players, and changes to hunters' abilities. Turtle Rock also promised that patches would be released more frequently and that most items featured in the game would be unlocked through simply playing the game. The alpha version of Stage 2 would begin on July 7, 2016, for PC, and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> by a beta in August in the same year. Players who purchased the game will be given the Founders status, which gives them exclusive cosmetic items. In October 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced that}} they would end support for Evolve, and that Evolve: Stage 2 would not be released for consoles, but servers for the game will remain online for ‘foreseeable future’. Turtle Rock also revealed that it was 2K's decision to end the game's support.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the finite-dimensional representation theory of the Lorentz group mostly follows that of the subject in general. Lie theory originated with Sophus Lie in 1873. By 1888 the classification of simple Lie algebras was essentially completed by Wilhelm Killing. In 1913 the theorem of highest weight for representations of simple Lie algebras, the path that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> here, was completed by Élie Cartan. Richard Brauer was 1935–38 {{largely responsible for the}} {{development of}} the Weyl-Brauer matrices describing how spin representations of the Lorentz Lie algebra can be embedded in Clifford algebras. The Lorentz group has also historically received special attention in representation theory, see History of infinite-dimensional unitary representations below, due to its exceptional importance in physics. Mathematicians Hermann Weyl and Harish-Chandra and physicists Eugene Wigner and Valentine Bargmann made substantial contributions both to general representation theory and in particular to the Lorentz group. Physicist Paul Dirac was perhaps the first to manifestly knit everything together in a practical application of major lasting importance with the Dirac equation in 1928.|$|E
