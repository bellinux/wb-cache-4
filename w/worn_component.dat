40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} the finite element analysis of a die whose cavity was designed using reverse engineering techniques. A <b>worn</b> <b>component</b> was provided by RSP Tooling LLC. The geometry of the component was captured using reverse engineering techniques in the Cleveland State University component evaluation and prototyping laboratory using a MicroScribe digitizing arm in conjunction with the SolidWorks 3 -D CAD system, and the RevWorks reverse engineering add-on to SolidWorks. A die was designed in SolidWorks by sinking cavity into the block while applying appropriate shrink factors. A finite element stress analysis was performed on this die geometry, and it was found to be overstressed. Two different approaches were applied in this study to obtain appropriate die-increasing the wall thickness of the die and applying a shrink ring...|$|E

40|$|The {{recognition}} of wear condition in tribological {{system as well}} as wear mechanism in wear process mainly depends on the analysis of surface topographies of <b>wear</b> <b>components.</b> However, {{it is very difficult}} to access or analyze <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> which are in operation. It is well recognized that wear particles exhibit different surface morphology features in relation to the process of their generation. Therefore, it is possible to gain the surface information of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> which are difficult to access or analyze, through studying the surface characteristics of corresponding wear particles. This project aimed to predict surface features of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> based on surface characteristics of wear debris. The prediction framework has been proposed and presented in the paper. The analysis of feasibility has demonstrated that it is feasible to predict worn surface features according to the surface characteristics of wear particles...|$|R

40|$|Wear debris {{analysis}} {{is a technique}} for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. One key issue that affects the application of wear debris analysis for machine condition monitoring is whether the morphology of the wear particles accurately depicts their original states and the surface morphology of the components from which the particles separate. This study aimed to investigate {{the evolution of the}} surface morphology of wear debris in relation to change in the surface morphology of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> in sliding <b>wear</b> process. Sliding wear tests were conducted using a ball-on-disc tester under proper lubrication and improper lubrication conditions. The study of the particle size distribution and the surfaces of both the wear debris and the tested samples in relation to the wear condition and the wear rates of the <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> were carried out in this study. The evolutions of the surface topographies of both the wear debris and the <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> as <b>wear</b> progressed were investigated. This study has provided insight to the progress of material degradation through the study of wear debris. The results of this research have clearly demonstrated that: (a) there is a good correlation of the surface morphology of wear debris and that of the <b>wear</b> <b>components,</b> and (b) the surface morphology of wear debris contains valuable information for machine condition monitoring...|$|R

40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{research}} work has been conducted to evaluate and predict <b>wear</b> condition of <b>components</b> in machinery using wear debris analysis. However, there are few studies on quantitative surface characterization of wear particles {{although it has been}} recognized as an objective and effective means for assessing wear mechanisms and monitoring the condition of machinery. Moreover, for the surfaces of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> that are difficult to access or analyze, it is possible to evaluate the quantitative surface information of the <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> through studying the surface characterization of corresponding wear particles. Therefore, it is imperative that the study of the quantitative surface morphology of the wear debris is conducted. In this project, two most common motions occurring in machinery, that is, sliding and rolling, were simulated using a ball-on-disc tester. Wear particles were collected in running-in and steady-state wear stages and analysed using ferrography, a particle analyser, confocal laser scanning microscopy and computer image analysis techniques. Surface roughness parameters w;ere used to study the evolutions of the surface morphology of wear particles from running-in to steady state wear stages. Quantitative data on the evolutions of the surfaces of the wear debris were provided. The knowledge obtained in this research is important for predicting wear conditions using wear debris analysis techniques while further understanding of the wear mechanisms and wear characteristics has been also gained...|$|R
40|$|Running in is {{a complex}} process, and it {{significantly}} influences the performance and service life of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> as the initial phase of the entire wear process. Surface topography is an important feature of <b>wear</b> <b>components.</b> Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} investigate the running-in process with the help of surface topography for improvement. Because the surface roughness after running in is independent of the nature of initial roughness, it is difficult to predict the surface topography after running in based on unworn surface topography. Aiming to build a connection of surface topographies before and after the running-in process, a black-box model predicting surface topography after the running-in process was established based on least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and the areal surface evaluation parameters were adopted as model variables. To increase the adaptability of the predictive model, the main factors of the work condition were also taken into consideration. The prediction effect and sensitivity of the model were tested and analyzed. The analysis indicates that the hybrid property of surface topographies before and after running in is closely related. Moreover, the surface topography after running in is influenced more by the initial surface topography than by the work condition...|$|R

Maintenance activities include partial or complete overhauls at specified periods, oil changes, lubrication, minor adjustments, and so on. In addition, workers can record equipment deterioration so they know to replace or repair worn parts before they cause system failure. The ideal machine maintenance program would prevent any unnecessary and costly repairs.|$|R
