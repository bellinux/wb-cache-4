However, with the rapid urbanization and economic and societal change, homestead woodlands greatly vanish in Japan. The ecological multi functions of forests have been stressed in recent researches. The management and conservation of homestead woodland is little studied, although they have been closely relevant to habitants' wellbeing. The primary purpose of this study is to reveal dwellers' perception of homestead woodlands. The secondary purpose is to explore dwellers' willingness to conserve homestead woodlands by using the contingent valuation method (CVM). Survey was conducted in three hamlets with the best preserved Fukugi homestead woodlands in Okinawa Prefecture. Overwhelming majority of the respondents, accounting for around 91 %, preferred homestead woodlands to being conserved. Residents have highly valued the amelioration of micro-climate by homestead woodlands, such as windbreak and cooling the air in summer. In contrast, the contribution to biodiversity was slightly assessed, in particularly, in two small isolated islands. It was revealed that residents at small isolated have highly valued standing Fukugi trees concerning the function of preventing from typhoons. It was found that Fukugi homestead woodlands were considered as private goods by the dwellers as well as local authority. About half of the respondents perceived that the house owners and/or local authority such as hamlet community should be responsible for the conservation. The interesting finding in this study revealed that the residents' attitude toward homestead woodland was significant factor influencing their willingness to pay for <b>woods</b> <b>preservation.</b> Around 25 % of the total respondents rejected the payment. Estimated mean and median WTP values were JPY 1, 451 /household and JPY 1, 000 /household, respectively. Thus, environmental education and awareness arising will contribute to better conservation of their homestead woodlands. It is urgent to evaluate the non-use value of homestead woodlands as environmental goods and urge local policy makers to include Fukugi homestead woodlands in landscape planning and conservation. 本部町の備瀬・今帰仁村今泊・渡名喜島などに現存するフクギ屋敷林は、その推定樹齢から、その多くが１８世紀の３０年代以降に、王府によって計画的に造成されたものであることが、これまでの調査研究でわかってきた。フクギ林が選抜された最大の理由は、フクギのもつ多機能性（たとえば、潮害や台風からの防備、津波などからの防災、防火樹、建築材、染料など）に起因している。しかし、これらのフクギ林は、沖縄戦と終戦直後の木材不足による乱伐や開発によってそのほとんどが消滅した。現在では、一部の地域でその面影をみるのみである。フクギ屋敷林をどう保全し、今後、どのように活用すべきか、その方策に関する研究はほとんど見られない。本報告の目的は以下の２つである。第１は、フクギ屋敷林について、地域の住民がどのような意識をもっているか、アンケート調査から、この点を明らかにすることである。第２は、CVMの手法を用いて、フクギ屋敷林の多面的な価値の評価を行い、それによって住民や行政による保全対策の在り方を考察することである。CVMとは、一般の市民に対してアンケートを行い、仮想的な条件を想定し、環境保全や改善のために支払ってもよいと考える最大金額、すなわち支払意志額（Willingness to Pay; WTP) 等を質問し、環境価値を評価する手法である。沖縄県でフクギの屋敷林が最も多く残されている３つの地域（沖縄本島北部の備瀬、粟国島、渡名喜島）でアンケート調査を行った。アンケート調査の結果、圧倒的多数の人が（９１％）、フクギの屋敷林の存在意義を認めている。また、多くの住民の回答者や行政の回答から、フクギ屋敷林は住民の私的財産に属すると考えてもいることが分かった。回答者の約半数が、屋敷の所有者またはその村落共同体、地方自治体がフクギ屋敷林の保全に責任を負わなければならない、と答えている。屋敷林管理の放棄（たとえば空屋敷など）は、コミュニティ全体の集落景観や緑の空間によってもたらされる快適性の恩恵を大幅に低下させてしまうのではないかとの懸念もみられる。フクギ屋敷林を守っていくために「フクギ屋敷林保全基金」といったものを設立すると仮定し、回答者にフクギ屋敷林の保全基金にどの程度の支払い意志（WTP）があるのかを調査した。それによると支払い意志額（WTP）の１世帯当たりの平均値は， 1, 451 円となった。なお，中位値を計算すると 1, 000 円となった。支払い意志額の分析から，住民たちは全体としてフクギ屋敷林を評価していることが分かった。推計結果を見ると、「安定した収入源がある」と回答した者は，より大きなWTPを示していることが確認できた。また、「フクギ屋敷林を活用すべき」と回答した人のWTPも比較的高い数値を示した。以上のことから、フクギ屋敷林の保全に関しては、その評価に対する潜在的な意識は高く、新たな活用法を開発し、地域住民自ら保全活用する施策を見出して、それを行政側が支援して行く体制の構築が、今求められている...|$|R

30|$|Thermal {{treatment}} is a <b>wood</b> improvement and <b>preservation</b> process against biotic and abiotic factors [5]. Although the mechanical properties of wood {{are affected by}} the thermal treatment process [6], it provides some important improvements in wood properties including dimensional stability, hygroscopicity, and decay resistance [7 – 9]. Thermal treatments affect chemical factors required for the growth of fungi such as nitrogen, vitamins, minor metals and mineral elements [10]. With thermal treatment, wood becomes more resistant to fungi due to chemical modifications of the wood components of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [11 – 13]. On the other hand, thermal treatments reduce most of the mechanical strength properties of wood [14 – 17]. As a result of these undesired disadvantages, extensive commercial utilisation of thermally treated wood has been limited [18]. Through the modification of densification, many of the physical and mechanical properties of wood can be improved. The modification process of densification in wood is usually performed by compressing wood in a transverse direction. Additionally, wood material can be densified via the impregnation of various chemicals into the cell cavities of the wood.|$|R

The 19 year long process of spraying with polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been completed (April 29 (th) 2013) and the hull is air drying under tightly controlled conditions. Acidophilic bacteria capable of oxidising iron and sulfur have been previously identified and enriched from unpreserved timbers of the Mary Rose, demonstrating that biological pathways of iron and sulfur oxidization existed potentially in this <b>wood,</b> before <b>preservation</b> with PEG. This {{study was designed to}} establish if the recycled PEG spray system was a reservoir of microorganisms capable of iron and sulfur oxidization during preservation of the Mary Rose. Microbial enrichments derived from PEG impregnated biofilm collected from underneath the Mary Rose hull, were examined to better understand the processes of cycling of iron. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was utilised to demonstrate the biological contribution to production of sulfuric acid in the wood. Using molecular microbiological techniques to examine these enrichment cultures, PEG was found to mediate a shift in the microbial community from a co-culture of Stenotrophomonas and Brevunidimonas sp, to a co-culture of Stenotrophomonas and the iron oxidising Alicyclobacillus sp. Evidence is presented that PEG is not an inert substance in relation to the redox cycling of iron. This is the first demonstration that solutions of PEG used in the conservation of the Mary Rose are promoting the oxidation of ferrous iron in acidic solutions, in which spontaneous abiotic oxidation does not occur in water.

The purer elements could then be utilized in other applications. Later in his career he continued published and spoke about the numerical relations between the atomic masses of analogous elements. His theories were early in the development of the Periodic Table. He rejected the current theory of triads and expanded the connections between the elements to larger groupings. He argued that the weights of different elements in a group were separated by multiples of a certain number that varied based upon the group. His work in this area was later cited by Dmitri Mendeleev in his construction of the Periodic Table of Elements.

40|$|Waterlogged wood {{conservation}} is ultimately directed towards effective drying of artefacts, since through {{this procedure is}} {{the best hope for}} their stabilisation. This is a much more risky activity for the conservator than it is for the modern timber technologist, because of the extreme chemical and physical changes the material has undergone during its burial. Nevertheless, we already have a number of adequately successful methods for the conservation of archaeological wood. What we don't have is all the information we might want for the modification of these techniques to provide fully predictable results for the widely variable material which comes in for treatment or for the economical treatment of large structures and bulk assemblages. The conservator's primary concerns are with permeability, diffusion rates, drying behaviour,and internal surface calculation, all of which depend on the <b>wood's</b> chemical <b>preservation,</b> and are mirrored in its sorption characteristics. Wood-water relations of archaeological material have not as yet received much attention from researchers, and the chemistry of this material only slightly more. The findings of wood science can not be assumed to apply to archaeological material where radical chemical change has significantly changed its properties. This thesis addresses this problem by providing a comprehensive and critical synthesis of past and current research from the fields of waterlogged wood conservation, wood technology, chemistry, and microbiology, wood degradation, and wood-water relations. One of the outcomes of this work was the bringing to light of evidence for a much greater role for anaerobic decay vectors than has up to now been acknowledged. This only serves to emphasise the very real need for more research in the water relations and degradation chemistry of archaeological waterlogged wood, and perhaps even more for research into the development of assessment techniques specifically designed for this material, and easy and inexpensive to apply for the practising conservator. This thesis investigates the development of such techniques and compiles a critical review of a number of the techniques already in common use by conservators and wood scientists. The designs for a simple, accurate sorption measuring apparatus are given, and the results from a large group of archaeological wood samples reported. From these results it is determined that the controlling factor in the water relations of this material appears to be bulk mass losses rather than changes to chemical constituent ratios. Alternative diagnostic tools which have the potential of obtaining indircct information about wood-water relations indirectly are also critically appraised. The results from bulk chemical analyses are compared to those from physical tests of density, moisture content and strength measurements. Results from Sibert resistance drill trials and polarising microscopy are appraised. Certain findings from these contradict some of the assumptions which underpin our models for calculating internal void space in archaeological waterlogged wood which are used in defining our conservation treatment approaches. Three techniques of instrumental analysis are also examined. The results from FFIR, Py-GC/MS, and elemental analysis reveal a number of useful and casily-recognisable markers for degradation. A series of important new markers for syringyl lignin degradation arise from this study. In the final appraisal, preference lies with these latter diagnostic tools, and arguments are provided for their greater accessibility to the conservator...|$|R
