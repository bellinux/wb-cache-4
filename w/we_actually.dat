5|$|Second, Asch {{emphasized}} that independent thought and disagreement among group members is {{a cornerstone of}} group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> understand the shortcomings of our own beliefs (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale {{as the basis for}} his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} that then arises {{is whether the}} paradox is to be understood {{in the context of}} absolutely no background information (as Hempel suggests), or {{in the context of the}} background information that <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> possess regarding ravens and black objects, or with regard to all possible configurations of background information.|$|E
25|$|Note {{also that}} the {{population}} from which the sample is drawn {{may not be the}} same as the population about which <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> want information. Often there is large but not complete overlap between these two groups due to frame issues etc. (see below). Sometimes they may be entirely separate – for instance, we might study rats {{in order to get a}} better understanding of human health, or we might study records from people born in 2008 in order to make predictions about people born in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Finally, <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> don't need uDummy because it's {{there just}} to put all {{unmatched}} vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which {{is the end of}} our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E
25|$|In three {{dimensions}} this restates in matrix form an observation made by Euler, so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles Euler angles. However, {{the situation is}} somewhat more complicated than we have so far indicated. Despite the small dimension, <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use; {{and we also have}} some freedom in the choice of angles. Thus we find many different conventions employed when three-dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics, or medicine, or chemistry, or other disciplines. When we include the option of world axes or body axes, 24 different sequences are possible. And while some disciplines call any sequence Euler angles, others give different names (Cardano, Tait–Bryan, roll-pitch-yaw) to different sequences.|$|E
25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E

500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since." ...|$|E

CEO Tony Goodman said, [...] "We're giving RTS games on the console a shot. <b>We</b> <b>actually</b> spent a whole year just trying to reconstruct how the controls would work on an RTS game."

500|$|Writing in 1986, Danny Peary noted, [...] "It's hard {{to believe}} that in 1967 <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> waited in {{anticipation}} for this so-called James Bond spoof.

[...] Peary described the film as being [...] "disjointed and stylistically erratic" [...] and [...] "a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema," [...] before adding, [...] "It would have been a good idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. In fact, I recommend you see it on television when it's in a two-hour (including commercials) slot. Then you won't expect it to make any sense." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Observer, co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play Dr John Watson than they had for the title character. Producer Sue Vertue said, [...] "Benedict {{was the only person}} <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> saw for [...] Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John —and I think you get it as soon as they come into the room, you can see that they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too [...] "barmy", as the producers required someone [...] "straighter" [...] for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E
