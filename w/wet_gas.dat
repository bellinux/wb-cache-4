Also, in 1964 Imperial constructed another plant for solution gas/liquids extraction to service Judy Creek, Swan Hills, and other fields.|$|E

50|$|Superficial gas {{velocity}} is the {{gas velocity}} {{if there were}} no liquid present in the <b>wet</b> <b>gas</b> flow. In <b>wet</b> <b>gas</b> flows the gas velocity is higher due to a reduction in the pipe area caused by the presence of the liquid.|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{example of}} <b>wet</b> <b>gas</b> flows {{are in the}} {{production}} of natural gas in the oil and gas industry. Natural gas is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds with quantities of various non hydrocarbons. This exists in either a gaseous or liquid phase or in solution with crude oil in porous rock formations. The amount of hydrocarbons present in the liquid phase of the <b>wet</b> <b>gas</b> extracted depends on the reservoir temperature and pressure conditions, which change over time as the gas and liquid are removed. Changes in the liquid and gas content also occur when a <b>wet</b> <b>gas</b> is transported from a reservoir at high temperature and pressure to the surface where it experiences a lower temperature and pressure. The presence and changeability of this <b>wet</b> <b>gas</b> can cause problems and errors in the ability to accurately measure the gas phase flowrate.|$|E

30|$|The {{feed gas}} (F 1) was firstly {{introduced}} into the horizontal separation to remove impurities and water droplets (F 2) that had been carried along with the feed gas (F 1). The feed gas (F 1) entered {{the bottom of the}} absorber unit after the filtration and separation processes. The up-flowing feed gas eventually had countercurrent contact with the down-flowing 55  % (w) mixed-amines lean solution that entered {{from the top of the}} tower. Most of the H 2 S and CO 2 were absorbed by the lean solution here. The <b>wet</b> purified <b>gas</b> (F 2) left the tower and subsequently entered the vertical separator for removal of the remaining alcohol amine droplets (F 4) before leaving the installation.

30|$|Considering the {{atmosphere}} as a biphasic fluid {{composed of a}} mix of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>gases,</b> the ZTD may be split into two components: zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) and zenith wet delay (ZWD). The ZHD {{is due to the}} mix of dry gases in {{the atmosphere}} and can be modeled by means of consolidated relations involving the latitude and height of the GNSS station and atmospheric pressure measured in its proximity. The ZWD is due to water vapor refractivity caused by the dipole moment of water vapor molecules and is typically obtained from the difference between ZTD and ZHD (Bevis et al. 1992).|$|R

40|$|Binary Fe-Cr alloys {{were studied}} {{with respect to}} {{isothermal}} oxidation behavior at 900 degrees C in Ar-O- 2, Ar-H 2 O and Ar-H- 2 -H 2 O gas mixtures. Chromium in solution exhibits a higher tendency to become internally oxidized in the gases containing water vapor than in the Ar-O- 2 gas because of hydrogen dissolution in the alloy. This mechanism explains why Fe-Cr alloys with intermediate Cr contents (e. g., 10 - 20 wt. %) exhibit protective chromia-rich scale formation in dry gases but tend to form breakaway-type Fe-rich oxides in <b>wet</b> <b>gases.</b> (C) 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.
