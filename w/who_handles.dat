500|$|Bill Panzer {{said that}} Tessa became {{popular with the}} program's audience. Rob Lineberger called Tessa [...] "...beautiful and spirited," [...] and said that [...] "...she is the perfect mortal foil for MacLeod's heavy concerns. She lightens and {{strengthens}} him." [...] Reviewer Abbie Bernstein of the Audio Video Revolution website wrote that Tessa was [...] "...depicted not as a screechy, in-the-dark Lois Lane {{but rather as a}} woman <b>who</b> <b>handles</b> her lover’s supernatural aspects with remarkable pragmatism." [...] Berstein added that Tessa was [...] "estimable" [...] and [...] "...an unusually gutsy love interest (not to mention a refreshing sexually active heroine, as opposed to the coy 'sexual tension'-generating females who usually populate the genre)." [...] Other reviewers had a more negative opinion. Reviewer Gord Lacey of TVShowsOnDVD.com [...] "...found it odd that everyone liked Tessa because [...] found her rather annoying." [...] Reviewer Doug Anderson of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Tessa was [...] "...too arty and sympathetic to serve any purpose other than an emotional spur for the hero's vengeance." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{all were}} as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially {{strapped}} before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: [...] "The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as {{the writer and}} artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible." [...] Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: [...] "technically brilliant but... slightly compromised." [...] Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, <b>who</b> <b>handles</b> Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that [...] "most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work... some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who [...] "was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric" [...] and insisted that each strip [...] "had to include Annie disrobing". Beauchamp agreed: [...] "Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand." [...] Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that [...] "humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously." [...] However, they repeated their respect: [...] "The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution." ...|$|E
