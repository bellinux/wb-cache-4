5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly {{confessed to the}} crime, saying the murder {{was part of a}} larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E
5|$|I wish {{to state}} that my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts.</b>|$|E

25|$|This was {{the story}} about Mexican rebel, Pancho Villa, who takes to the hills after killing an {{overseer}} in revenge for his father's death. It was directed by Howard Hawks and starred Wallace Beery.

25|$|Since {{the church}} had been {{deprived}} of property in 1918, and the clergy had no fields to till as a result, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that the wealthier members of their congregation were being liquidated and the clergy were still forbidden to collect membership dues, they often {{no longer had a}} financial base to maintain their churches.|$|E

25|$|Quantum logic can be {{regarded}} as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann, who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} the {{witchcraft}} accusations, trials and executions has {{captured the imagination of}} writers and artists in the centuries since the event took place. Many interpretations have taken liberties <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the historical episode in the name of literary and/or artistic license. As the trials took place at the intersection between a gradually disappearing medieval past and an emerging enlightenment, and dealt with torture and confession, some interpretations draw attention to the boundaries between the medieval and the post-medieval as cultural constructions.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the best}} batting {{strategy}} for Team 1 {{ahead of a}} coming interruption {{is not always the}} same, but varies <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the opinions about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last – will Team 1's innings be re-started?).|$|E

According to his opinion, addiction is basically spiritual issue, so {{it needs to be}} treated on spiritual level.|$|R
25|$|Dumézil's {{studies were}} delayed by World War I, {{when he was}} drafted and served as an {{artillery}} officer. After the war, he resumed them and was particularly influenced by Antoine Meillet. He aggregated in 1919 in Classics and received his doctorate in 1924 after writing a thesis comparing the common origins of the Greek ambrosia and a similarly named Indian drink Amrita, which was said to make its imbiber immortal. The dissertation was controversial {{because some of the}} examiners, such as Henri Hubert, thought that Dumézil took liberty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> to generate a more beautiful interpretation (that was a common criticism of Dumézil's work).|$|E
25|$|When Søren Kierkegaard, as his {{character}} Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, {{he does not}} advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths {{for the study of}} subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that {{has little to do with}} one's actual experience of life.|$|E
25|$|Fletcher {{argued that}} the PC party did not run on {{creating}} a new Crown corporation. That the new crown corporation went far beyond what the government had stated and included items such as potable water. His main argument is that Manitoba has a massive supply of hydro generated power and continues to build more generation {{at the cost of}} billions of dollars, with no where to sell the power. Fletcher argues that the demand side management of power usage is not appropriate in the Manitoba context. This is because supply of power will exceed the demand for power until 2044. Combine <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that 97% of Manitoba power generation is clean, cheap, green energy, it does not help the environment or hydro fiscal position to reduce the demand of a product that Manitoba has far too much of. In addition, due to the over building undertaken by Manitoba Hydro under the previous government, Hydro {{has no choice but to}} raise rates. This in itself will reduce demand. The additional cost of creating a crown will increase rates further due to the huge expense.|$|E

25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This {{is the heart of}} what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E
