The results indicate prominent poleward eddy heat transport around the western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and equatorward eddy heat transport in the equatorial region, consistent with the previous studies using coarse-resolution OGCMs. Such poleward eddy heat transport in midlatitude oceans suggests that the eddies act to reduce meridional background temperature gradients across the currents, {{as would be expected}} based on baroclinic instability. Interestingly, however, along the southern flanks of the eastward jets of the Kuroshio Extension and the Gulf Stream, southward eddy heat transport occurs in subsurface layers. This is likely due to the southward migration of warm <b>water</b> <b>cores</b> originating from southern areas adjacent to these currents.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The “water-in-oil ” {{microemulsion}} polymerization of (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAM) {{enabled us}} to prepare a series of dilute “waterhodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (A 0 T) ln-hexane” microemulsions with PNIPAM as a stabilizer. A combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS) was used to study the temperature (2 ‘) and dispersed-phase concentration (C) dependence of this series of dilute microemulsions. For a given water/AOT molar ratio of w = 23, the average hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of the microemulsion increases with T when C is higher than 0. 150 g/mL but decreases when C is- 100 -fold dilute. In comparison with the HzOIAOTln-hexane microemulsion wherein no PNIPAM is introduced as a stabilizer, the H~O(PNIPAM) /AOT/n-hexane microemulsion is much more stable {{in the range of}} 1. 50 x g/mL.
