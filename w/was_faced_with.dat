5|$|Because of its {{multitude}} of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria prior to independence <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> sectarian tensions and violence, {{particularly in the}} oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. Some of the ethnic groups like the Ogoni, have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{arrived in}} Canada {{with the rest}} of the 49th foot and was {{initially}} assigned to Montreal. Almost immediately, in 1804 he <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> one of the primary problems in Canada: desertion. Seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across the river (and border) into the United States. Despite having no jurisdiction on American soil, Brock sent a party across the border in pursuit and the men were captured.|$|E

5|$|In 1040, Duncan I {{launched}} an attack into Moray and {{was killed in}} action by Macbeth's troops. Macbeth succeeded him as King of Alba, apparently with little opposition. His 17-year reign was mostly peaceful, although in 1054 he <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> an English invasion, led by Siward, Earl of Northumbria, on behalf of Edward the Confessor. Macbeth was killed at the Battle of Lumphanan in 1057 by forces loyal to the future Malcolm III. He was buried on Iona, the traditional resting place of Scottish kings.|$|E
5|$|In 1665, Charles <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a great health crisis: the Great Plague of London. The {{death toll}} reached {{a peak of}} 7,000 per week in the week of 17 September.

Casey had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a primary. A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey,Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Buenos Aires, Eva Duarte <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the {{difficulties}} of surviving without formal education or connections.

5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population. In view of the German populace's tepid response to the orchestrated violence of Kristallnacht, the Nazis perceived an urgent need for films that would move German popular sentiment {{in favor of the}} Nazi Final Solution to the 'Jewish question'. Frustrated with the delays on the Jud Süß project, Goebbels ordered Fritz Hippler, the head of his film department, to sack Brauer and bring in Veit Harlan to take over as director.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Empire <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> new enemies. Provinces in {{southern}} Italy faced the Normans, {{who arrived in}} Italy {{at the beginning of}} the 11th century. During a period of strife between Constantinople and Rome culminating in the East-West Schism of 1054, the Normans began to advance, slowly but steadily, into Byzantine Italy. Reggio, the capital of the tagma of Calabria, was captured in 1060 by Robert Guiscard, followed by Otranto in 1068. Bari, the main Byzantine stronghold in Apulia, was besieged in August 1068 and fell in April 1071. The Byzantines also lost their influence over the Dalmatian coastal cities to Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia (r. 1058–1074/1075) in 1069.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the island's {{population}} {{consisted of}} about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island {{who had not yet}} accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. However, less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.|$|E

However, Chris developed a crush on Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) and subsequently revealed that he was gay. Chris initially struggled with his sexuality and the reactions of his friends, family and team mates. Upon finding employment at the local garage, Chris <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a homophobic customer. In August 2011, a love interest for Chris was introduced in the form of Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) and they formed Neighbours first gay couple. After a break-up and reunion, Chris and Aidan split for good in January 2013. Chris became the focus of a coward punch storyline in 2014 and agreed to have a baby with his friend Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell).|$|E

5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E
5|$|Following the hasty {{departure}} of PedroI, Brazil {{was left with}} a five-year-old boy as head of state. With no precedent to follow, the Empire <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> {{the prospect of a}} period of more than twelve years without a strong executive, as, under the constitution, PedroII would not attain his majority and begin exercising authority as Emperor until 2 December 1843. A regency was elected to rule the country in the interim. Because the Regency held few of the powers exercised by an emperor and was completely subordinated to the General Assembly, it could not fill the vacuum at the apex of Brazil's government.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 Manuel <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman {{attack in the}} Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E

5|$|In 1833, his son Minh Mạng <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a {{rebellion}} led by Lê Văn Khôi, which started after {{the tomb of}} Khôi's father Lê Văn Duyệt was desecrated by imperial officials. The rebels {{took control of the}} citadel and the revolt continued until the imperial forces took control of the citadel in 1835. Following the capture of the citadel, Minh Mang ordered its razing and replacement with a smaller square stone-built structure, that was more vulnerable to attacks. On February 17, 1859, the citadel was captured during the French invasion after less than a day of battle and significant amounts of military supplies were seized. Realising {{that they did not have}} the capacity to hold the fort against Vietnamese attempts to recapture it, the French razed it with explosives, before withdrawing their troops.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{producer}} Ilya Salkind {{convinced his}} father Alexander {{to buy the}} rights to Superman. They hired Mario Puzo to pen a two-film script, and negotiated with Steven Spielberg to direct, though Alexander Salkind rejected him as Jaws went over budget. Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman signed on to play Jor-El and Lex Luthor respectively, and Guy Hamilton was hired to direct. However, Brando <b>was</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> an obscenity lawsuit in Italy over Last Tango in Paris, and Hamilton was unable to shoot in England as he had violated his tax payments. The Salkinds hired Richard Donner to direct the film. Donner hired Tom Mankiewicz to polish the script, giving it a serious feel with Christ-like overtones.|$|E
