40|$|Objective To {{frame the}} {{discussion}} of the nation's health within the context of maternal and child health. Methods We used national data or estimates to assess the burden of 46 determinants. Results During 2002 - 2004, U. <b>S.</b> <b>women</b> of reproductive age experienced significant challenges from macrosocial determinants, to health care access, and to their individual health preservation. Two-thirds of women do not consume recommended levels of fruits and vegetables. Overall, 29 % experienced income poverty, 16. 3 % were uninsured. About one in four women of reproductive age lived with poor social capital. Compared with white women of reproductive age, non-white women reported higher levels of dissatisfaction with the health care system and race-related discrimination. Among all U. <b>S.</b> <b>women,</b> chronic <b>diseases</b> contributed to the top nine leading causes of disability adjusted life years. About one-third of women had no prophylactic dental visits in the past year, or consumed alcohol at harmful levels and smoked tobacco. One in three women who had a child born recently did not breast feed their babies. Demographics of women who are at increased risk for the above indicators predominate among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Conclusions At least three-fourths of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>women</b> of reproductive age were at risk for poor health of their own and their offspring. Social intermediation and health policy changes are needed to increase the benefits of available health and social sector interventions to women and thereby to their offspring.

40|$|Purpose of review: To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between androgens, cognition and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Recent findings: It {{has been found that}} low circulating levels of androgens are a risk factor for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased circulating androgens are also associated with declining cognitive performance, particularly in memory-related tasks. Conversely, androgen supplementation to hypogonadal men results in improved memory performance. It has therefore been hypothesized that androgen supplementation may be beneficial in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In recent studies, animal models have been used to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind this relationship between androgens and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> These studies have shown that androgen depletion results in increased levels of beta amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, changes which are thought to be associated with subsequent neuronal death.

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state.

In contrast, participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the off stimulation condition showed a pattern of aberrant controlled lexical-semantic processing as evidenced by a lack of semantic priming effects at the long SOA condition. Controlled semantic priming was present, however, when the participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> were receiving stimulation of the STN, suggesting that STN stimulation modulates basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits involved in such processes. Finally, delayed reaction times for negatively valenced targets compared with neutrally valenced targets was evident in participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the on stimulation condition and control participants, but not for participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the off stimulation condition, suggesting that the incidental evaluation of negatively versus neutrally valenced words in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is modulated by basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is {{characterized}} by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Although much is known about the molecular events leading to the formation of plaques and tangles as well as their relevance in neuronal cell loss associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> the link between these two pathologies is presently unknown. The exact mechanism of neuronal cell death in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has been a debated issue with both the necrosis and apoptosis pathways having been implicated. The activation of apoptosis in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has recently gained momentum, namely because of the development of specific markers for caspase activation. These markers consist of antibodies, termed caspase-cleavage site-directed antibodies that are designed to detect either the active enzymatic fragments of caspases following their activation or protein products targeted for caspase cleavage. The use of these markers has demonstrated the widespread activation of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain. In addition, many of these markers have been co-localized with markers for neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting that caspases {{may play a role in}} the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and, thus, do not simply represent end-stage events associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In this review, recent studies documenting the role of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain will be discussed, along with the methodology behind the synthesis of site-directed caspase-cleavage antibodies. A model will be presented whereby caspases serve not simply as end-game players, but may actually serve as a link between senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this context, a discussion of the therapeutic value of targeting caspase inhibition in the treatment of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> will be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objectives}} {{in this study}} were to elucidate various aspects of the epidemiology of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. This organism was isolated from the midstream urine specimens of 7. 5 % of 145 college women with frequency and urgency of urination and dysuria, but from only 0. 07 % of 14, 835 urine specimens from adult inpatients at the Victoria General Hospital. It was found {{to be part of the}} urethral flora of only 2 % of healthy women. Other staphylococci which formed part of the urethral flora of 100 healthy <b>women</b> included <b>S.</b> epidermidis (59 <b>women),</b> <b>S.</b> hominis (15 <b>women),</b> <b>S.</b> haemolyticus (13 <b>women),</b> <b>S.</b> warneri (9 <b>women),</b> and <b>S.</b> aureus (6 <b>women).</b> Finally, we determined that resistance to the 5 -micrograms novobiocin disk has a 93 % positive predictive accuracy as a presumptive test for S. saprophyticus...|$|R
