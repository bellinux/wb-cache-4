25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?" ...|$|E

500|$|Despite having {{finished}} the script in 1985, Joel explained, [...] "We couldn't make Hudsucker back then because we weren't that popular yet. Plus, the script {{was too expensive}} and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> completed Blood Simple, which was an independent film." [...] After completing Barton Fink (1991), the Coens were looking forward to doing a more mainstream film. The Hudsucker Proxy was revived and the Coens and Raimi performed a brief rewrite. Producer Joel Silver, {{a fan of the}} Coens' previous films, acquired the script for his production company, Silver Pictures, and pitched the project at Warner Bros. Pictures. Silver also allowed the Coens complete artistic control.|$|E

So we wanted to write [...] "Behind" [...] with her from the beginning, but we were in different places. She had just won [...] "American Idol" [...] and was on tour, so she'd e-mail me lyrics, and I'd e-mail her my thoughts.|$|E

In a letter read during the ceremony, Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, wrote: [...] "I remember Montreal and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great city. Before Jack and I moved to Montreal, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida.

Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives.

500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20January, a {{force of}} over 100Japanese aircraft, {{comprising}} bombers, dive bombers and fighter escort, converged on Rabaul. It was led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had controlled the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941. Two patrolling Wirraways of No.24 Squadron attacked {{the first wave of}} Japanese raiders. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then scrambled, one crashing on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the sea by Mitsubishi Zero fighters, two others crash landed with severe damage, one escaped with minor damage, and one remained unscathed. The ten-minute action killed six RAAF aircrew and wounded five. An Australian soldier on the ground later recalled, [...] "We sat at our guns, shocked by the massacre <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> observed". The Japanese fighters compounded the humiliation by executing aerobatics over the bombed airfield. Lerew signalled headquarters, [...] "Two Wirraways useless defence. Will you now please send some fighters?", receiving the reply, [...] "Regret inability to supply fighters. If we had them you would get them." [...] The next day he was ordered to attack the approaching Japanese fleet with [...] "all available aircraft". As his two serviceable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left only the one remaining Hudson with which to execute the order; it duly took off to search for the enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall, and returned to base.|$|E

500|$|... "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E
500|$|Digital Dimension {{took charge}} of the visual effects of the film. CG {{supervisor}} Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. [...] "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," [...] Crosby indicated. [...] "It began with R on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." [...] Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also inputed for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.|$|E

2500|$|During {{her time}} in Brazil Bishop became {{increasingly}} interested in the languages and literatures of Latin America. She was influenced by South and Central American poets, including the Mexican poet Octavio Paz and the Brazilian poets João Cabral de Melo Neto and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and translated their work into English. Regarding de Andrade, she said, [...] "I didn't know him at all. He's supposed to be very shy. I'm supposed to be very shy. We've met once — on the sidewalk at night. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> {{come out of the}} same restaurant, and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced."

I was doing a Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the answer.

2500|$|The band {{initially}} {{planned to}} release Wah Wah simultaneously with Laid, or perhaps to release them {{together as a}} double album or to release Wah Wah as a free giveaway with Laid, but these plans were shelved when the band's record label, Fontana Records, were initially reluctant to release Wah Wah. Glennie recalled [...] "we bumped into problems with the record company’s {{ability to deal with}} [...] I think they thought it would confuse people, which is a shame, really. I wish now in reflection <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> kind of pushed them regardless and done it." [...] Laid itself was released alone by the label on 5 October 1993. It was the band's biggest success to date, receiving some of the band's best reviews, and it was also their first album to chart in the United States and ultimately their most successful there, peaking at number 72 on the Billboard 200 chart and later being certified Gold by the RIAA for selling 600,000 copies there. It success was largely due to the lead single, [...] "Laid", which became a crossover hit in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Yeo {{closed out}} {{the year by}} winning two medals at her third Southeast Asian Games in Naypyidaw, Burma. In the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, Yeo with Tao Li, Amanda Lim and Quah Ting Wen won gold in 4:13.02, {{extending}} Singapore's winning streak in the event to six.

Yeo was delighted with her results, considering the injury sustained to her leg only eight weeks prior. She said [...] "I was devastated because when I got injured, {{we were on the}} verge of giving up these SEA Games for the good of my long-term competitive future. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> two weeks of training and it took a toll on me not just physically but also mentally, because there was also the fear of a recurrence of the injury."
