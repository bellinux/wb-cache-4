40|$|Computer {{programs}} were developed which calculate the in-duct acoustic modes excited by a fan/stator stae operating at subsonic tip speed. Three noise source mechanisms are included: (1) sound {{generated by the}} rotor blades interacting with turbulence ingested into, or generated within, the inlet duct; (2) sound generated by the stator vanes interacting with <b>the</b> turbulent <b>wakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotors blades; and (3) sound generated by the stator vanes interacting with the mean velocity deficit <b>wakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotor blades. The fan/stator stage is modeled as an ensemble of blades and vanes of zero camber and thickness enclosed within an infinite hard-walled annular duct. Turbulence drawn into or generated within the inlet duct is modeled as nonhomogeneous and anisotropic random fluid motion, superimposed upon a uniform axial mean flow, and convected with that flow. Equations for the duct mode amplitudes, or expected values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplitudes, are derived...|$|R

Incident management teams were also established to help people in the <b>wake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the <b>wake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm.
