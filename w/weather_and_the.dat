Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fact that the stadium was half-empty {{through much of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|The 21st, about 960 strong, {{boarded the}} steamer Northerner on January 6, 1862. The fleet {{transporting}} Burnside's North Carolina Expedition encountered harsh weather {{off the coast}} of Cape Hatteras. Prolonged poor <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shallowness of Hatteras Inlet resulted in weeks of delay as the fleet struggled to enter Pamlico Sound. Finally, just as most of the vessels began to run low on potable water, the fleet entered the sound and made for Roanoke Island on February 5, 1862.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders' {{defensive}} positions {{had been}} improved despite the <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> harassment from German artillery, which killed Fulton, the original {{commander of the}} Rifle Brigade, when a barrage targeted his headquarters.

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad <b>weather,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|After a few days, {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe <b>weather,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked forces of the 278. Infanterie-Division holding two hills just across the Sammarinese border; after heavy fighting to gain control of the hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino itself. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September, and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st, leaving it {{under the control of the}} local defence forces.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on August 4, 1941, {{they drew}} up {{the plan in}} {{accordance}} with strategic policies promulgated earlier that year, outlined in the ABC-1 agreement with the British Commonwealth, and Rainbow 5, the U.S. war plan. The group completed AWPD-1 in the allotted nine days and carefully rehearsed a presentation to the Army General Staff. Its forecast figures, despite planning errors from lack of accurate information about <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> German economic commitment to the war, were within 2 percent of the units and 5.5 percent of the personnel ultimately mobilized, and it accurately predicted the time frame when the invasion of Europe by the Allies would take place.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the heavy}} North Korean losses {{during the initial}} UN attacks, Almond again ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to {{recapture}} Wonju on January 9. About four infantry battalions from the US 23rd and 38th Infantry Regiment supported by French and Dutch troops advanced toward Wonju on January 9, yet the attack was stalled at Hill 247 due to the cold <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of air support. As the UN forces tried to dislodge the North Koreans the next day, they were met by six defending North Korean battalions with an estimated strength of 7,000 soldiers. Under a heavy snowstorm and with no air support, the battle for Hill 247 continued for most of January 10, and the fighting around the French Battalion of the 23rd Infantry Regiment became particularly fierce. At one point, the French Battalion was forced to fend off several North Korean counterattacks with bayonet charges after running out of ammunition. The French Battalion's action at Wonju impressed Ridgway, who later encouraged all American units in Korea to utilize bayonets in battle. The North Koreans tried to encircle the attacking UN forces as the latter began to gain the upper hand, however artillery fire broke up the North Korean formations, and they had suffered an estimated 2,000 casualties {{in the aftermath of}} the battle. When air support returned on January 11, the attacking UN forces inflicted another 1,100 North Korean casualties and captured Hill 247 by January 12. Although the cold <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stubborn North Korean defenses prevented the UN forces from entering Wonju, the capture of Hill 247 had put all of Wonju within UN artillery range, and the village soon became a no man's land under the devastating bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In 1779, Seymour was {{promoted}} once more, making post captain in HMS Porcupine and serving {{in command of}} HMS Diana, HMS Ambuscade and HMS Latona, all in the Channel Fleet. The only major operation in which he participated during the period was {{the conclusion of the}} Great Siege of Gibraltar, when Latona was attached to Lord Howe's fleet that relieved the fortress. During this service, Seymour was repeatedly engaged in scouting the Franco-Spanish fleet in Algeciras, a task made difficult by bad <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> erratic movements of the enemy. During much of the operation, Captain Roger Curtis was stationed aboard Latona to facilitate communicate between Howe and the Governor of Gibraltar. The effort to relieve and resupply the fortress was a complete success and Latona was sent back to Britain with dispatches, although Seymour remained in Gibraltar.|$|E

Some species of triggerplants are suitable for cultivation outdoors outside of the Australian continent including most of the United Kingdom and as far north as New York City or Seattle in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December, Tom Bawcock {{decided to}} brave the storms {{and went out}} in his fishing boat.

The entire catch (including seven types of fish) was baked into a pie, which had the fish heads poking through to prove that there were fish inside. Ever since then, the Tom Bawcock's Eve festival is held on 23 December in Mousehole. The celebration and memorial {{to the efforts of}} Tom Bawcock sees the villagers parading a huge stargazy pie during the evening with a procession of handmade lanterns, before eating the pie itself.|$|E

Boyington was shot down and parachuted into the St. George's Channel. The next day, Bolt led a flight of four Corsairs from VMF-214 in search of Boyington. Despite hazy <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need to take an indirect route to avoid Japanese radar, Bolt managed to lead the flight to {{the area where the}} battle had taken place the day before. Although they did not spot Boyington, they discovered and engaged a flotilla of Japanese barges, destroying six of them.

5|$|That second column, {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's VCorps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore {{had to take}} a longer, more practicable route into Extremadura. Bad <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.|$|E

Organised football has been played in the country since the 19th century; Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag was its first club, founded in 1892.
