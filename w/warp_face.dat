We {{address the problem of}} correcting an undesirable expression on a face photo by transferring local facial components, such as a smiling mouth, from another face photo of the same person which has the desired expression. Direct copying and blending using existing compositing tools results in semantically unnatural composites, since expression is a global effect and the local component in one expression is often incompatible with the shape and other components of the face in another expression. To solve this problem we present Expression Flow, a 2 D flow field which can <b>warp</b> the target <b>face</b> globally in a natural way, so that the <b>warped</b> <b>face</b> is compatible with the new facial component to be copied over. To do this, starting with the two input face photos, we jointly construct a pair of 3 D face shapes with the same identity but different expressions. The expression flow is computed by projecting {{the difference between the two}} 3 D shapes back to 2 D.

40|$|Practical face {{recognition}} {{has been studied}} in the past decades, but still remains an open challenge. Current prevailing approaches have already achieved substantial breakthroughs in recognition accuracy. However, their performance usually drops dramatically if face samples are severely misaligned. To address this problem, we propose a highly efficient misalignment-robust locality-constrained representation (MRLR) algorithm for practical real-time {{face recognition}}. Specifically, the locality constraint that activates the most correlated atoms and suppresses the uncorrelated ones, is applied to construct the dictionary for face alignment. Then we simultaneously align the <b>warped</b> <b>face</b> and update the locality-constrained dictionary, eventually obtaining the final alignment. Moreover, we {{make use of the}} block structure to accelerate the derived analytical solution.

We suggest a preprocessing step to <b>warp</b> <b>faces</b> from a non frontal pose to a near frontal pose. We use view-based active appearance models to fit to a novel face image under a random pose. The model parameters are adjusted to correct for the pose and used to reconstruct the face under a novel pose. This preprocessing makes face recognition more robust with respect to variations in the pose. An improvement in the identification rate of 60 % (from 15 % to 75 %) is obtained for faces under a pose of 45 degree...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sadum {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} cloths of the Batak people in North Sumatra. It is woven on a back strap loom with supplementary weft technique. Sadum is a <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> weaving made of cotton and beads woven into the cloth. Ritually it is used as a shoulder cloth, gifts exchanges, and in dances. It also bears the symbol of good tidings and blessings for the receiver. The cloth has change during times in technique, color, patterns, as well as in functions. But the use as a ritual cloth stays the same. The basic weaving techniques and equipments used to create it hasn’t change, but its material and added techniques has made this cloth become more rich in color, pattern, and texture. Most changes began when the Europeans came to Indonesia and introduced new material such as synthetic fibers and colors. In the 70 s traditional cloth of Indonesia got its boost when the government declared batik as Indonesian national attire. This encourages other traditional weavings to develop into contemporary clothing. Later, new techniques and material were introduced to the Sadum weavings including embroidery, silk and golden threads which were never used before...|$|R

They are woven as <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> and the pattern design is made changing colors through discontinuous warps and mixing with weft faced weaving {{at the bottom of}} the tunics. One of them has coarse embroidered selvedges, which probably were created as reinforcement for the sides and as decorative features for the textile. The tunics originally formed part of mummy bundles that were excavated in small mounds or funerary túmulos between several layers of organic matter and earth. Most of the other textiles that also formed part of the bundles are made combining several techniques like slit-tapestry and different kinds of embroidery. Other objects, such as a wooden whistle and feathers are located in the same area, so this area is considered to be a burial ground for distinctive persons.

50|$|A simple loom {{which has}} its roots in ancient civilizations {{consists}} of two sticks or bars between which the warps are stretched. One bar is attached to a fixed object, and the other to the weaver usually by means of a strap around the back. On traditional looms, the two main sheds are operated by means of a shed roll over which one set of warps pass, and continuous string heddles which encase each of the warps in the other set. The weaver leans back and uses his or her body weight to tension the loom. To open the shed controlled by the string heddles, the weaver relaxes tension on the warps and raises the heddles. The other shed is usually opened by simply drawing the shed roll toward the weaver. Both simple and complex textiles can be woven on this loom. Width is limited to how far the weaver can reach from side to side to pass the shuttle. <b>Warp</b> <b>faced</b> textiles, often decorated with intricate pick-up patterns woven in complementary and supplementary warp techniques are woven by indigenous peoples today around the world. They produce such things as belts, ponchos, bags, hatbands and carrying cloths. Supplementary weft patterning and brocading is practiced in many regions. Balanced weaves are also possible on the backstrap loom. Today, commercially produced backstrap loom kits often include a rigid heddle.|$|R
40|$|The area of {{this work}} is distressed denim in women’s wear. Denim wear has been distressed by {{machines}} to imitate the individual patina that becomes from wearing e. g. a pair of unwashed jeans until the color strips from creases. This work uses challenges the faked used look, using a decorative motive in distressed denim. Lace {{has been used as}} a decoration of dress since medieval times. By using lace as the pattern for the distressing of denim one will decorate the denim in a destructive way that questions the perfection and delicate way that lace is usually used. Lace consists of threads and holes that builds an ornamental pattern, worn down denim often results in holes and threads at the most vulnerable areas of the garment. Denim is a <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> cotton twill weave with blue indigo yarn in warp and natural white yarn in weft. By using a laser cutter to engrave a pattern on the <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> side of the denim, one can set the settings on the laser cutter so that only the blue warp threads will be met by the laser beam. After wash the engraved warp threads will dissolve and depending on the scale and the design of the pattern the unengraved parts can dissolve as well. Therefor one needs to fix the unengraved parts of the pattern before wash if one wants the pattern to remain. There is several ways to fix the pattern before wash; this work includes fixing with laser cut fusing and with seams. Some of the garments aren’t engraved in this work but cut in the laser cutter. The two cutting techniques used is first a regular cut out technique and second a slicing technique. The shapes of the garments derives from typical denim and lace garments such as jeans, denim jackets, denim shirts, lace gown, wedding dresses and underwear such as negligees, corsets, bras and panties. Initially, experiments were done to understand the visual and technical effect of clashing materials and garments. The result is a collection, combining ideas from two different origins in fashion, denim from mineworkers and lace from nobles. The outfits manages how one can control distressed denim and shows a variation from lace, to garments where the traces of lace have completely or partially dissolved. The primary motive is to investigate surface possibilities in distressed denim through a specific pattern. The result is difficult to control and experiments in full scale are necessary to evaluate distressed experiments. The secondary motive is global. Can lasercutting and engravings be an alternative to sandblasting ? It is not dealt with in this investigation. However this investigation shows a selection of alternative expressions for distressed denim. This work challenges the idea of distressed denim as the only way to make a fake, torned effect. It points at new possibilities, using decorative motifs by lasercuts and engravings in combination with other treatments in search for alternative expressions in denimwear...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} and compare 3 D face {{registration}} and recognition algorithms {{which are based}} solely on 3 D shape information and analyze methods based on the fusion of shape features. We have analyzed two different registration algorithms which produce a dense correspondence between faces. The first algorithm non-linearly <b>warps</b> <b>faces</b> to obtain registration, while the second algorithm allows only rigid transformations. Registration is handled {{with the use of}} an average face model which significantly fastens the registration process. As 3 D facial features, we compare the use of 3 D point coordinates, surface normals, curvature-based descriptors, 2 D depth images, and facial profile curves. Except for surface normals, these feature descriptors are frequently used in state-of-the-art 3 D face recognizers. We also perform an in-depth analysis of decision-level fusion techniques such as fixedrules, voting schemes, rank-based combination rules, and novel serial fusion architectures. The results of the recognition and authentication experiments conducted on the 3 D_RMA database indicate that: (i) in terms of face registration method, registration of <b>faces</b> without <b>warping</b> preserves more discriminatory information, (ii) in terms of 3 D facial features, surface normals attain the best recognition performance, and (iii) fusion schemes such as product rules, improved consensus voting and proposed serial fusion schemes improve the classification accuracy. Experimental results on the 3 D_RMA confirm these findings by obtaining % 0. 1 misclassification rate in recognition experiments, and % 8. 06 equal error rate in authentication experiments using surface normal-based features.

5000|$|Like other {{indigenous}} garments, the quechquemitl is {{made from}} uncut pieces of cloths as they come off the loom. Quechquemitl designs are achieved through weaving (fiber, color, structure), surface ornamentation (usually embroidery) and finishes applied to the seams and edges. [...] Various kinds of weaves are done for quechquemitls includes gauze, seersucker, brocade and curved or shaped weaving. The finest gauze pieces are from the Sierra Norte de Puebla, with very complex arrangements of heddles, often with six used {{and as many as}} twenty have been noted. These gauze weavings tend to be more complex than those used for huipils. Some appear as a checkerboard pattern. Seersucker is used by adding commercial threads in stripes along with the handspun threads. The commercial threads do not shrink when washed and the puckering effect is created. Weft brocade is a decorative technique where heavier threads are introduced in the weft to create patterns. A looped brocade is also created by tugging on these weft threads to raise them. These brocades are often mistaken as embroidery in both Mexican and Guatemalan textiles. The curved weaving technique is particularly complicated and unique. Part of the warp is of white cotton and part a colored wool, either red or pink. The wool warp is much longer than the cotton at a point in the weaving producing <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> fabric. The wool warp is cult and used as weft in a weft faced band, given the look of a colored border. The curvature is designed to fall on the shoulders of the wearer.

30|$|Denim as a fabric, has {{received}} the widest acceptance among all textile products. It has had an incredible influence on consumers both socially and culturally (Paul 2015). This twill cotton fabric usually has warp threads indigo dyed while weft remains plain white. The <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> fabric therefore looks blue {{on one side and}} white on reverse. The warp being ring dyed, creates denim’s fading characteristics, which is unique compared to every other textile material. With changing times, many new variants of denim came into existence. Denim washing {{is one of the key}} areas in getting the faded look. Earlier stone washing used to be done to achieve soft feel and the desired appearance. During washing, the pumice stone, scraps off the dye particles from the yarn surface in the denim fabric. Due to the ring dyeing of denim fabric and heavy abrasion during stone washing process, the faded effect is achieved. Oxidative bleaching agent with or without the addition of stones have also been used to get fading effect. Difficulty in removing residual pumice from fabric, damage to equipment and clogging of machine drainage passage due to particulate material proved to be major drawbacks with the technique (Heikinheimo et al. 2000). Later on use of enzymes became a sustainable option to get the worn out look in denim. The enzymes used are cellulase enzymes, specifically acting on the cellulose part, mainly on the surface of the fabric. This gives the desired look and at the same time, removes hairiness from surface thus giving a smooth and soft feel. Enzymes are substrate specific in their action, unaffecting the others. They are primarily used in textiles to promote hydrolysis of the required substrate (Patra 2003).|$|R

30|$|The {{backrest}} or whip roller {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts of a weaving machine, and lengthwise yarn of the fabric known as warp yarn passes over the backrest. One of the main functions of the backrest oscillation is to compensate variation in warp tension as they are unwound from the weaver’s beam during each weaving cycle of the loom. This tension can not be kept constant during the process and also during each weaving cycle of the loom. But due to have a very negligible difference among the tensions of each loom cycle, an average value of tension is maintained throughout the weaving process in factory. If this tension is kept at a constant then the fabrics will be woven with minimum number of warp breakages yielding a better loom efficiency and higher quality. The correct selection of the backrest of a loom is vital in producing high quality woven fabric. Adjustments to the positioning of the backrest, its type are inevitable when the performance of the weaving machine can no longer be tolerated with standard settings for low weft density, high weft density, and extra heavy fabrics. Vary in fabric density is a crucial especially in technical textiles and smart textiles (Fernando 2014). Denim fabrics have developed into a part of the garment fashion since the ninetieth century. Most consumers around the world prefer cotton apparel; in particular, they enjoy wearing denim. The success of denim is due to its ability to change with every social and cultural evolution (Card et al. 2006). According to Textile terms and definition published by Textile Institute Denim is traditionally a 3 / 1 <b>warp</b> <b>faced</b> twill fabric made from yarn dyed warp and undyed weft yarn. As denim is one type of woven fabric so it is obvious that like other woven fabrics, properties of denim is also affected by position of whip roller.|$|R
