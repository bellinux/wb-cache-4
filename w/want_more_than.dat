500|$|A {{week after}} the novel was {{published}} in the United Kingdom, The Guardian ran an article about French best-sellers published in English, focusing on The Elegance of the Hedgehog. In it, writer Alison Flood contended that [...] "fiction in translation is not an easy sell to Brits, and French fiction is perhaps the hardest sell of all". Promotions buyer Jonathan Ruppin predicted that the novel would struggle to gain a readership in the United Kingdom because, according to him, in the UK market [...] "the plot is what people <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything else" [...] and the novel's storyline is not its central aspect.|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{has written}} for Wired, {{outlining}} {{the relative merits of}} different distribution models with this one reflecting his [...] "self-distributionmodel" [...] in which [...] "the artist stands to receive the largest percentage of income from sales per unitâ€”sales of anything. A larger percentage of fewer sales, most likely, but not always. Artists doing it for themselves can actually make more money than the massive popstar, even though the sales numbers may seem minuscule by comparison." [...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I sense {{that a lot of people}} don't know we have a record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's easy for music to get lost out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|E

They don't know what affordability rules are; they don't know when penalties may apply. They just don't know. While Baucus was very supportive of the intent of the new legislation saying [...] "I spent two years of my life working on the Affordable Care Act.

Lt. General Shaul Mofaz, the IDF's Chief of the General Staff, regarded the camps as [...] "evidence of the risks of a new Palestinian upheaval". The Arafat aide who oversees the camps compared the camps to the Israeli Gadna corps for teenagers and said [...] "We hope that we will achieve our rights through negotiations, so that summer camps like these will cease to exist. ...

2500|$|In January 2011, the Armenian National Cinema Center {{announced}} that it was holding talks with world-known film director Steven Spielberg and Armenian American screenwriter Steven Zaillian to produce a full-length feature film about the Armenian Genocide. The cinema center director Gevorg Gevorgyan stated that [...] "On the 100th anniversary of the Genocide, we must have a film to demonstrate to the world. We <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the films Mayrig or Ararat." [...] Over a year later, in February 2012 the center declined the claims that Spielberg is involved in producing such on the 100th anniversary of the genocide. Vardan Abovian, the deputy director of the Armenian National Film Academy, said that they [...] "indeed have plans on a movie on the Armenian genocide, however, this is still in the 'idea' phase and nothing has been decided yet. We are trying to find the budget." [...] Ruzanna Bagratunyan, spokesperson for the center, stated that the movie [...] "is a huge load of work, and {{we are trying to do}} it in time; all of us understand what this date [...] means for the whole Armenian nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late August, Williams {{was hitting}} [...]402. Williams said that [...] "just about {{everybody}} was rooting for me" [...] to hit [...]400 in the season, including Yankee fans, who gave pitcher Lefty Gomez a [...] "hell of a boo" [...] after walking Williams with {{the bases loaded}} after Williams had gotten three straight hits one game in September. In mid-September, Williams was hitting [...]413, but dropped a point a game from then on. Before the final two games on September 28, a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, he was batting [...]39955, which would have been officially rounded up to [...]400. Red Sox manager Joe Cronin offered him the chance to sit out the final day, but he declined. [...] "If I'm going to be a [...]400 hitter", he said at the time, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> my toenails on the line." [...] Williams went 6-for-8 on the day, finishing the season at [...]406. (Sacrifice flies were counted as at-bats in 1941; under today's rules, Williams would have hit between [...]411 and [...]419, based on contemporaneous game accounts.) [...] Philadelphia fans ran out on the field to surround Williams after the game, forcing him to protect his hat from being stolen; he was helped into the clubhouse by his teammates. Along with his [...]406 average, Williams also hit 37 home runs and batted in 120 runs, missing the triple crown by five RBI.|$|E
2500|$|David H. Moffat and his {{business}} associates established the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway. It originated in Denver, and was planned to terminate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Construction began on December 18, 1902. [...] The DN started north up the Front Range of the Rockies towards Boulder. This ascent {{to the point where}} the line turned west, is a great example of exceptional mountain railroad surveying. Chief Engineer H.A. Sumner, needing to enter South Boulder Canyon as high as possible, did not <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a 2% grade. To do this, he laid out an efficient route to gain the necessary altitude that features the now famous Big Ten Curve. The climb to the Continental Divide required 33 tunnels that were several hundred feet long. The tracks did not reach the western end of the Tolland area until 1903. Once completed, the 33 tunnels between Denver and Tolland are closer together than any other tunnels on any other line in the US. Rollins Pass was next over the divide at Corona, at an elevation , and then the line went down the western face of the divide. Originally, Moffat had planned to build a tunnel through the worst part of the pass, but his plans failed. Instead, the DNW tracks climbed Rollins Pass with a series of switch back loops requiring steep grades and experiencing severe snow conditions. The line over the pass was [...] long, with a 4% grade at many locations, and was the highest mainline railroad ever constructed in North America (the Argentine Central terminated at a higher elevation). A small rail stop called Corona was established at the top of the pass, with a restaurant and lodging, which allowed workers to keep the rail line free of snow in Winter. Trains were often stranded for several days during heavy Winter snows. Removing snow from the original line made it unprofitable to operate.|$|E
