5|$|The {{son of the}} {{governor}} of Bust, Maymandi was raised as the foster brother of the Ghaznavid prince Mahmud, and would first start his administrative career {{as the head of}} the department of correspondence of Khorasan. He would thereafter rapidly rise to higher offices, finally becoming the vizier of the Ghaznavid dynasty in 1013, which would last until 1024, when he was arrested due to the great amount of <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> he had gained, which the suspicious Mahmud disliked.|$|E
5|$|During the Han Dynasty, silk became {{progressively}} more valuable {{in its own}} right, and became more than simply a material. It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold, {{the length of the}} silk cloth became a monetary standard in China (in addition to bronze coins). The <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E

5|$|Sir Walter Hungerford died in 1516, leaving Farleigh Hungerford Castle to his son, Sir Edward. Edward was a {{successful}} member of Henry VIII's court and died in 1522, leaving the castle to his second wife, Agnes. After Edward's death, however, it emerged that Agnes had {{been responsible for the}} murder of her former, first husband, John Cotell: two of her servants had strangled him at Farleigh Hungerford Castle, before burning his body in the castle oven to destroy any evidence. Agnes appears to have been motivated by a desire for the <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> would follow her second marriage to Sir Edward, but in 1523 Agnes and the two servants were hung for murder in London.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the general}} public of the United States was aware of oil {{production}} in Texas, the <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> it generated in the state {{for the first three}} decades after Spindletop was largely unknown. Of the four most prominent oil businessmen in Texas at the end of World War II— Murchison, Cullen, Richardson, and Hunt— only three articles about them appeared in the New York Times during their lifetime, despite their philanthropy and influence in Washington D.C. Stereotypes about Texas in the American imagination generally revolved around cowboys and cattle.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{believed}} that, {{by establishing}} a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral Ottoman Empire), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against British India, possibly {{in conjunction with the}} Tipu Sultan of Seringapatam, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, {{an essential part of the}} British Empire whose trade generated the <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at Toulon. He also formed the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{there are}} four parts of the economy: Business, Household, Public, and Non-profit. Typically, we only think that the {{business}} sector creates any <b>wealth,</b> and <b>that</b> the other three serve the business sector and alongside it. The truth is that all four parts of the economy generate <b>wealth,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> flows over into other sections of the economy as well. Part {{of the reason that}} unpaid care work is largely ignored is because of this belief that the household does not form wealth. In reality, the household prepares children for the other parts of the economy, and without that, none of the other sectors would flourish.|$|R

5|$|Genoa was {{important}} {{in the politics of}} 12th-century Europe. The Genoese were a nation of merchants, and such was their <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> they frequently fulfilled a role as bankers to the other nation states. However, the Genoese became divided following the rift caused when the Emperor Frederick II challenged the power of Pope Innocent IV. Two distinct camps formed: the Guelphs who supported the pope and the Ghibellines who were loyal to the imperial crown. Siding with the Guelphs were one of the patrician families of Genoa—the Grimaldi. Throughout the 13th century these two groups fought. Finally {{at the end of the}} century the Ghibellines were victorious and banished their opponents, including the Grimaldi, from Genoa. The Grimaldi settled in the area today known as the French Riviera. Several castles in the area are still known as Chateau Grimaldi, and testify to the strong presence of various branches of the family in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Bath was ravaged in {{the power}} {{struggle}} between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087. The victor, William II Rufus, granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, {{as well as the}} city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot, Ælfsige, and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey's <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the city. In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but {{it was part of a}} pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese. John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions. Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells– a comparatively small settlement– to the then walled city of Bath.|$|E

Narada (Sivaji Ganesan), a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the argument by visiting Saraswati (Savitri), the Goddess of knowledge, and annoys Her on purpose by saying <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> is more important and abundant. Angered by this, Saraswati states She will prove that knowledge is more important. Narada then goes to Vaikuntha to see Lakshmi (Devika), the Goddess of <b>wealth,</b> and says <b>that</b> knowledge is more abundant. Lakshmi also retorts She will prove <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> is more important. Narada finally goes to Mount Kailash, seeking Parvati (Padmini), the goddess of strength, and annoys Her too by saying <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> and knowledge are more important. Parvati too stresses that strength is more important.|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} "Yard-Sale Model" of <b>wealth</b> distribution posits <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> {{is transferred}} between economic agents {{as a result}} of transactions whose size is proportional to the wealth of the less wealthy agent. In recent work [B. M. Boghosian, "Kinetics of Wealth and the Pareto Law," Phys. Rev.

With the addition of a mechanism for wealth redistribution, it was further shown that this model results in stationary <b>wealth</b> distributions <b>that</b> are very similar in form to Pareto's well known law. In this paper, a much simpler derivation of that Fokker-Planck equation is presented. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
