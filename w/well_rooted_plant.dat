40|$|A simple {{micropropagation}} protocol {{has been}} achieved using nodal region and apical leaf of Clerodendrum indicum,(L) kuntze; an important medicinal plant of Verbenaceae. The explants were cultured in MS medium supplemented with NAA, BA, 2, 4 -D,Kn, IBA in various combination and concentrations (0. 1 - 10. 0 µM). Response to callogenesis were diverse, ranging from white vigorous compact callus (1. 0 µM NAA), compact green calli in NAA:BA (0. 5 : 0. 1 µM) & (1. 0 : 1. 0 µM), white compact calli (1. 0 : 3. 0 µM) NAA: Kn. Only 2, 4 D expectedly generated profuse watery, vigorous, friable calli (1. 0 µM). The nodal region was differentiated into shoot directly in combinations with NAA and BA(0. 1 : 1. 0 µM, 1. 0 : 3. 0 µM, 0. 5 : 1. 0 µM, 0. 1 : 0. 5 µM). Multiple shooting were generated in NAA: BA combination (0. 5 : 0. 3 µM). Moderate rooting were initiated at high IBA level in (10 µM) in full strength MS Medium. Simultaneous emergence of root & shoot were noticed from callus in triple combination of NAA, BA and IBA,in triple combination(5. 0 : 1. 0 : 1. 0 µM). The <b>well</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>plant</b> were transferred in the sterile soilrite covered with polybag in the culture room for acclimatization for 15 days. Such plants were transferred into the pot with 90 % survivality. This is the maiden report of micropropagation of Clerodendrum indicum(L.) Kuntze...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of regeneration and transformation experiments of 12 Polish cultivars of potato. The cultivars Brda, Bzura, Elipsa and Irga regenerated the highest number of shoots from leaf explants (60 % to 100 % of explants regenerated 4. 9 to 16. 5 shoots per explant). The cultivars Brda, Bzura, Elipsa and Irys were the source of the best regenerating tuber explants (66 % to 100 % of explants regenerated 6. 2 to 11. 9 shoots from one explant). Both types of explants (from leaves and tubers) were used for transformation experiments. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains used for transformation contained binary vector system: LBA 4404 (pAL 4404 :pBI 121) and C 58 C 1 (pGV 2260 :pVU 104).

40|$|The present {{research}} work involves shoot formation, their multiplication and rooting in carnation Dianthus caryophyllous. For shoot formation both apical and nodal meristems were used. MS medium containing BAP {{alone or in}} combination with kinetin was tested. Best shoot formation response was obtained after 6 days of inoculation from apical meristem and after 7 days of inoculation from nodal meristem on MS medium supplemented with 4. 0 mg/l BAP. Apical meristem showed more pronounced effect for shoot formation than nodal meristem. Well-developed shoots were shifted for their multiplication. Maximum number of multiple shoots were obtained on MS medium containing 1. 0 mg/l BAP. These multiple shoots increased in their number when were given subsequent incubation period. Addition of Kinetin to BAP failed to show good shoot multiplication response. Shoots after attaining the size of 5. 0 cm were shifted for rooting.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} in order to micropropagate the critically endangered Balkan endemic Dianthus ingoldbyi and to investigate the anatomical and morphological characteristic of shoots following the slowing down {{of the growth of}} in vitro shoots under cold and dark conditions. For this purpose, axillary buds isolated from aseptic seedlings were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium including 1 mg/L Benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0. 3 mg/L Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and a regeneration ratio of 84. 8 % was obtained. The number of shoots per explant was 5. 9 after 30 days from culture initial and the mean shoot length was 3. 6 cm. These shoots were transferred to MS medium including 0. 5 mg/L NAA and stored at 4 oC in a refrigerator in total darkness for 1 - 6 months without subculturing. 58 % of shoots survived after 6 months of cold storage conditions. Growth of shoots was significantly slowed down and there was no anatomical or morphological deformation {{at the end of the}} experimental period. Shoots transferred to normal conditions from cold storage developed better than the control group. <b>Well</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>plants</b> were acclimatized to outdoor conditions with a survival rate of 48 %.

50|$|However, caliche also {{forms in}} other ways. It can form when water rises through {{capillary}} action. In an arid region, rainwater sinks {{into the ground}} very quickly.
