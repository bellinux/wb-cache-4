5|$|Formula, Vol. 1 {{contains}} fifteen tracks, most {{of which}} were written by Romeo Santos and co-produced by Ivan Chevere. Santos said that he intended to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> English-language recordings on the album but did not want to stray far from his musical origins. The songs were recorded at The Castle, Fight Klub, and EMG Studios in New York City.|$|E
5|$|This episode, {{inspired}} by the 1982 horror film The Entity, was written due to insistence that the creators <b>write</b> <b>more</b> episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This allowed the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
50|$|A 2005 {{study found}} that using TDD meant <b>writing</b> <b>more</b> tests and, in turn, programmers who <b>wrote</b> <b>more</b> tests {{tended to be more}} productive. Hypotheses {{relating}} to code quality and a more direct correlation between TDD and productivity were inconclusive.|$|R

5|$|Although Stoenescu was {{a disciple}} of his, Macedonski favored Caion in this dispute, and {{employed}} him to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> denunciations of Caragiale {{in the magazine}} Forța Morală. Forța Morală expanded on the initial accusations, claiming to have discovered an entire history of plagiarism in Caragiale's writings (from Victorien Sardou to Alfred Duru). Following Macedonski's intercession, Caion was also supported by the historian Grigore Tocilescu, who made Caragiale the sole topic of his Romanian Atheneum conference (January 24, 1902).|$|E
5|$|Following this success, Lhasa toured with Lilith Fair, {{then joined}} her sisters in a French circus troupe, {{contributing}} her husky {{voice to the}} musical backdrop. She lived in Marseille and began to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> songs, then moved back to Montreal and produced a second album, The Living Road. Once again, she toured in support of her album, and she collaborated with other musicians on their projects. During this time, BBC Radio 3 honored her as the best world music artist of the Americas in 2005. She published a book about her impressions {{of life on the}} road.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Summer Cooking, David was wooed away from her regular column in Harpers by Vogue magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> personal columns than she had done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E

5|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Megadeth's fifth studio album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California. Max Norman {{was chosen to}} produce the album, as the band was pleased with his mixing of Rust in Peace. Megadeth spent nearly four months {{in the studio with}} Norman, writing and recording what became the band's most commercially successful effort, Countdown to Extinction. The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member. Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> melodic songs.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} created on Fox's {{insistence that the}} creators <b>write</b> <b>more</b> episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This episode was written to {{accomplish}} that, and to allow the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind. Co-writer Glen Morgan claims the episode {{was inspired by the}} movie The Entity. The name Tom Braidwood, the show's assistant director who later played Lone Gunmen member Melvin Frohike, is used in the scene where the parking lot attendant paints over the name of Howard Graves. The episode featured guest appearances by Barry Primus, Lisa Waltz, Lorena Gale and Veena Sood.|$|E
5|$|The author {{noted that}} the {{character}} of Lavi was popular with fans, placing third in a poll (behind Allen and Kanda) despite infrequent appearances in later story arcs, and she promised that Lavi would return. The story arc involving Alma Karma, featuring several characters, was difficult for the author; as a result, the next arc in which Allen leaves the Black Order contained fewer characters per chapter due to its different format. The character of Apocryphos was introduced to hint at the Heart, a plot element briefly described in a past storyline which would later reappear. Due to Jump Square (the manga's magazine at the time) readership—older men, rather than children—Hoshino found Allen the most difficult character to write. She does not want Allen's problems in recent story arcs to lead to portraying him as a troubled teenager, preferring to show him as a cheerful person with a balance of strength and sorrow. After D.Gray-man dark narrative, Hoshino plans to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> lighthearted series in the future.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37, Masashi Kishimoto stated that he enjoys drawing Lee {{more than any other}} character in the series. When designing Lee's appearance, Kishimoto intended to have Lee wield a variety of weapons, including nunchaku; however, due to time constraints while creating the series, he was unable to do so. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, originally drew the author a draft of Lee's appearance. While the design highly changed from its draft to the original one when Kishimoto designed it, Yahagi felt pleased because some parts were kept. Kishimoto has noted that he originally designed Lee to symbolize human weakness; Kishimoto's design of Sakura Haruno was also intended to carry the same symbolism. Kishimoto was surprised by Lee's popularity within fans. He intended to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> about him but the timing was never right. Due to the popularity Lee garnered {{over the course of the}} series, Kishimoto tends to place him towards the front of promotional artwork in which he appears.|$|E

25|$|The Runaway enjoyed 17 {{performances}} {{during its}} first season at Drury Lane and 39 in London by 1800, a success that encouraged Cowley to <b>write</b> <b>more,</b> even though her mentor Garrick retired after the 1776 season. She wrote her next two plays, the farce Who’s the Dupe? and the tragedy Albina, before the year was out.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before his}} sudden {{departure}} from writing Bond novels {{at the start}} of 2003, Benson had indicated his intention to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> short pieces and publish a short story collection along the lines of Fleming's For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy and The Living Daylights. This, however, has yet to occur as of 2008.|$|E
25|$|After Barks's retirement, the {{character}} continued under other artists. In 1972, Barks was persuaded to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> stories for Disney. He wrote Junior Woodchuck stories where Scrooge often plays {{the part of}} the villain, closer to the role he had before he acquired his own series. Under Barks, Scrooge always was a malleable character who would take on whatever persona was convenient to the plot.|$|E

25|$|With extreme sarcasm, Muratori ridicules {{not only}} {{the subject of the}} book, but also the style as well. Granting Kenney stylistic ability, he takes it to a level of sarcasm by {{comparing}} Orrery to a display of fireworks. It is overly bombastic in opinion because of its briefness. Were he able to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> and include more analytic evidence, this review might not be a bad source for negative criticism.|$|E
25|$|Ariosto {{continued}} to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> {{material for the}} poem and in the 1520s he produced five more cantos, marking a further development of his poetry, which {{he decided not to}} include in the final edition. They were published after his death by his illegitimate son Virginio under the title Cinque canti and are highly regarded by some modern critics. The third and final version of Orlando Furioso, containing 46 cantos, appeared in 1532.|$|E
25|$|In 2010–2011, Bryan Erickson {{teamed up}} with William Anderson of Louisiana. William did a ton of sampling, Bryan made a bunch of VAC B-sides and turned them into Toxic Coma tracks. The project is very old with a {{revolving}} door of members, again Bryan being the main constant. This LP fuses the techno sound of Fun With Knives and the brutal black humor of Toxic Coma. This VAC side project is known as Toxic Coma Satan Rising, on Metropolis Records. Erickson then began to <b>write</b> <b>more</b> music for future VAC LPs.|$|E
