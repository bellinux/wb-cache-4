In this research, we examine the effects of this inconsistency on prediction performance using two machine learning methods, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) regression and Generalized Regression Neural Network, in order to identify an approach towards tackling the proper-inconsistency problem in weldability prediction.

40|$|International audienceIn {{solid-state}} welding, temperature {{generally has}} an important role (diffusion, recrystallization, etc.) however, a mechanical loading is also necessary for breaking down the thin oxide layer (Al 2 O 3) which naturally covers aluminium alloys. As the oxide layers have a melting point of around 2000  °C meanwhile aluminium alloys generally melt at only 600  °C; the heat supply alone cannot lead to the welding and a mechanical loading is always needed. This work aims at understanding {{the influence of the}} mechanical loadings on the formation of metallic bonds. To this end a new <b>weldability</b> <b>test</b> has been introduced.

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{hydrogen}} assisted cold cracking in {{high strength steel}} weld metal during flux cored arc welding (FCAW) using a technique involving the deliberate introduction of hydrogen into the CO 2 shielding gas. A specific objective was to investigate weld metal cold cracking susceptibility by development of a research tool which permitted control over both the weld metal diffusible hydrogen content and the stress applied during mechanical testing of single bead on plate weld deposits. The basis for this undertaking is twofold, and {{stems from the fact}} that crack mitigating measures traditionally address cracking in the heat affected zone, although it has been shown that weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking is more likely when strength matching weld metals are used to join high strength low alloy steels. As a result existing <b>weldability</b> <b>test</b> methods have a limited ability to simulate weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking. The literature relevant to hydrogen assisted cold cracking (HACC) has been reviewed, and the current understanding and assertions relating to HACC have been detailed. The primary findings are that this form of cracking in high strength steel weld metal occurs by localised plastic deformation, which eventually results in fracture through bands of intense shear. The increase in alloying elements and the as-cast nature of the weld metal are also recognised as two key reasons why cracking has migrated from the heat affected zone into the weld metal. Current welding standards and recognised <b>weldability</b> <b>test</b> methods have also been reviewed to establish the techniques and engineering guidance available. This review indicates that the majority of test methods and all of the welding standards are heat affected zone specific A further revelation is that <b>weldability</b> <b>test</b> methods typically function as a ranking tool and offer limited scope to serve as a research tool. The initial experimental investigation of multipass welds in thick plate revealed that the majority of weld metal cold cracking occurred within 48 hours of weld completion. Crack detection was also recorded several days after welding had ceased, indicating that the diffusion, trapping and stress-strain conditions of solute hydrogen contribute significantly to crack initiation and propagation. Self restraint multipass weld techniques were then considered as a means of generating weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking test data. Subsequent research also evaluated tensile and bend testing to develop cracking in single bead on plate weld deposits. The analysis of the requirements to generate cracking in both single and multipass welds was then used to produce a single bead, applied stress test which preferentially targeted the weld metal. The test methods developed during the experimental phase subsequently allowed manipulation of the diffusible hydrogen content and the magnitude of the applied stress, which in turn facilitated weld metal cold cracking under controlled conditions. The test specimens were produced by depositing high strength ferritic weld metal onto a strength matched martensitic base material via an automated flux cored arc welding process. In order to increase the susceptibility to cracking, 2 % and 5 %H 2 was deliberately added to the CO 2 shielding gas. Both tensile and 4 -point bend testing of single pass weld deposits were evaluated, although 4 -point bending was ultimately selected as the most suitable test method providing preferential targeting of the weld metal. Standard bead on plate and geometrically modified bead on plate specimen geometries were employed during testing. These were assessed according to their functionality, machinability and reproducibility of the results generated. Rising load and stress controlled test configurations were applied to observe the behaviour of the weld metal mechanical properties. Although the test configurations permitted close control over the test variables (hydrogen, stress, microstructure and time), the results indicated that variations in cold cracking delay times will occur under near identical test conditions. The variations observed are explained in terms of differences in the transport and trapping behaviour of hydrogen in the heterogeneous structure of the weld metal. The inability to generate closely matching cold cracking delay times under matching conditions suggests that a single time to fracture cannot be realised for the test conditions employed. It is therefore proposed that a maximum delay time after which fracture will not occur be used as a research outcome, instead of defining specific or closely matching delay times. Metallographic analysis of the test specimens was also conducted to determine the effect of hydrogen on the evolution of the microstructure and to establish the fracture morphology. Image analysis revealed that a reduction of non-metallic inclusions occurred during welding with hydrogen-rich shielding gas. The introduction of hydrogen into the shielding gas also resulted in a coarsening of the general microstructure, believed to be the product of reduced acicular ferrite nucleation, allowing individual grains to coarsen without being impeded by the growth of nearby nucleated grains. The morphology of the fractures observed under microscopy and their reliance on the introduction of hydrogen in the shielding gas indicated that the fractures were typical of those produced under weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking conditions. Ductile tearing, microvoid coalescence, quasi cleavage and cleavage fracture facets were observed along the fracture path. The cracks were observed to have propagated along both the columnar solidification structure and along the prior austenite grain boundaries. Microcracks were also observed on the fracture faces, which are believed to have contributed to the final fracture by means of crack-linkage. Higher concentrations of impurity elements were also observed on the boundary along which the cracks had propagated. The typical region from which cracking would originate was associated with second phase constituents and low grain boundary ferrite content. Whilst it was not possible to develop a quantitative test for hydrogen cracking susceptibility; the reasons for the test variability have been explored and show that the interaction of hydrogen with microstructural development may play a significant role in WM HACC susceptibility...|$|E

40|$|Superalloys and in {{particular}} the precipitation hardened Ni-based superalloys have always been used extensively in the hot sections of jet engines. Large hot structural engine components with complex geometry have preferably been cast as single piece components since the large scale vacuum investment casting process became available about fifty years ago. However, a recent trend is to cast smaller pieces which can be joined with sheet or forged parts to fabricate structural components. The rationale for this fabrication strategy is the possibility to save weight by the use of higher strength wrought material, where geometry allows, and join these wrought parts with cast material where complex geometry is needed and where the demand for strength is moderate. One of the major challenges using this strategy is the obvious fact that numerous welds must be made which requires the fundamental understanding, not least metallurgical, of how different materials may be joined by specific welding processes. The main objective of this research has, for this reason, been to examine and interpret the weldability of precipitation hardened superalloys from a metallurgical standpoint. Two newly developed superalloys Allvac® 718 PlusTM and Haynes® 282 ® are compared with the two well established Alloy 718 and Waspaloy. The understanding of the influence of secondary phases such as carbides and δ phase in the microstructure was addressed by systematic hot ductility testing (Gleeble) and by <b>weldability</b> <b>testing</b> (Varestraint). The effect of secondary phases were also analysed through practical welding as by electron beam welding (EBW), and by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). The research showed that all the techniques used (Varestraint testing, Gleeble testing, DSC thermal analysis and welding (GTAW repair and EBW)) in studying the weldability independently provided important knowledge and most importantly that a combination of the results from these different techniques were necessary for the understanding of the weldability of these four alloys. From a microstructural point of view it has been possible to show that δ phase contrary to what has generally been assumed improves the weldability due to its ability to inhibit grain growth and to assist in the healing of cracks.

40|$|In {{aerospace}} industry {{there are several}} complex geometries to be fabricated {{with only a few}} companies that posses the skills to cast or forge the complex Nickel-based superalloys. The aim is to find an alternative manufacturing approach to avoid the monopoly on the market, and still have the same or better standard of the product. Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC), has turned to the idea of welding cast, wrought and forged segments together with complex geometry that are to be utilized as structural components in the hot rear end of a jet engine. By that {{it goes without saying that}} knowledge and control of the welding process is of great importance. VAC have designed and developed a simulative <b>weldability</b> <b>test,</b> a so called Varestraint machine, to run real-life testing on plates by applying augmented strain and welding simultaneously. The aim is to fundamentally study the cracks by forcing them to occur. The purpose of this master thesis was to design and validate a thermo-mechanical model (TMM), by using finite element analysis and evaluate the physics why the cracks propagate. The material of interest is a solution heat treated Ni-based superalloy named Haynes® 282 ®. The thesis is divided into two parts, Part I that describes the creation of the TMM. Part II contains a method for finding a crack criterion. The work has included convergence tests, validation with real tests, developing material data, analyzes of the test plate geometries and configurations for the Varestraint test. In addition, real tests with the VAC Varestraint test has been performed and simulated to gain information about what strains and temperatures that the specimen endures during the welding procedure. This analysis has been correlated with the cracking results of the real tests. The real tests were carried out with the aim to find the threshold strain for cracking which is the maximum strain for where cracking do not occur. The main result of this thesis is an accurate and validated thermo-mechanical model of the Varestraint test. The augmented threshold strain for Haynes® 282 ® in Varestraint testing was found. It was concluded that the local strain during a Varestraint test was significantly higher than the predefined augmented strain that has been widely used in the past to represent a materials resistance to weld cracking. Further conclusions is that the simulated local strains at the trailing edge of the weld pool are not applicable to use for a crack initiation criterion due to the simplifications, as simulating the weld pool as a solid for example...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{introduced}} during {{shielded metal}} arc welding with cellulosic welding consumables can severely degrade the fracture resistance of the deposited weld metal and promote Weld Metal Hydrogen Assisted Cold Cracking (WM HACC), which is {{a particular type of}} weld defect with distinctive characteristics. Failure typically occurs after the deposited weld has cooled down to temperatures below 200 °C and can initiate within minutes to even days after welding. Due to its time-delayed nature the onset of WM HACC may be undetected and can result in catastrophic failure. Many important properties of weld metal such as strength, toughness and the resistance to WM HACC are a function of its microstructure, comprised of diverse constituents with characteristic features and different mechanical properties, which co-exist and interact at the smallest microstructural dimensions. Hence, conventional test methods used to determine the bulk material’s properties are not suitable to evaluate the intrinsic properties of its individual microstructural constituents. Because of these experimental limitations, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of microstructural aspects that control the mechanical properties and the resistance to HACC at the micro-scale. Therefore, a major objective of the current work was to address these limitations by employing advanced characterisation and micro-mechanical testing techniques to evaluate the fundamental link between microstructure, mechanical properties and HACC susceptibility for individual weld metal microstructural constituents. This first part of the work examined the microstructure and mechanical properties of acicular ferrite and upper bainite in weld metal. Two localised microstructural regions, one acicular ferrite and the other one upper bainite, were first selected and then characterised using a high-resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). Semi-empirical models, based on microstructural aspects and physical principles, were used to determine the theoretical yield strengths of both microstructures. Different micromechanical tests were then conducted within each of the initially selected microstructural regions to characterise their intrinsic mechanical properties. Conventional nanoindentation and an advanced characterisation procedure were employed to obtain the yield strength, hardness, elastic modulus and strain hardening exponent. Micro-fracture tests in combination with linear and non-linear approaches of fracture mechanics were used to evaluate the deformation behaviour, fracture behaviour and fracture resistance. This study provided experimental evidence for a direct link between the microstructure and yield strength of acicular ferrite and upper bainite. It was thereby possible to identify the individual contributions of particular microstructural features. Furthermore, the relationship between strength, hardness and toughness was evaluated for both microstructures and the elastic and plastic components of their CTOD’s, could be identified. The results also showed that the fracture toughness values measured in microscopic regions of acicular ferrite and upper bainite were at least by an order of magnitude lower than the typical range for the fracture toughness of steels, obtained from conventional fracture tests. This may result from the fact that micro-fracture tests imply small specimen dimensions, which could cause a confinement of plastic deformations that contribute significantly to the fracture resistance. The results may also indicate that not all fracture toughening mechanisms are activated at the micro-scale. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the fracture toughness values measured in this work, for a relatively ductile material, are higher than those reported for brittle and semi-brittle materials, tested with similar methods at the micro-scale. In the current literature, at such small scales, no empirical data on the fracture toughness of specific microstructural constituents in weld metal is available. Hence, it was not possible to directly verify the results. The second part of the work examined the microstructure and HACC propagation resistance of acicular ferrite and upper bainite in weld metal. A modified version of the Welding Institute of Canada (WIC) <b>weldability</b> <b>test</b> was employed to generate WM HACC under controlled conditions. The hydrogen crack propagation through selected microstructural regions of acicular ferrite and upper bainite was then characterised using EBSD. Where The Unit Crack Path (UCP) was utilised as a parameter to evaluate the HACC propagation resistance of both microstructures. Fractographic observations were conducted with a high resolution SEM, to characterise the fracture behaviour in the selected microstructural regions. The investigations showed that HACC propagates along a path of least resistance through the surrounding microstructure, where the UCP was significantly shorter for acicular ferrite than for upper bainite, thereby implying more frequent changes in direction and thus increased dissipation of energy from the crack driving force. The results indicate that acicular ferrite, increases the localised resistance to HACC propagation more than upper bainite, despite its higher strength, hardness and lower fracture toughness, which are all properties usually considered to be detrimental for the HACC resistance of the bulk material. The outcomes of this study suggest that macroscopic observations of the correlation between mechanical properties and HACC susceptibility are not necessarily applicable at the micro-scale. Which also implies that mechanical properties per se are not a good indicator of absolute HACC susceptibility and in fact may be misleading in terms of the intrinsic susceptibility of particular microstructural constituents. The third part of the work examined the microstructure and HACC initiation resistance of acicular ferrite in weld metal. A selected microscopic region of acicular ferrite was characterised using a high resolution SEM in combination with EBSD. Micro-fracture tests were then conducted at different loads on a hydrogen pre-charged specimen, that was fabricated into the selected region with a Focused Ion Beam (FIB). Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) was applied to determine the range for the threshold stress intensity factor, Kth, to initiate HACC. The microstructure, deformation behaviour as well as the fracture behaviour were examined and compared with the data obtained from first part of the work, where a micro fracture test was conducted on an uncharged specimen, that was fabricated into the same region of acicular ferrite. This study showed that the obtained range for the threshold stress intensity factor of acicular ferrite was well below the threshold values for weld metal as well as low and medium carbon steels with similar yield strengths. This indicates that, at the micro-scale, hydrogen cracks can grow at stress intensity factors well below the threshold values measured with conventional tests at the macro-scale. It seems that also in this case critical fracture toughening mechanisms may not be activated if the specimen dimensions are very small. The crack growth rate in acicular ferrite, also appeared to be significantly lower than typically observed for the bulk material. Besides plastic deformations during fracture and the threshold stress intensity to initiate fracture, the yield strength and the Young’s modulus also decreased due to the presence of hydrogen, which correlates well with previous observations and proposed hydrogen embrittlement models.

Immersion corrosion tests were performed on all-weld-metal coupons of C- 2000 alloy in various envi-ronments, including hydrochloric, hydro-fluoric, and sulfuric acids, with other Ni-Cr-Mo alloys included for comparison. The resistance of C- 2000 alloy to solidifi-cation cracking was similar to other Ni-Cr-Mo alloys that {{are considered to be}} quite weldable, including C- 22 ® and C- 276. Alloy C- 2000 differs from other modern Ni-Cr-Mo alloys in that it contains 1. 6 wt- % copper. Copper does not have a detrimental effect on the resistance of the alloy to solidification cracking. C- 2000 alloy weld metal met the minimum tensile strength requirements of the base metal and was very ductile, passing 2 T and 1. 5 T transverse bend tests. The corrosion rate of Alloy C- 2000 weld metal was lower than that of the C- 276 and C- 22 alloys in hy-drochloric, hydrofluoric, and dilute sulfu-ric acids, {{similar to that of the}} C- 22 alloy in ASTM G 28 A solution, and similar to that of C- 276 alloy in ASTM G 28 B solu-tion and concentrated sulfuric acid...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s, the {{development}} of high-strength pipeline steels has followed the route of progressively reduced hardenability through lower carbon and alloying element contents. Microalloying, controlled rolling (CR), and thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) have been used extensively to achieve the high-strength and other material property requirements despite the trend towards lower carbon content. The primary {{driving force behind the}} evolution of these alloying and processing strategies stems from the concerns over the weldability, particularly the hydrogen assisted cracking (HAC), at ever-increasing strength levels. In doing so, the adverse effects of this steel making philosophy on the structural integrity and steel manufacturing cost have become more pronounced. The steels made using those processes can exhibit high yield to tensile ratio (low strain hardening), low uniform elongation, HAZ softening, and splitting; all of which tend to have detrimental effects on pipeline integrity. The objective of the work described here was to evaluate alternate steels with enhanced hardenability and identifying those that would have a potential to (1) meet the high strength/high toughness requirement but without the adverse effects of the early trial heats of microalloyed TMCP X 80 and X 100 linepipe steels, and (2) exhibit sufficient resistance to HAC. Three enhanced hardenability steels were evaluated through a full range of mechanical tests, metallurgical examination, and <b>weldability</b> <b>tests.</b> Although none of the three alternative steels met the full requirements of X 100 linepipe material, one of them showed good promise in meeting the X 100 linepipe material requirements...|$|R
40|$|Weld {{solidification}} cracking {{is an important}} issue in fusion welding. If undetected, the cracking defects can act as stress concentration sites which lead to premature failure via fatigue, as well as offer favourable sites for hydrogen assisted cracking and stress corrosion cracking. For welded steel products such as deep sea oil and gas transportation pipes, such defects heighten the risk of catastrophic in-service failures. Such failures can lead to devastating environmental, economic, and social damage. In this thesis, a comprehensive review of literature associated with steel linepipe and {{solidification cracking}} defects is first presented. Fluid flow prior to solidification is then observed and quantified in situ using a novel synchrotron X-ray radiography approach. The flow is dynamic at velocities up to 0. 52 m/s and primarily driven via Marangoni flow. The relationship between the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded linepipe are extensively characterised, with a new equation derived to assess fracture toughness based on the size and distribution of carbonitride precipitates. Weld residual stresses are measured both before and after linepipe expansion in the U-forming, O-forming and expansion process for the first time using a neutron diffraction technique. To further understand the fundamental mechanisms of solidification cracking during welding of high strength steels for subsea linepipe, a novel small-scale Varestraint test rig was developed for use in synchrotron X-ray imaging experiments and a Transvarestriant test rig utilised for industrial scale <b>weldability</b> <b>tests.</b> Solidification cracking during the welding of steel is observed in situ for the first time using a micro-radiography approach and the 3 D crack network is rebuilt using a micro-tomography technique. It is proposed that solidification cracks nucleate from sub-surface cavities associated with: i) residual liquid high in solute and impurity concentration (hot cracks), ii) Ti (C,N) precipitated during solidification (that induce ductile microvoids). Solidification cracks then propagate via inter-dendritic hot tearing...|$|R

GMA welding and two {{categories}} of strength of girth welded joints (100 - 110 % and 110 - 130 % of strength of base metal) have been adopted. The <b>weldability</b> <b>tests</b> of base metal as well as numerical modelling for welding process were also carried out. The results of the simulated HAZ confirmed that in the HAZ of the girth welded joints will have high fracture toughness, however, the cooling time t 8 / 5 should be under 10 s. Hardness in the simulated HAZ does not exceed 300 HV for real time value t 8 / 5 cooling occurring during welding, which indicates a low tendency to hardening of steel in the HAZ and hence a high resistance to cold cracking of steel. This was confirmed by the Tekken test. Even in the welding without preheating the cracks not occurred in the base metal and HAZ. The hardness was lower than 380 HV. Taken into account that the specific cooling time t 8 / 5 has to be lower than 10 s during welding API 5 L X 70 steel the numerical models were prepared in the Sysweld software and verified experimentally. The verification of the numerical modelling confirmed the compatibility of the models. Two welding filler metals were used to weld the preliminary welded joints as well as girth welded joints. The results of mechanical tests of the girth welded joints {{and the distribution of}} residual stress in welded joints were also presented. The results indicated that GMA allowed to achieved the proper girth welded joints from the quality and mechanical properties point of view...|$|R

The aim of the present study is to determine a relationship between filler metal dilution, local strain rate conditions, and cracking susceptibility.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) are being specified for chloride containing environments {{due to their}} enhanced pitting and stress corrosion cracking resistance. They exhibit improved corrosion performance over the austenitic {{stainless steels}}. Duplex stainless steels also offer improved strength properties and are available in various wrought and cast forms. Selected grades of duplex stainless steel castings and their welds, in comparison with their wrought counterparts, were evaluated, regarding corrosion performance and mechanical properties and weldability. Multiple heats of cast duplex stainless steel were evaluated in the as-cast, solution annealed (SA) static cast and SA centrifugal cast conditions, while their wrought counterparts were characterized in the SA condition and {{in the form of}} as-rolled plate. Welding, including extensive assessment of autogenous welds and a preliminary study of composite welds (shielded metal arc weld (SMAW)), was performed. The evaluations included critical pitting temperature (CPT) testing, intergranular corrosion (IGC) testing, ASTM A 923 (Methods A, B and C), Charpy impact <b>testing,</b> <b>weldability</b> <b>testing</b> (ASTM A 494), ferrite measurement and microstructural evaluations. In the study, the corrosion performances of DSS castings were characterized and assessed, including the wrought counterparts for comparison. The evaluation filled the pore of lack of data for cast duplex stainless steels compared to wrought materials. A database of the pitting corrosion and IGC behavior of cast and wrought materials was generated for a greater depth of understanding for the behavior of cast duplex stainless steel. In addition, improved evaluation methods for DSS castings were developed according to ASTM A 923, A 262, G 48 and A 494. The study revealed that when properly heat treated according to the specification, (1) DSS castings have equal or better pitting and intergranular corrosion resistance than their wrought counterparts; (2) Welding reduces the pitting and intergranular corrosion resistance for both the wrought and cast duplex alloys; (3) Castings generally have better toughness than their wrought counterparts in the temperature range of - 80 C to + 20 C; (4) All shield metal arc (SMA) test welds in DSS castings, with recommended or over matching filler metal, indicate that welding is not a significant factor when considering DSS applications...|$|R

On {{the other hand}} placement of a narrow strip of a third alloy between the two metals can introduce many technical and availability limitations. In this work, a more versatile method is developed using electrospark deposition (ESD) for facilitation of subsequent Nb to 410 stainless steel dissimilar laser with minimum heat input successfully. The 1 mm Nb plate edge was clad by Alloy 82 using a 4 mm round electrode by ESD process. The layer has minimum dilution with Nb while having a metallurgical bond. It exhibited a fine cellular structure with Laves phase particles with 30 – 50 nm in diameter.

40|$|Literature {{relevant}} to the weldability of steel by {{manual metal arc welding}} has been reviewed. In particular, the process of manual metal arc welding has been examined and current theoretical models that have been developed to predict the structure of the weldment are discussed. Weld defects, particularly hydrogen assisted cold cracking of the heat affected zone (HAZ) are discussed and a review of <b>weldability</b> <b>tests</b> relevent to HAZ cracking has been made. The Japanese developed Tekken Test has been examined in detail and the relevance of Cracking Index measurements has been analysed. The effects that variations to the extrinsic welding parameters of voltage, current, and speed on Cracking Index as determined by the Tekken Test have been examined. Intrinsic welding variables of microstructure and restraint stress have been examined using optical and electron microscopy and a restraint stress measuring technique. Cracking Index results have been related to the extrinsic welding parameters by variations caused to the intrinsic variables of microstructure and restraint stress. It was found that increases in welding speed and voltage increased the value of the Cracking Index and increases in welding current decreased the Cracking Index value. The interaction of these effects produced a variation of results for welding at constant heat input. All three extrinsic parameters were found, independently and collectively to affect the microstructures of both the HAZ and the weldmetal. It was found that increases in welding voltage and current and decreases in welding speed increased the volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the HAZ with an associated decrease in HAZ cracking. Cracking of the weldmetal was found {{to be related to the}} ferrite morphology; fine lath (acicular) ferrite was found to be the microstructure least susceptible to cracking. Formation of fine lath ferrite microstrucures was enhanced by low welding speeds. From the various combinations of weldmetal and HAZ microstructures that could be achieved a range of Cracking Index values could be produced. The influence that root gap of the test piece, the composition (carbon equivalent) of the steel plate, and the classification and manufacturing source of the electrodes had on Cracking Index has also been studied. Increasing root gap and carbon equivalent increased the value of Cracking Index although in the latter case the relationship varied with welding conditions. Cracking Index was also found to vary with electrodes of different classifications and from different manufacturing sources. It is proposed that these Cracking Index variations are attributable to strength incompatibilities and differences in electrode flux compositions respectively. It is concluded that because of the variation of results, often with considerable scatter, produced by the interaction of all the variables, the Tekken Test is not valid as a general method for determining weldability, but rather provides a useful comparative test of the responses of different steels and electrodes to welding under strictly specified welding conditions...|$|R

The performance, in this respect, {{of the most commonly}} used alloys at Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC), 718 and the higher temperature capacity Waspaloy, are therefore the main subjects for this thesis. The emerging Allvac 718 ® PLUSTM (718 Plus) is also included due to the prospect of replacing the expensive Waspaloy. The overall emphasis is on <b>weldability</b> through Varestraint <b>testing</b> but limited work was initially carried out on notch rupture sensitivity of 718 Plus. The notch rupture testing of 718 Plus emphasized the importance of the secondary phases like delta-phase in the grain boundaries. Hot cracks were observed in all alloys with re-solidified products on the liquated and re-solidified grain boundaries. Grain boundary liquation and segregation of alloying elements was considered to be the primary reason for liquation of HAZ grain boundaries which caused cracking. Evidence of constitutional liquation of Nb rich MC type carbides in alloy 718 and 718 Plus were found in the region adjacent to the fusion zone and also on the cracked grain boundaries. The resolidified products along the hot cracks consisted of γ + MC type carbide and γ + Laves eutectics...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen induced cold {{cracking}} in weldments {{is the most}} serious problem limiting the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of {{cold cracking}} in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of weld metal cold cracking becomes a major task since the risk of hydrogen induced cold cracking in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. Hydrogen induced cold cracking in weld metal is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which induces stresses, cold cracking in weld metal can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse cold cracking. The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on weld metal transverse cold cracking behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The minimum yield stress of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of weld metal cold cracking has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting hydrogen induced cold cracking. The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of weld metal have been examined. The main types of cold cracking and relevant <b>weldability</b> <b>tests</b> have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse cold cracking behaviour of the weld metal deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the weld metals, have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the weld metals have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base metal and the weld metals have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of weld metals. It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, weld metal transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 °C, confirming that the weld metal transverse cracking was cold cracking. Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the weld metals deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two weld metals, the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher oxygen absorption during welding resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the weld metal are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} weld metal transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in weld metal hardness (strength). The susceptibility to weld metal transverse cold cracking, based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 °C, but a preheat of 100 °C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower cold cracking susceptibility than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|R
40|$|A {{material}} that resists lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) attack and retains its strength at 700 °C {{would be an}} enabling technology for LBE-cooled reactors. No single alloy currently exists that can economically meet the required performance criteria of high strength and corrosion resistance. A Functionally Graded Composite (FGC) was created with layers engineered to perform these functions. F 91 {{was chosen as the}} structural layer of the composite for its strength and radiation resistance. Fe- 12 Cr- 2 Si, an alloy developed from previous work in the Fe-Cr-Si system, was chosen as the corrosion-resistant cladding layer because of its chemical similarity to F 91 and its superior corrosion resistance in both oxidizing and reducing environments. Fe- 12 Cr- 2 Si experienced minimal corrosion due to its self-passivation in oxidizing and reducing environments. Extrapolated corrosion rates are below one micron per year at 700 °C. Corrosion of F 91 was faster, but predictable and manageable. Diffusion studies showed that 17 microns of the cladding layer will be diffusionally diluted during the three year life of fuel cladding. 33 microns must be accounted for during the sixty year life of coolant piping. 5 cm coolant piping and 6. 35 mm fuel cladding were produced on a commercial scale by weld-overlaying Fe- 12 Cr- 2 Si onto F 91 billets and co-extruding them, followed by pilgering. An ASME certified weld was performed followed by the prescribed quench-and-tempering heat treatment for F 91. A minimal heat affected zone was observed, demonstrating field <b>weldability.</b> Finally, corrosion <b>tests</b> were performed on the fabricated FGC at 700 °C after completely breaching the cladding in a small area to induce galvanic corrosion at the interface. None was observed. This FGC has significant impacts on LBE reactor design. The increases in outlet temperature and coolant velocity allow a large increase in power density, leading to either a smaller core for the same power rating or more power output for the same size core. This FGC represents an enabling technology for LBE cooled fast reactors. by Michael Philip Short. Thesis (Ph. D.)
