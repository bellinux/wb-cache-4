He pinned him afterwards to win the match and the Cruiserweight Championship. Candice Michelle and Melina continued to feud over the WWE Women's Championship.

James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges.

50|$|Subset {{selection}} evaluates {{a subset}} of features as a group for suitability. Subset selection algorithms can be broken up into <b>Wrappers,</b> Filters and Embedded. <b>Wrappers</b> use a search algorithm to search through the space of possible features and evaluate each subset by running a model on the subset. <b>Wrappers</b> can be computationally expensive and have a risk of over fitting to the model. Filters are similar to <b>Wrappers</b> in the search approach, but instead of evaluating against a model, a simpler filter is evaluated. Embedded techniques are embedded in and specific to a model.|$|R
