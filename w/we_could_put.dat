25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a unary operation.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something, or just thinks that he or she has imagined it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we know that he has not." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{formidable}} array of run-getters who on past efforts appears to tower above everything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> in the field, {{and in the}} absence of O'Reilly the position seemed bleak and without hope. I asked Kippax what he thought...He said [...] "If Hutton, Compton and Hammond are anywhere near their pre-war form I would be willing to concede them 250 runs an innings and ask them not to bat".|$|E

2500|$|Wallner {{then turned}} his attentions to the {{animations}}. As all the animations {{in the game}} had to be interchangeable for every settler (walking, bending etc.), he first needed {{to work on the}} skeletal animation. Unsatisfied with the results when he attempted to use 3D Studio Max, he chose instead to build an [...] "extremely primitive skeletal settler which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> under the visible structure of our figures." [...] The drawback to this approach was that all actions had to animated separately, frame-by-frame.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist David Foot, the {{historian}} of Somerset cricket, wrote of Hunt {{that he had}} [...] "a healthy cynicism {{about the life of}} an expendable professional cricketer" [...] and that he [...] "preferred to stick to his weekend matches for his village team, Lodway". Foot added: [...] "His pals in the parish used to say of him: 'He had the most perfect temperament we ever came across – the bowler who never complained. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> down five catches off him, as we did more than once, and he merely smiled'." ...|$|E

[...] Because it's not a boarding house. It never was" [...] (53).|$|E

60|$|It is a wonderful, but at {{the same}} time, we think, a {{universal}} and important fact, that love permeates the universe. Even a female snail, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>put</b> the question, would undoubtedly admit that it loves its little ones.|$|R

The hotel was dirty and the bedrooms so unpleasant {{that we would have}} none of them, and sent Gorgonio to hunt for an empty room in which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> up our own beds. This he found in a [...] "meson", or caravanserai, attached to the hotel, where there was a goodsized room and a rough kitchen opening on a patio in which we could turn the beasts loose for the night. A sprinkling with water, a good sweeping,and a free use of Keating's powder, soon made the room habitable. The supper at the hotel was, however, far above the average, and the only thing to complain of was the poor forage supplied to the mules.".|$|E

Think up its name, will you. And <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> in nice desks and our boys in neat blue with diplomas {{on the walls and}} 1.knock psychotherapy into history and 2.make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3.keep the HAS solvent. It is a problem of practical business. I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. But I sure could make it stick. We're treating the present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain. And brother, that's religion, not mental science.|$|E
2500|$|In the album's liner notes, a mock {{definition}} is printed that explains that Radiosurgery is [...] "a medical procedure that allows non-invasive treatment used to target unwanted memories in the brain. Radiosurgery operates by directing highly focused waves of ionizing sound with high precision. It {{is a relatively}} recent technique (1997), which {{has been shown to}} be beneficial for the treatment of past regrets and lost love." [...] On August 2, the album's artwork and packaging details were released. It was confirmed that the album would be available in a number of formats, including a standard CD, a deluxe edition double CD featuring four exclusive b-sides, including a cover of the Ramones hit [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", a limited 12" [...] pink vinyl LP, a special slipmat, as well as various other merchandise packages. The album booklet and cover art was designed by artist and clothes designer Kyle Crawford. The brain logo was designed to symbolise the theme of the album, with Chad Gilbert explaining [...] "We talked about the brain and Radiosurgery. We talked about wanting an image <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> on a lot of things. We wanted to have that feeling, that look." ...|$|E

This approach considers Middle Palaeolithic humans as active agents, rather than passive recipients of optimised environmental conditions.|$|R
