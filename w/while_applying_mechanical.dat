40|$|Superior {{abilities}} of humans to dexterous manipulations depend on two main types of control mechanisms. First it is feedback control using signals from tactile mechanoreceptors enabling a task - specific "load-to-grip" sensorimotor transformation. Feedback control may provide precise control of parameters, but limitation in this control is long event-response delays. Thus, sensory based closed-loop feedback is ineffective at movement frequencies that regularly occur in manipulation. In fact, most manipulatory tasks require also feedforward control mechanisms. The parametric adjustment of fingertip forces to object properties gives {{strong evidence that}} the CNS uses internal models of the relevant physical properties of the objects that we interact with, in conjunction with sensorimotor memories. During manipulations, the internal models related to object properties are activated and updated by tactile sensors in the hand. Internal models retain the critical parameters of object and using previous experience predicts possible behavior of object during manipulation. In this light the main task of our study was to disclose the mechanisms of motor control programs and reveal the coding mechanisms in tactile afferents enabling dexterous manipulations in humans. Specifically we addressed question how the coordination of two digits is achieved when engaged in common restraint task. Further we investigated how the tactile receptors in fingertips encode such force parameters at contact site as direction of tangential force component. We used the technique of microneurography to record signals in human tactile afferents <b>while</b> <b>applying</b> <b>mechanical</b> stimuli to fingertips compatible to those that arise in everyday manipulative tasks. Microneurography is a method {{that allows us to}} record impulses in single nerve fibers in awake human subjects. It is based on percutaneously inserted tungsten microelectrodes that impale the relevant peripheral nerve. With this technique it is possible to analyze tactile neural mechanisms in man with a precision and resolution previously available only in experiments on anaesthetized animals, while at the same time, the subject can perform motor and psychophysical tasksSummary in Latvian, English, SwedishAvailable from Latvian Academic Library / LAL - Latvian Academic LibrarySIGLELVLatvi...|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{fabrication}} of bulk TiC 0. 7 /TiB 2 nanostructured composites through metastable transformation processing is investigated by taking advantages of two non-conventional powder metallurgy methods. First, the highly metastable TiC 0. 7 /TiB 2 agglomerated powders are synthesized by the so-called self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), followed by rapid quenching. Then, the spark plasma sintering (SPS) {{method is adopted}} to consolidate the SHSed powders. A bulk ceramic composite with nanocrystalline microstructure characterized by a high-relative density is then obtained. Dwell temperature of 1400 8 C, heating time of 3 min, and total processing time equal to 5 min, <b>while</b> <b>applying</b> a <b>mechanical</b> pressure of 20 MPa, {{are found to be}} the optimal SPS experimental conditions in order to obtain near-fully densified samples.

A very low-wear rate (Wv = 3. 8 106 mm 3 /(N m)) and a good thermal shock resistance (DTc = 250 8 C) are also displayed.

40|$|Wind is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising resources in the renewable energy portfolio. Still, to make wind energy conversion more economically viable, it is necessary to extract greater power from the wind while minimizing the cost associated with the technology. This is particularly important for small wind turbines, which have the highest cost per kilowatt of energy produced. One solution would be a variable ratio gearbox (VRG) that can be integrated into the simple and low-cost fixed-speed induction generator. Through discrete variable rotor speed operation, the VRG-enabled system affects the wind speed ratio, the power coefficient, and ultimately the power produced. To maximize electrical production, <b>mechanical</b> braking is <b>applied</b> during the normal operation of the wind turbine. A strategy is used to select gear ratios (GRs) that produce torque slightly above the maximum amount the generator can accept <b>while</b> simultaneously <b>applying</b> the <b>mechanical</b> brake, so that full load production may be realized over greater ranges of the wind speed. To characterize the performance of the system, a 100 kW, fixed speed, stall-regulated wind turbine, has been developed for this study. The VRG-enabled wind turbine control system is presented in two papers. Part 1 focuses on the turbine simulation model, which includes the rotor, VRG-enabled drivetrain, disk brake, and electric generator. A technique for estimating the performance of a disk brake, in the wind turbine context, is also presented. Part 2 of the research will present a dynamic optimization algorithm that is used to establish the control protocol for competing performance objectives. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4006882]...|$|R
