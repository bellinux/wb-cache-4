60|$|The {{day that}} preceded the night {{of which we are}} about to speak, was misty, with the wind fresh at east-south-east. The Rancocus was running off, south-west, and {{consequently}} was going with the <b>wind</b> <b>free.</b> Captain Crutchely had one failing, {{and it was a very}} bad one for a ship-master; he would drink rather too much grog, at his dinner. At all other times he might have been called a sober man; out, at dinner, he would gulp down three or four glasses of rum and water. In that day rum was much used in America, far more than brandy; and every dinner-table, that had the smallest pretension to be above that of the mere labouring man, had at least a bottle of one of these liquors on it. Wine was not commonly seen at the cabin-table; or, if seen, it was in those vessels that had recently been in the vine-growing countries, and on special occasions. Captain Crutchely was fond of the pleasures of the table in another sense. His eating was on a level with his drinking; and for pigs, and poultry, and vegetables that would keep at sea, his ship was always a little remarkable.|$|E
60|$|The isle lay nearly {{east and}} west, barring our advance on Fakarava. We must, therefore, hug the coast until we gained the western end, where, through a passage eight miles wide, we might sail southward between Raraka {{and the next}} isle, Kauehi. We had the <b>wind</b> <b>free,</b> a lightish air; but clouds of an inky {{blackness}} were beginning to arise, and at times it lightened--without thunder. Something, I know not what, continually set us up upon the island. We lay {{more and more to}} the nor'ard; and you would have thought the shore copied our manoeuvre and outsailed us. Once and twice Raraka headed us again--again, in the sea fashion, the quite innocent steersman was abused--and again the Casco kept away. Had I been called on, with no more light than that of our experience, to draw the configuration of that island, I should have shown a series of bow- window promontories, each overlapping the other to the nor'ard, and the trend of the land from the south-east to the north-west, and behold, on the chart it lay near east and west in a straight line.|$|E
60|$|The Dawn did {{her duty}} that day; {{and there was}} {{occasion}} for it, the frigate still continuing the chase. The circuit she had to make, and the berth she thought it prudent to give the first battery, enabled us to gain on her materially. When we passed the boat, the Englishman's upper sails were visible {{on the outside of}} the island, flying along the rocks at a rate that spoke well of his heels. He rounded the point when we were mid-sound, but here the battery served us a good turn, for, instead of hauling up close by the wind, the English were obliged to run off with the <b>wind</b> <b>free,</b> to keep out of harm's way. Their presence, notwithstanding, was probably of great service to the Dawn, for here had been a communication between Monsieur Le Gros and the battery, by means of a small boat sent from the latter, and we should have been very likely to have a messenger, in the shape of a shot, sent after us, when it was seen we continued to stand across for the main instead of tacking for the designated anchorage, had not the men in the battery had the higher game of the frigate in view. As soon as John Bull got within range, the gunners began to play on him, but it was at a distance that rendered their fire next to useless.|$|E

5000|$|Sailing ships {{continued}} to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s.

50|$|Under {{the action}} of steady <b>wind,</b> <b>free</b> snow {{particles}} accumulate and drift like the sand grains in barchan dunes, and the resulting drifting snow shapes are also popularly referred to as barchans. Inuit of Canada call them kalutoqaniq. When winds slacken, the drifted formations consolidate via sublimation and recrystallization. Subsequent winds erode kalutoqaniq into the sculptured forms of sastrugi. Inuit call large sculpturings kaioqlaq and small ripples tumarinyiq. Further erosion may turn kaioqlaq back into drifting kalutoqaniq. An intermediate stage of erosion is mapsuk, an overhanging shape. On the windward side of a ridge, the base erodes faster than the top, producing a shape like an anvil tip pointing upwind.|$|E

An application of our calibrations to a sample of ellipticals and a comparison with results derived from single stellar population models is given. Our models indicate that mean population ages span an interval of 7 - 12 Gyr and are correlated with metallicities, which range from approximately half up to three times solar.

40|$|Wind can induce noise on microphones, causing {{problems}} for users of hearing aids {{and for those}} making recordings outdoors. Perceptual tests in the laboratory and via the Internet were carried out to understand what features of wind noise {{are important to the}} perceived audio quality of speech recordings. The average A-weighted sound pressure level of the wind noise was found to dominate the perceived degradation of quality, while gustiness was mostly unimportant. Large degradations in quality were observed when the signal to noise ratio was lower than about 15 09 dB. A model to allow an estimation of wind noise level was developed using an ensemble of decision trees. The model was designed to work with a single microphone {{in the presence of a}} variety of foreground sounds. The model outputted four classes of wind noise: none, low, medium, and high. <b>Wind</b> <b>free</b> examples were accurately identified in 79 % of cases. For the three classes with noise present, on average 93 % of samples were correctly assigned. A second ensemble of decision trees was used to estimate the signal to noise ratio and thereby infer the perceived degradation caused by wind noise...|$|E
40|$|The Sun is at {{the centre}} {{of our solar system}} and it is {{constantly}} ejecting a flow of plasma outward into interplanetary space. This flow can take the form of two primary types; the fast solar wind; and the slow solar wind. The Sun may also eject plasma with more dynamic events which cause high density clouds of plasma to travel alongside the solar wind. In the modern world, a number of different techniques have been developed to study the solar wind from the Earth and also in interplanetary space. Interplanetary scintillation (IPS) is a technique that has been applied at Aberystwyth University to observe the continual density variations in the solar wind by observing a distant astronomical radio source and the scintillation of its radio waves as they pass through the solar wind. To perform this, a number of radio sites around the world have been used such as the European Incoherent SCATter radar (EISCAT) in northern Scandinavia, and the ever growing LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) based in the Netherlands. The IPS technique has also proved to be highly complementary with Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft which detect the white light which has been scattered by the solar wind particles. This thesis investigates the solar wind using a wide variety of techniques to observe the small- and large-scale structures which form in the solar wind. A study of IPS in 2007 and 2008 detected numerous events of rapid velocity variations which occurred in the slow solar wind. This showed evidence that the slow solar wind may have a ?blobular? nature formed of many small-scale transients as well as the large-scale transients which are already well known to us. In November 2011 LOFAR observed its first coronal mass ejection (CME) while observing IPS. This event proved to become of interest as it was successfully detected by a number of different techniques and could modeled and tracked accurately as it propagated outward to Earth?s orbit and even interacted with the Earth?s magnetosphere. A technique which could be applied to coronagraph observation separated the dynamic and quiescent solar wind structures from the images. The quiescent component became the basis {{for the development of a}} new solar wind model which could quickly and accurately map the background quiescent solar <b>wind</b> <b>free</b> from any of the complexities cause by CMEs...|$|E
