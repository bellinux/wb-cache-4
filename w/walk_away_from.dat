5|$|After {{the deal}} was announced, NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation, as no NBA {{franchise}} had moved since 1985, when the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California. He stated that his goal was that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there. The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team. The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on the issue. On 21 January 2001, Laurie {{announced that he had}} paid McCaw an undisclosed amount to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the deal.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

5|$|Kim's {{associates}} {{characterize the}} director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka recalls that Kim's way {{of writing a}} screenplay was to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen to neighborhood gossip, and write all night in the dark. South Korean film critic Lee Young-il remembers that Kim's shoes were never shined, {{and that one of}} his few material pleasures was high-quality coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry. The only official title he held within the film community was member of The National Academy of Arts, which he joined in 1997, and he did not cultivate friendships with journalists who could further his career.|$|E
5|$|They are {{alerted to}} {{eyewitness}} accounts {{of a woman}} who, after jumping with another man from a high roof and crashing onto a taxi parked below, simply walked away. As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity at Indianapolis.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{match was}} the main event from the SmackDown brand, a {{standard}} match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At {{the beginning of the}} match, Lesnar tried to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including DDT and Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon, who had accompanied Lesnar to the ring, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.|$|E
