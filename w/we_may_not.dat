25|$|Forage fish {{compensate}} for their small size by forming schools. These sometimes immense gatherings fuel the ocean food web. Most forage fish are pelagic fish, {{which means they}} form their schools in open water, {{and not on the}} bottom (benthic fish) or near the bottom (benthopelagic fish). They are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans, apart from an occasional support role in a documentary about a great ocean predator. While <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> pay them much attention, the great marine predators are keenly focused on them, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations that can span thousands of miles to connect with them. After all, forage fish are their food.|$|E

One of the major speeches he made on untouchability was at Nagpur in 1920, where he called untouchability as a great evil in Hindu society. In his remarks, he stated that the phenomena of untouchability is not unique to the Hindu society, but has deeper roots because Europeans in South Africa treat [...] "all of us, Hindus and Muslims, as untouchables; <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do". He called it intolerable. He stated this practice can be eradicated, Hinduism is flexible to allow this, and a concerted effort is needed to persuade it is wrong and by all to eradicate it.|$|E

The Alliance, which had been formed two months earlier, comprised 60 clergy from 10 denominations, [...] "the first racially integrated association of Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in Mississippi." [...] Nussbaum had helped found it, merging into it the Jackson Interfaith Fellowship. The Reverend Thomas Tiller, the Alliance president, stated that [...] "by default, we may have contributed to a climate of opinion which gives rise to terrorism.

There are going to be big plot lines that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up.

500|$|Coffin's first {{jobs were}} to design small flower gardens {{such as the}} {{suburban}} garden she designed for Edward Sprague in 1906 in Flushing, Queens. Noted for its original design, it was situated on a modest lot measuring 150 feet by 300 feet (45 m by 91 m), typical of the new suburban developments being built on Long Island at the time. A few years later, she wrote about the Sprague garden in Country Life in America and Elsa Rehmann also discussed it in her 1918 book The Small Place: Its Landscape Architecture. Coffin argued that a [...] "moderately well-to-do" [...] homeowner could create and maintain a substantial and elaborate garden for a modest expenditure, {{comparable to that of}} a mid-range car. She promoted the idea that even the most featureless lot could be beautified through good design: [...] "We certainly cannot create a magnificent view, but we can plan and plant beautiful screens and backgrounds that will be interesting at all seasons of the year. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> easily be able to construct a picturesque diversity at ground level, but we can plant so as to have much height and variety in our flower and shrub groups." ...|$|E

Berman originally described the episode as a press junket when talking about [...] at an event held by UPN for the Television Critics Association. He {{said it was a}} [...] "very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an 'Odd Couple' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun." [...] Bakula also explained {{in an interview with the}} website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will [...] "find out a lot of stuff about [...] that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!" [...] Billingsley said later that he enjoyed working with Bakula on this episode and called [...] "A Night in Sickbay" [...] one of his favourites.|$|E
500|$|No Saudi women's {{national}} football {{team will be}} competing at the 2012 London Olympics, despite extensive pressure from the International Olympic Committee. Still, in 2012, the national federation was quietly arguing with the International Football Association Board not to allow women's participation if they were wearing the hijab while playing. The logic they followed was that if FIFA allowed women to wear the hijab in recognised matches, {{it would be much}} more difficult for the federation to prevent a national team from being created. There is a lot of pressure being put on the sporting community to allow for national representation of women on the international team as the kingdom will likely be the last nation in the world to prohibit women from competing at the Olympics. If the Saudis can successfully argue the hijab cannot be worn in competition, it would make them less isolated internationally as other teams in the Arab world {{would be less likely to}} compete in the upcoming FIFA Women's Under-17 World Cup. PRI's The World said in late 2011: [...] "Who knows. In 10 years Saudi Arabia might just have a formidable national women's soccer team." [...] A current female football player in the country said of the situation as it pertains to the national team: [...] "Our generation started the game, the leagues, the structure.

500|$|Black {{nationalist}} {{poet and}} author Haki R. Madhubuti (Don L. Lee) agreed with Bennett's {{assessment of the}} film, stating that it was [...] "a limited, money-making, auto-biographical fantasy of the odyssey of one Melvin Van Peebles through what he {{considered to be the}} Black community." [...] The New York Times critic Clayton Riley viewed the film more favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he [...] "is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic colonialism." [...] In another review, Riley explained that [...] "Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> want him to exist but he does." [...] Critic Donald Bogle states in a New York Times interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, Sidney Poitier-type characters and that they wanted a [...] "viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero." [...] In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: [...] "Not since Oscar Micheaux had an African American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment... depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{fought in}} the wars against Denmark, Austria and France. Although he had opposed {{military}} action in each case, once war had started he supported the Prussian military wholeheartedly and took positions of command. Since he had no political influence at all, these were opportunities to prove himself. Frederick experienced his first combat in the Second Schleswig War. Appointed to supervise the supreme German Confederation commander Field Marshal Wrangel and his staff, the Crown Prince tactfully managed disputes between Wrangel and the other officers. The Prussians and their Austrian allies defeated the Danes and conquered {{the southern part of}} Jutland, but after the war they spent two years politicking to assume leadership of the German states. This culminated in the Austro-Prussian War. Frederick [...] "was {{the only member of the}} Prussian Crown Council to uphold the rights of the Duke of Augustenberg and oppose the idea of a war with Austria which he described as fratricide." [...] Although he supported unification and the restoration of the medieval empire, [...] "Fritz could not accept that war was the right way to unite Germany.". However, when war with Austria broke out, he accepted command of one of Prussia's three armies, with General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal as his chief of staff. The timely arrival of his II Army was crucial to the Prussian victory in 1866 at the decisive Battle of Königgrätz, which won the war for Prussia. After the battle, William presented Frederick with the Order Pour le Mérite for his personal gallantry on the field and leadership of the II Army. Nevertheless, the bloodshed caused him great dismay. A few days before Königgrätz, Frederick had written to his wife, expressing his hope that this would be the last war he would have to fight. On the third day of the battle he wrote to her again: [...] "Who knows whether <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have to wage a third war in order to keep what we have now won?" ...|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{maintains}} {{that she has}} never received any formal acting training. Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially thinks a character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I know that if I can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are we talking about what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict with her eyes and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s hard for me to imagine anyone who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E
