5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy.

5|$|According to Quintanilla, Jr., in January 1995 {{he began}} {{receiving}} telephone calls from fans <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> {{had paid for}} membership in the Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation. Quintanilla, Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques. Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette on the night of March 9 at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies concerning the disappeared funds. Quintanilla, Jr. told her that if she did not provide evidence that disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla, Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena. However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential {{to the success of the}} clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep her close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.|$|E
5|$|Although tape {{samplers}} {{had been}} explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The {{concept of the}} Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's directorial debut was The Legend of Boggy Creek, {{which was}} {{inspired}} by the Fouke Monster, a seven-foot-tall Bigfoot-like creature said to live in the swamps near Fouke, Arkansas. Pierce said he did not necessarily believe in the legend, but was fascinated with the stories. After interviewing Fouke residents <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> encountered the monster, Pierce became impressed with their authenticity and down-to-earth qualities. He approached Earl E. Smith, an acquaintance from the advertising business, to adapt those eyewitness tales into a screenplay. The film was shot at locations in Fouke, Texarkana and Shreveport, using a camera Pierce built himself at home. It was filmed in a faux documentary style, and included interviews with Fouke residents mixed with dramatizations of their supposed encounters with the creature. Like Pierce, the film's financial backers and many of the actors had never been involved in a film before.|$|E

A Baraita taught in accordance with the one <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> were mother and daughter, teaching that Jochebed was called Shiphrah because she straightened (meshapperet) the limbs of the newborns. Another explanation was that she was called Shiphrah because the Israelites were fruitful (sheparu) and multiplied in her days. Miriam was called Puah because she cried out (po'ah) to the unborn children to bring them out. Another explanation was that she was called Puah because she cried out (po'ah) with the Divine Spirit to say: [...] "My mother will bear a son who will save Israel." ...|$|R

40|$|Data from a {{five year}} {{follow up study}} on 4372 smokers and 3753 non-smokers were {{analysed}} to investigate {{the influence of the}} type of tobacco smoked and whether the subjects <b>said</b> <b>they</b> inhaled or not on the decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). The study sample comprised 1492 smokers of plain cigarettes and 1936 smokers of filter cigarettes, 1711 smokers of cheroots or cigars, and 233 male pipe smokers. Over the five years, smokers, especially those <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> inhaled, had a higher rate of decline of FEV 1 than non-smokers, in whom the average decline in FEV 1 was 25 ml/year for women and 30 ml/year for men. There {{was no significant difference in}} the decline in FEV 1 between filter cigarette smokers and plain cigarette smokers. The decline in FEV 1 in cigar or cheroot smokers was the highest for all the smoking groups, and associated with a very high tobacco consumption in this group. Among pipe smokers who inhaled, the decline in FEV 1 was slightly higher than in the cigarette smokers, whereas non-inhaling pipe smokers had a decline in FEV 1 that was similar to that of non-smokers. In general, the smokers <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> did not inhale had a smaller decline in FEV 1 than those <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> did. The effect of inhalation varied in magnitude in different smoking groups, being most pronounced in pipe smokers...|$|R
