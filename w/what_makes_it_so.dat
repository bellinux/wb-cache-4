25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
25|$|Proliferation resistance. In 2016, Nobel Laureate {{physicist}} Dr Carlo Rubbia, former Director General of CERN, {{claimed a}} {{primary reason for}} the United States cutting thorium reactor research in the 1970s is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> attractive today: thorium is difficult {{to turn into a}} nuclear weapon.The LFTR resists diversion of its fuel to nuclear weapons in four ways: first, the thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233, which then decays to uranium-233. If the protactinium remains in the reactor, small amounts of U-232 are also produced. U-232 has a decay chain product (thallium-208) that emits powerful, dangerous gamma rays. These are not a problem inside a reactor, but in a bomb, they complicate bomb manufacture, harm electronics and reveal the bomb's location. The second proliferation resistant feature {{comes from the fact that}} LFTRs produce very little plutonium, around 15kg per gigawatt-year of electricity (this is the output of a single large reactor over a year). This plutonium is also mostly Pu-238, which makes it unsuitable for fission bomb building, due to the high heat and spontaneous neutrons emitted. The third track, a LFTR doesn't make much spare fuel. It produces at most 9% more fuel than it burns each year, and it's even easier to design a reactor that makes only 1% more fuel. With this kind of reactor, building bombs quickly will take power plants out of operation, and this is an easy indication of national intentions. And finally, use of thorium can reduce and eventually eliminate the need to enrich uranium. Uranium enrichment is one of the two primary methods by which states have obtained bomb making materials.|$|E

One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that [...] "the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> powerful." ...|$|E

Daniel Jevons of Maximum approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long-range combat and the use of the mouse to move a crosshair rather than the entire viewpoint. However, he concluded that the game [...] "has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack, the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties, with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields". Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine praised the game's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality [...] "spectacular", but found its movement controls to be [...] "awkward". He concluded, [...] "Terra Nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic, fast-paced action with real-time squad-level tactics. It doesn't get much better than this".|$|E

Folk traditions in Moravia {{go back to}} the remote past and during its development Moravian folk music went through many changes. <b>What</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> unusual are primarily the preservation of numerous archaisms and enriching of tonal procedures by modal ones - by applying characteristic degrees of individual church modes. The interference of old and more recent elements and indefiniteness of keys are typical features of Moravian folk songs. The individuality of Moravian folk music also shows in its rhythmical side, which is characterized by frequent uneven figures, by distinctive phrasing, etc. The phrasing together with the direction of melodic line are the most impressive in its interpretation.

In this paper, the remote management of the generator done by a specific SMS with an authenticated mobile phone is elucidated. This system is extremely handy at places {{where we have to}} control the switching of the machine but no wired connection to that place is available. To implement this, a GSM modem is connected to a programmed microcontroller. Commands were used for controlling the functionality of GSM modem in both transmitter and receiver design, operating at 900 or 1800 MHZ band. The GSM technology also enables the user to know about the various parameters like temperature of the coolant, pressure of lubricant, fuel level, speed of the generator and to control the machine. This system is low cost, secure, ubiquitously accessible, remotely controlled solution for automation of power plant. The extensive capabilities of this system are <b>what</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> interesting...|$|R
500|$|The Persona {{series has}} been {{referred}} to as the most popular spin-off from the Megami Tensei franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. Io9's James Whitbrook commented that while [...] "here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane [...] "normal" [...] life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". Nintendo Power, in an article concerning the Megami Tensei series, cited the Persona series' [...] "modern-day horror stories" [...] and [...] "teams of Japanese high-school kids" [...] as the perfect example of the franchise. Persona was mentioned in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying [...] "Examining Persona reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. Persona 3 was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed Persona 3 and 4 in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list. Persona 3 was listed by Gamasutra as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. Persona 4 was also listed by Famitsu {{as one of the greatest}} games of all time in a 2010 list.|$|E
500|$|The {{animation}} in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut {{was created}} in 3D using Alias|Wavefront (now the Alias Systems Corporation) PowerAnimator software, running on Silicon Graphics O2 and Octane workstations. Characters and individual scene elements were designed with both texture mapping and shading that, when rendered, resemble 2D paper cut-out stop-motion animation. The artists at South Park Studios (at the time, called South Park Productions) used a multiprocessor SGI Origin 2000 and 31 multiprocessor Origin 200 servers (with 1.14 terabytes of storage) for both rendering and asset management. Backgrounds, characters and other items could be saved separately or as fully composited scenes, with speedy access later. [...] "By creating flat characters and backgrounds in a 3D environment, {{we are able to}} add textures and lighting effects that give the film a cut-out construction paper stop-motion style which would have taken many more months if done traditionally," [...] said Gina Shay, line producer of the film. The animation team, beginning with season five, began using Maya instead of PowerAnimator. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour. As the show's visual quality has substantially improved in recent seasons, the animation of South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut {{is a prime example of}} the show's old, cruder, even more primitive animation style. In the audio commentary on the 2009 Blu-ray reissue of the film, Stone and Parker take ample time to criticize how [...] "bad and time consuming" [...] the animation was during the era. IGN described the animation as [...] "fall somewhere within the middle ground—not quite cardboard cutouts, but not quite fully computerized either." [...] Nate Boss, in a review of the Blu-ray reissue for High-Def Digest, commented, [...] "There is no comparing the two, as the movie has a classic (for South Park, at least) animated feel, so full of the cut-outs we have grown to love, while the newer seasons sport a more computer processed feel." [...] The film, unlike the television series (at the time), was animated in widescreen (...) [...] [...] "Although the 'primitive' animation of South Park is supposedly a joke, it's really a secret weapon," [...] said [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.

2500|$|During January 1998 Robert Hanks of The Independent {{compared}} the series' ethos {{to that of}} Star Trek.

[...] Hanks concluded that [...] "Blake's 7 has acquired a credibility and popularity Terry Nation can never have expected...I think it's to do with the sheer crappiness of the series and the crappiness it attributes to the universe: it is science-fiction for the disillusioned and ironic – and that is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> very British." ...|$|E
