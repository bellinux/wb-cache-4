Zwei von den entworfenen Maschinen können, als direkt gekoppelte Windenergiegeneratoren genutzt werden. Die gebaute Prototypmaschine wurde als drehzahlvariabler langsamlaufender Generator unter verschiedenen Belastungsbedingungen geprüft. Gute Übereinstimmung zwischen den theoretisch vorausgesagten und experimentell erhaltenen Ergebnissen sind erreicht worden. Die hergestellte Prototypmaschine wurde als Einphasengenerator dimensioniert. Zwei Dreiphasige Entwürte sind theoretisch behandelt worden. Die typischen Merkmale dieser Maschinen sind der Stator mit seiner Ringwicklung sowie der Rotor mit den Permanentmagneten in der Anordung zur Flußkonzentration auf einem unmagnetischen Rotorkörper. Das Ergebnis dieser Entwurfsmethode ist ein recht hoher Wirkungsgrad mit 84, 6 % bei einer Leistung von etwa 1200 W. Die zwangsläufig auftretenden Rastmomente konnten durch den Einsatz von speziellen magnetischen Nutkeilen reduziert werden. Es erfolgte auch ein Berechnung der Rastmomente sowie der relevanten Parameter mittels der Finite Elemente Methode. This thesis {{presents}} design, optimization, {{construction and}} test of radial-flux low-speed rare-earth high-energy permanent-magnet (PM) electrical machines with new topology. Two of the designed machines {{can be used}} as directly driven wind energy generators. Due to absence of the field current and field winding, permanent magnet generators exhibit high efficiency in operation, simple and robust structure in construction and high power to weight ratio. The attractiveness of the permanent magnet generators is further enhanced by the availability of high-energy permanent magnet materials like NdFeB. Based on the equivalent magnetic circuit approach and permanent magnet load line characteristics, iterative preliminary design for the proposed generator was firstly carried out. The aim of this simple linear pre-design tool was to have an initial geometry for the detailed investigations of the finite element technique (FET) where the electromagnetic behavior of the machine was optimized. The stator of the machine was slotted. Slotted configuration was chosen as it permits lower effective air gap length and therefore thin magnets can be used. This, in fact, largely decreases the cost of active material as it is dominated by that of the magnets. However, cogging torque comes as a consequence of slots. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated using the flux-MMF technique enhanced by the FET. Cogging torque is an oscillatory torque caused by the variation of the co-energy of the permanent magnets with respect to the rotor position, resulting from the variation of the magnetic circuit seen by the magnets. It is an inherent characteristic of slotted permanent magnet machines. It should be studied and minimized in the applications where minimizing torque ripple, vibration and noise are essential requirements. The configuration of the rotor corresponding to the lowest cogging torque was adopted. The prototype machine was constructed using novel updated high-energy permanent magnets with a remanent of 1. 41 T. The stator laminations of the machine were cut using laser technology methods. The slots of the machine were flat and the windings were of toroidal type (torus) with short ends. This, in turn, reduced the cost and weight of active material and improved the efficiency. The permanent magnets were rectangular blocks of NdFeB with flux concentration arrangement and magnetized tangentially on the rotor support structure. Soft magnetic material is attached to both poles of the permanent magnets, which not only produced an easy path for the flux penetration but also reduced the leakage flux and therefore a typical ‘rule of thumb’ value for the leakage flux coefficient was achieved. The rotor support structure of the machine was manufactured from nonmagnetic light material (Aluminum). To further reduce the total weight of the machine, longitudinal holes were excavated inside the rotor support structure. The constructed prototype machine was tested as variable low-speed generator with different loading conditions. Good agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimentally obtained results has been achieved. The inertia of the system together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cogging</b> torque necessitated a peak starting torque of 64 % of the rated torque. To reduce this starting torque, the slot openings were filled up with bonded soft magnetic material with a relative permeability equals 10. The peak value of the starting torque has been reduced to 43 % of the rated torque. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated again and the performance of the slot-filled machine was studied and compared with the previous case. The manufactured prototype machine was single phase. Three-phase is also possible. The number of phases is usually determined based on the type of the load and the rated power demand. Finite element analysis and theoretical study were carried out on two three-phase machines of the same topology. The first one is a four-pole three-slot machine and the second one is ten-pole six-slot design...|$|E

This study aims to investigate the technical and economic consequences to use the coke oven gas (COG) to produce methanol (MeOH) to be used as automotive fuel. In a case study of a steel mill located in the northern Sweden, SSAB Tunnplåt AB in the town of Luleå, four different production processes have been studied. Two of them only use COG as a fuel, while the other two systems also use biomass based synthesis gas to blend <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>COG.</b> <b>The</b> results show that nearly 300 GWh of MeOH could be produced annually from COG only to a production cost in the range of € 0. 13 to € 0. 26 per litre MeOH.

Here, we present a rapid method of ortholog grouping which is effective enough to allow the comparison of many genomes simultaneously. The method takes as input all-against-all similarity data and classifies genes based on the traditional hierarchical clustering algorithm UPGMA. In the course of clustering, the method detects domain fusion or fission events, and splits clusters into domains if required. The subsequent procedure splits the resulting trees such that intra-species paralogous genes are divided into different groups so as to create plausible orthologous groups. As a result, the procedure can split genes into the domains minimally required for ortholog grouping. The procedure, named DomClust, was tested using <b>the</b> <b>COG</b> database as a reference.

Biochemical and cell biological analysis suggested that TMEM 115 has four candidate transmembrane domains located in the N-terminal region. Both the N- and C-terminal domains are oriented towards the cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence analysis supports that TMEM 115 is enriched in the Golgi cisternae. Functionally, TMEM 115 knockdown or overexpression delays Brefeldin-A-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport, phenocopying cells with mutations or silencing of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex.

We find that the major SCOP fold classes have different propensities to carry out certain broad categories of functions. For instance, alpha/beta folds are disproportionately associated with enzymes, especially transferases and hydrolases, and all-alpha and small folds with non-enzymes, while alpha+beta folds have an equal tendency either way. These observations for the database overall are largely true for specific genomes. We focus, in particular, on yeast, analyzing it with many classifications in addition to SCOP and EC (i. e. COGs, CATH, MIPS), and find clear tendencies for fold-function association, across a broad spectrum of functions. Analysis <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>COGs</b> scheme also suggests that the functions of the most ancient proteins are more evenly distributed among different structural classe...|$|R
50|$|Herringfleet Mill is an {{octagonal}} three-storey smock mill with a boat-shaped cap. Winding is by tailpole and winch, {{the last}} mill on the Broads. The four Common sails are {{carried on a}} cast-iron windshaft. The wooden brake sheel has 59 teeth. It drives a 4 ft cast-iron wallower <b>with</b> 47 <b>cogs.</b> <b>The</b> wallower is mounted on an 11+3/4 in square upright shaft. At {{the bottom of the}} upright shaft a cast-iron bevel gear with 33 teeth drives a cast-iron pit wheel <b>with</b> 102 <b>cogs.</b> <b>The</b> pit wheel is carried on a cast-iron shaft 8 in diameter. This shaft has at its outer end a 16 ft by 9 in scoopwheel. The mill could pump 2000 imp gal of water per minute.|$|R

The involvement of this complex in glycosylation and more specifically in Golgi glycosyltransferases localization has been highlighted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> discovery of <b>COG</b> subunit deficiencies leading to CDG (Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation), a group of inherited disorders of glycosylation. To date, many COG deficient CDG patients have been discovered and this article reviews the birth and rise of this group of defects.
