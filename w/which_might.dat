5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere.

5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (<b>which</b> <b>might</b> come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested <b>which</b> <b>might</b> {{be thought of as}} elves and <b>which</b> <b>might</b> partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr.
