40|$|One of {{the common}} methods to {{synchronize}} threads in multithreaded programs is using condition variables, where calling the <b>wait</b> <b>command</b> for a condition variable blocks the caller thread and calling a signal command over that condition variable unblocks all the blocked threads waiting for that condition variable. One potential problem with these programs is that a waiting thread is not signaled and is blocked forever. In this paper a verification approach for deadlock-freedom of such programs is presented. In this approach a correspondence is established between a condition variable and a ghost variable, such that its value when a condition variable is created and a <b>wait</b> <b>command</b> for that variable is called is non-negative and non-positive, respectively. Calling a <b>wait</b> <b>command</b> for a condition variable requires a credit for that variable, where a credit for that condition variable can be achieved when another thread increments the corresponding ghost variable and also signals that condition variable if the old value is zero. We are now developing a Coq formalization to formally prove soundness of the presented approach. nrpages: 15 status: publishe...|$|E

5000|$|In this example, each {{iteration}} of {{the loop}} requires the value written into a by the previous iteration. However, the entire statement is not dependent on the previous iteration, but {{only a portion of}} it. The statement is split into two blocks to illustrate this.The first statement has no loop carried dependence now, and the result of this statement is stored in the variable temp. The post (...) command is used to signal that the required result has been produced for utilization by other threads. The <b>wait</b> (i-2) <b>command</b> <b>waits</b> for the value ai-2 before unblocking. The execution time of DOACROSS parallelism largely depends on what fraction of the program suffers from loop-carried dependence.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the first version}} of a Wireless Sensor Network design and simulation tool, called CupCarbon. It is a multi-agent and discrete event Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) simulator. Networks can be designed and prototyped in an ergonomic user-friendly interface using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) framework by deploying sensors directly on the map. It can be used to study the behaviour of a network and its costs. The main objectives of CupCarbon are both educational and scientific. It can help trainers to explain the basic concepts and how sensor networks work and it can help scientists to test their wireless topologies, protocols, etc. The current version can be used to study the power diagram of each sensor and the overall network and also to simulate "destructive" insect movements. The sensor programming is done individually in each sensor as it must have its own communication program. In this version, only sending or <b>waiting</b> <b>commands,</b> and mobility on the OSM map are implemented so far. The power diagrams can be calculated and displayed {{as a function of the}} simulated time. Prototyping networks is more realistic compared to existing simulators...|$|R
