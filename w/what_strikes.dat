This would make sense, since a large Scandinavian tribe named the Suiones was known to the Romans.|$|E
500|$|Although Hazlitt {{had seen}} As You Like It on stage, he remembered it most fondly from having read it so {{frequently}} that he practically had it memorised. In Characters of Shakespear's Plays, {{he makes no}} mention at all of any stage performances, treating the play as one primarily meant to be read. <b>What</b> <b>strikes</b> him as most notable about it is its character of a [...] "pastoral drama", one that presents an [...] "ideal" [...] world—that is, a world of thought and imagination, not action. And {{though it is a}} comedy, its interest derives not so much from in our being made to laugh at any particular human follies, but rather, [...] "more out of the sentiments and characters than out of the actions or situations. It is not what is done, but what is said, that claims our attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Strength of mind, {{by which}} Wollstonecraft meant [...] "the {{degree to which}} [...] can {{independently}} reach its own conclusions" [...] (emphasis in original), is central to her idea of the female genius. Merely imitating others is not enough, even if one imitates the [...] "correct" [...] actions and thoughts. Reason, for Wollstonecraft, is what controls the emotions; without reason, she contends, people would fail to understand their own feelings. Moreover, reason allows for the distinction between a useful sensibility and a harmful sensualism. She writes: [...] "sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these raptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by <b>what</b> <b>strikes</b> his gross senses." [...] Useful sensibility allows Mary to embark upon charity projects. Yet, this highly attuned sensibility separates the classes along emotional lines: only the middle-class Mary is able {{to understand what the}} poor around her require.|$|E
5000|$|The adapted {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Alan Sharp, with clearance from the Dunsany Literary Estate. Trevor Johnston has written, [...] "If you read the original story before seeing the film ..., then see the film, <b>what’s</b> <b>striking</b> is that Sharp has not so much effected an adaptation as a reinvention." ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>strikes</b> the listener, {{beyond any}} dissimilarity {{between the various}} numbers in the score, is the {{essentially}} unified character of the musical invention: an atmosphere of warm, joyous freshness breathes from every single page of the opera, reaching {{as far as the}} arias for minor characters and even the march in the third act. It offers an interpretation of the text which is completely in harmony with Metastasio's poetry and the exaltation of youth and love particular to this drama. The [...] "pathetic" [...] moments are short and few in number in an opera which resolves even the most emotionally lacerating situations with a grace which perfectly captures the expressive medium of the poet's verse, treated with extraordinary sensitivity in the declamation.|$|E
2500|$|Longhi wrote: [...] "Who {{could think}} {{in fact that}} over a sheet so candid, a so brutal and terrible {{massacre}} could happen [...] but—it's natural to say—this is a terrible woman! A woman painted all this?... there's nothing sadistic here, instead <b>what</b> <b>strikes</b> the most is the impassibility of the painter, who was even able to notice how the blood, spurting with violence, can decorate with two drops the central spurt! Incredible I tell you! And also please give Mrs. Schiattesi—the conjugal name of Artemisia—the chance to choose the hilt of the sword! At last don't {{you think that the}} only aim of Giuditta is to move away to avoid the blood which could stain her dress? We think anyway that that is a dress of Casa Gentileschi, the finest wardrobe in the Europe during 1600, after Van Dyck." ...|$|E
2500|$|The author makes a {{point of}} {{grounding}} his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward, not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; [...] "If you look at The Lord of the Rings, <b>what</b> <b>strikes</b> you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series." [...] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner, he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.|$|E
5000|$|On June 1, 2012, about 100 or half of Palermo’s workers went {{on strike}} to protest the firing of nearly all 89 {{immigrant}} workers lacking necessary documentation in <b>what</b> <b>striking</b> workers claim to be retaliation for signing a petition to form a union, {{as well as what}} they said were poor wages and working conditions.

5000|$|<b>What's</b> <b>striking</b> about Knox's work is {{that she}} seems willing to say almost anything, which sounds like it could be self-indulgent but which in her hands turns into a powerful, {{idiosyncratic}} account of American culture. [...] She has described her reader as [...] "a man, dressed like a woman, is over 40 but wider than a mile, 9 feet tall, all that, is a Camaro owner ... happily answers all telephone surveys" ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{took five}} years of {{research}} and covers 225 buildings from {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, presenting photographs along with commentary. [...] As the New York Times observes, <b>what's</b> <b>striking</b> is the diversity of religious structures in New Jersey, a state that [...] "was always more religiously diverse than New England." [...] And yet, the Times continues, the book still provides us with the sense of a [...] "typical New Jersey church." ...|$|R

5000|$|Television critic James Poniewozik has {{disagreed}} with this assessment, writing, [...] "for {{all the talk}} about 'humiliation TV,' <b>what's</b> <b>striking</b> about most reality shows is how good humored and resilient most of the participants are: the American Idol rejectees stubbornly convinced of their own talent, the Fear Factor players walking away from vats of insects like Olympic champions. What finally bothers their detractors is, perhaps, not that these people are humiliated but that they are not." ...|$|R
30|$|The last stage, Level 4, {{describes}} a full decentralization of all components, meaning that data and applications are being stored and run separately. This concept {{can be found}} in the field of “Internet of Things” [7] and in the “Fog Computing-Paradigma” [10]. Currently, the implementation of this stage is subject to recent research. <b>What’s</b> <b>striking</b> is that only the whole ecosystem needs to be trusted but not the centralized provider.

6000|$|For <b>what</b> <b>strikes</b> the Psalmist is, again, {{exactly what}} would strike a modern poet, or a modern man of science: the {{strength}} and ease of the vast beast; its enjoyment of its own life and power.

6000|$|... "Clergymen {{wonder why}} Christianity doesn't make more {{progress}} to-day; well, <b>what</b> <b>strikes</b> the impartial observer who {{thinks about the}} subject at all, as one reason, is the paralyzing inconsistency of an alliance between those who preach the brotherhood of man {{and those who are}} opposed to it. I've often wondered what clergymen would say about it, if they were frank--only I never see any clergymen." ...|$|E

30|$|<b>What</b> is <b>striking</b> {{about these}} {{examples}} {{is not necessarily}} the fact that activities related to different informatic components interact; that has to some degree perhaps always been the case. <b>What</b> is <b>striking</b> {{is the degree to which}} they do so automatically, as conditioned by digital media, and within the purview of the actor driving the technological and informatic innovation. This is almost never national authorities, due to capacity issues described above. To the extent that reliance on technology and the introduction of novel actors drive informatic discretion beyond the influence of national authorities, this phenomenon is likely to be exacerbated by instances of technological and operational convergence.|$|R

The women strike me as being singularly delicate and pretty; well dressed, too, I might add; but, while there is a great air of decency, there is very little high finish; and <b>what</b> <b>strikes</b> me as being quite odd, under such circumstances, scarcely any downright vulgarity, or coarseness." ...|$|E

5000|$|The AllMusic {{reviewer}} James Manheim commented: [...] "It's {{not easy}} in this eclectic age to juxtapose musical items {{that have never}} been in proximity before, but Canada's Gryphon Trio and soprano Patricia O'Callaghan manage to do so on this recording, which proclaims itself unlike any previous chamber music album … <b>What's</b> <b>striking</b> is how well the combination of rock-era English-language music and Latin song works." [...] The WholeNote reviewer Dianne Wells described the arrangements on the album as [...] "brilliant", the Gryphon Trio's playing as [...] "superb and complex", and O'Callaghan's singing as [...] "gorgeous" [...] and her [...] "expert facility with languages … remarkable".|$|R
