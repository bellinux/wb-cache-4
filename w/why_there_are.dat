5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E

25|$|Although coram nobis is {{not usually}} {{available}} to a convict who is still serving a prison sentence, the alternative remedy of habeas corpus may be available in that case.

25|$|In {{order to}} better provide stark, contrasting, analogies, the Futurist {{literature}} promoted a kind of hyper-conciseness. It was dubbed essential and synthetic lyricism. The former refers to a paring down of any and all superfluous objects while the latter expresses an unnatural compactness of the language unseen elsewhere. This idea explains where poetry became the preferred literary medium of Futurism and <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no Futurist novels (since novels are neither pared down nor compressed).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Formal testing with linear {{temporal}} logic (LTL) reduces to a matching problem. Most existing matching methods only provide yes/no answers. Such answers are unsatisfactory and not helpful to precisely {{track down the}} source of a matching failure. We introduce a constructive method for finitely executed temporal properties. Our method provides detailed explanations (a) <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a match, (b) <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no match, or (c) <b>why</b> <b>there</b> could possibly <b>be</b> a match. The approach has been fully implemented and is applied in some real-world projects for testing of synchronously executed software components. ...|$|R

25|$|Ethical vegetarians {{say that}} the reasons for not hurting or killing animals {{are similar to the}} reasons for not hurting or killing humans. They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be {{justified}} in extreme circumstances; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious of their behavior and have a choice; this is <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards.|$|E
25|$|By the Song dynasty (960–1279), the {{selective}} domestic breeding of goldfish was firmly established. In 1162, the empress of the Song Dynasty ordered {{the construction of}} a pond to collect the red and gold variety. By this time, people outside the imperial family were forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold (yellow) variety, yellow being the imperial colour. This is probably the reason <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though the latter are genetically easier to breed. The occurrence of other colours (apart from red and gold) was first recorded in 1276.|$|E

25|$|This is also <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> nine {{forms of}} the dragon and there are 9 sons of the dragon (see Classical depictions above). The Nine-Dragon Wall is a spirit wall with images of nine {{different}} dragons, and is found in imperial Chinese palaces and gardens. Because nine was considered {{the number of the}} emperor, only the most senior officials were allowed to wear nine dragons on their robes—and then only with the robe completely covered with surcoats. Lower-ranking officials had eight or five dragons on their robes, again covered with surcoats; even the emperor himself wore his dragon robe with one of its nine dragons hidden from view.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} brane physics {{have been applied}} to {{cosmology}}. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is {{the largest number of}} spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.|$|E
25|$|The Talmud Bavli gives {{two reasons}} <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three basic prayers de-rabbanan ("from our Rabbis") since the early Second Temple period on: to recall the daily sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem, and/or because each of the Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the {{afternoon}} and Jacob the evening prayer. The Talmud yerushalmi states that the Anshei Knesset HaGedola ("The Men of the Great Assembly") learned and understood the beneficial concept of regular daily prayer from personal habits of the forefathers (avoth, Avraham, Isaac, Yaacov) as hinted in the Tanach, and instituted the three daily prayers. A distinction is made between individual prayer and communal prayer, which requires a quorum known as a minyan, with communal prayer being preferable as it permits the inclusion of prayers that otherwise would be omitted.|$|E

She also published a series of readers to help Ghanaian children learn English: The Lost Earring, Yao and the Python, Abena and the Python, Afua and the Mouse and Kofi and the Crow, as well as a series of novels for children and adults, including Gift of the Mmoatia and Ring of Gold, and two volumes of poetry. Some of her works are used as set texts in primary and secondary schools in West Africa. Perhaps, her most important publication, however, which was the result of nearly five decades of work, was Bu Me Bé: Proverbs of the Akan, a collection of more than 7,000 Twi proverbs that was launched in Accra in 2001.|$|E
