This reaction shows product selectivity depending on the coligand and the metal centre. With [Ni(COD) _ 2] as metal(0) -precursor and sterically demanding phosphines as coligands the reaction results in the formation of nickelacyclic #eta#" 3 -allyl-carboxylates, where the carboxyl-group coordinates monodentate after migration of the acidic proton to the beta-carbon of the acid.

The nickel-mediated {{coupling}} of asymmetric alkynes {{with carbon}} dioxide {{is known to be}} highly regioselective with respect to the formation of nickelacycle intermediates and α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid products. Using density functional theory (DFT), we have investigated the effect that parameters such as acetylene-substituent, ancillary ligand and solvent have on the potential energy surface of the nickelacycle coupling reaction. 3 -R-substituted nickelacycles are the thermodynamically preferred product in all cases surveyed, however, the transition structure characterised by the attack of CO 2 on the alkyne carbon distal from the R-group is generally lower in energy, making the 2 -R-substituted nickelacycle the kinetically favoured product.

Two distinct transition states have been located on the potential energy surface between the eta 2 -coordinated arene and the oxidative addition product. The first, at relatively low energy, features an eta 3 -coordinated arene and connects two identical eta 2 -arene minima, while the second leads to cleavage of the C-X bond. The absence of intermediate C-F or C-H sigma complexes observed in other systems is traced {{to the ability of}} the 14 -electron metal fragment to accommodate the eta 3 -coordination mode in the first transition state. Oxidative addition of the C-F bond is exothermic at both nickel and platinum, but the barrier is significantly higher for the heavier element as a result of strong 5 dpi-ppi repulsions in the transition state. Similar repulsive interactions lead to a relatively long Pt-F bond with a lower stretching frequency in the oxidative addition product. Activation of the C-H bond is, in contrast, exothermic only for the platinum complex. We conclude that the nickel system is better suited to selective C-F bond activation than its platinum analogue for two reasons: the strong thermodynamic preference for C-F over C-H bond activation and the relatively low kinetic barrier...|$|R

50|$|TCP {{does not}} {{contaminate}} soil. Instead, it leaks down into groundwater and settles {{at the bottom}} of the reservoir because TCP is more dense than water. This makes TCP in its pure form a DNAPL (Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquid) and it is, therefore, harder to remove it from groundwater. There is no evidence that TCP can naturally decompose, but it might in favorable conditions. Groundwater remediation of TCP can occur through in situ chemical oxidation, permeable reactive barriers, and other remediation techniques. Several TCP remediation strategies have been studied and/or applied with varying degrees of success. These include extraction with granular activated carbon, in situ chemical oxidation, and in situ chemical reduction.

The pseudotetrahedral, divalent halide complexes [PhBP_ 3]NiCl (1), [PhBP_ 3]NiI (2), and [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]NiCl (3) were prepared by the metalation of [PhBP_ 3]Tl or [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Tl with (Ph_ 3 P) _ 2 NiCl_ 2, NiI_ 2, and (DME) NiCl_ 2 (DME = 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane), respectively.

Complexes 2 − 5 and 7 have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and are pseudotetrahedral monomers in the solid state. Complex 1 reacts readily with oxygen to form the four-electron-oxidation product, {[PhB(CH_ 2 P(O) Ph_ 2) _ 2 (CH_ 2 PPh_ 2) ]NiCl} (8 A or 8 B), which features a solid-state structure that is dependent on its method of crystallization. Chemical reduction of 1 using Na/Hg or other potential 1 -electron reductants generates a product that arises from partial ligand degradation, [PhBP_ 3]Ni(η^ 2 -CH_ 2 PPh_ 2) (9).

The reactivity of these [PhBP_ 3]Ni^IL and [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]NiI^L complexes with respect to oxidative group transfer reactions from organic azides and diazoalkanes is discussed. The zerovalent nitrosyl complex [PhBP_ 3]Ni(NO) (16) is prepared by the reaction of 1 with excess NO or by treating 12 with stoichiometric NO.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{coordination}} {{behavior of}} disilylated stannylenes toward zerovalent group 10 transition metal complexes was studied. This {{was accomplished by}} reactions of PEt 3 adducts of disilylated stannylenes <b>with</b> <b>zerovalent</b> group 10 transition metal complexes. The thus obtained products differed between the first row example nickel and its heavier congeners. While with nickel stannylene complex formation was observed, coordination of the stannylenes to palladium and platinum compounds led to unusual silastan-nene complexes of these metals. A computational model study indicated that in each case metal stannylene complexes were formed first and that the disilylstannylene/silastannene rearrangement occurs only after complexation to the group 10 metal. The isomerization is a two-step process with relatively small barriers, suggesting a thermodynamic control of product formation. In addition, {{the results of the}} computational investigation revealed a subtle balance of steric and electronic effects, which determines the relative stability of the metalastannylene complex relative to its silastannene isomer.

They are sources of contamination for soil, groundwater and surface water, and may pose a risk {{to the environment and}} human health. The investigated shooting range at Steinsjøen (Hurdal, Norway) has surface and porewater concentrations exceeding EU drinking water limits and Norwegian environmental quality standards. Chemical stabilization with iron-based soil amendments has shown to be a promising method for sustainable remediation. A test field was set up at a shooting range bullet trap at Steinsjøen. The aim was to investigate the long-term retention effects of two different iron-based amendments. Different sections with reference soil (no amendments), soil with CFH- 12 &limestone (ferric oxyhydroxides and limestone for pH regulation), and soil <b>with</b> <b>zerovalent</b> iron (Fe) were established. Some sections contained 2 %, some 4 % amendments mixed in, and some contained amendments as top application (2 %). Porewater samples were taken from July 2010 to October 2013 and analyzed. In addition, surface water was sampled in 2013. Examination of reference soil porewater indicated a constantly high weathering rate of spent bullets with high concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb and Sb. The results showed that pH and DOC levels play important roles in element mobilization. Both amendment types showed good retention for Pb (> 94 %) in all soils with mixed in application. Antimony (59 - 74 %), Cu (64 - 70 %) and Zn (60 - 73 %) retention in soil mixed with 2 % CFH- 12 &limestone was lower than for Pb. The same was valid for Sb (~ 73 %) and Cu (46 - 94 %) in soil mixed <b>with</b> <b>zerovalent</b> Fe. Zinc retention was very low in the zerovalent Fe amended soil, even negative (- 26 - 26 %), probably due to a lower pH than in soil with added limestone and small Zn concentrations in the amendment itself. When adding 4 % amendment, a retention improvement was only found for Sb (> 85 %). Top application did not show good results for any of the elements due to no downward movement of sorbents and had negative effects on cation retention in CFH- 12 &limestone treated soil probably due to ion exchange reactions with calcium (Ca). Geochemical modeling with Visual MINTEQ showed that approximately ~ 20 % Pb was bound to fulvic acids containing phenolate (FA 2) and ~ 70 % of the Cu to fulvic acids containing carboxylate (FA 1) in the reference soil. 100 % of Pb and Cu in porewater from CFH- 12 &limestone treated soil formed complexes with fulvic acids, most (> 90 %) of which was FA 2. This change in Cu speciation is probably due to increased pH. Zinc occurred primarily as freely dissolved Zn 2 + and Sb aspentavalent Sb(OH) 6 -.

The removal kinetics of aqueous Cr(VI) and As(V) were studied in batch experiments for initial concentrations ranging from 100 to 10, 000 μg/L. Removal kinetics were also studied in columns packed <b>with</b> <b>zerovalent</b> iron filings over this same concentration range. Electrochemical analyses {{were used to}} investigate the electron transfer reactions occurring on the iron surface, and {{to determine the effect}} of chromate and arsenate on the iron corrosion behavior. The removal mechanism for chromate involved reduction to Cr(III) and the formation of hydroxide precipitates. Increasing chromate concentrations resulted in decreasing removal rates due to iron surface passivation. Even at low concentrations, chromate acts as a corrosion inhibitor and decreases iron corrosion rates. The condition of the iron surface prior to exposure to chromate determined the chromium removal kinetics. Air-formed oxides significantly inhibited chromate removal, whereas oxides formed in anaerobic, chromate-free water resulted in higher removal rates. Although direct reduction of chromate at cathodic sites on the iron surface was observed at early elapsed times, chromate removal eventually became limited by the rate at which Fe²⁺ could be generated at anodic sites. The removal mechanism for arsenate did not involve reduction and was due to the formation of inner-sphere, bidentate complexes with iron corrosion products. At low arsenate concentrations the rate of arsenate removal was limited by diffusion to adsorption sites. At high concentrations the rate of arsenate removal was limited by the rate of adsorption site generation resulting from iron corrosion. Adsorbed arsenate blocked electroactive sites on the iron surface and decreased iron corrosion rates. Arsenate is expected to remain as the principal adsorbed species in iron filter media because electrochemical reduction of As(V) to As(III) is not favorable under the conditions relevant to freely corroding iron...|$|R

Comparison of iron corrosion rates with those for TCE reaction showed that TCE reduction occurred almost exclusively via atomic hydrogen at low pH values and via atomic hydrogen and direct electron transfer at neutral pH values. In contrast, reduction of PCE occurred primarily via direct electron transfer at both low and neutral pH values. The EIS data showed that all the rate limitations for TCE and PCE dechlorination occurred during {{the transfer of the}} first two electrons. Carbon tetrachloride (CT) reductive dechlorination was studied at a nickel rotating disk electrode using chronoampermetry (CA) and EIS. Only trace levels of methylene chloride and chloromethane were produced, indicating that sequential hydrogenolysis was not the predominant pathway for methane production. EIS showed that the ratelimiting step for CT reduction was the transfer of the first electron to a physically adsorbed CT molecule. The feasibility of an electrochemical reductive dechlorination method for removing CT from potable water was carried out in a flow-through reactor using bare and polymer coated porous nickel electrodes. Destruction of half-life values for CT with the bare nickel electrode ranged from 3. 5 to 5. 8 minutes for electrode potentials ranging from - 652 to - 852 mV with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

Two new benzyne precursors are described; the sodium and lithium salts of 1 -(toluene-p-sulphonamido) benzotriazole (Ia, Ib), and (1 -benzotriazolyl) iminotriphenylphosphorane (II) give benzyne on photolysis. For comparison the new cyclohexyne and cycloheptyne precursors, (4, 5 -tetramethylene-l-triazolyl) iminotriphenylphosphorane (III) and (4, 5 -pentamethylene-l-triazolyl) iminotriphenylphosphorane (IV) were prepared. It was also found that photolysis at room temperature of cycloheptenocyclopropenone (V) gave cycloheptyne. 1, 2, 3 -Benzothiadiazole- 1, 1 -dioxides(VI) and benzene- diazonium- 2 -csrboxylates (VII) were used as benzyne precursors with tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) platinum(O) (VIII) to prepare benzyne-platinum complexes. Benzyne-platinum intermediates are postulated with 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole- 1, 1 -dioxides in refluxing ether - benzene where cyclotrimerisation of benzyne to triphenylenes (not observed {{in the absence of}} platinum) occurs. In cold benzene, 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole- 1, 1 -dioxide is trapped by tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) platinum(O) before it decomposes to benzyne to give the adduct (IX), which when irradiated, is also a new benzyne precursor. The reaction with benzenediazonium - 2 -carboxylates gives carboxylato-platinum complexes (X) which are not benzyne precursors and no cyclotrimerisation of benzyne was detected. The oxidation of l-aminobenzotriazole (XI) in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) platinum(O) did not lead to a benzyne-platinum complex and benzyne-platinum intermediates {{do not appear to be}} involved. Furthermore the above, new, non-oxidative routes to benzyne with tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) platinum(O) gave no {{evidence for}} benzyne-platinum complexes.

The lead tetraacetate oxidation of 1 -aminobenzotriazole in the presence of ethylenebis(triphenylphosphine) platinum (XIII) does, however, appear to give a benzyne-platinum complex which is stable for 10 minutes in solution. Benzyne was again cyclotrimerised to triphenylene in this reaction.

40|$|The high {{susceptibility}} of chlorinated {{aliphatic hydrocarbons}} (CAHs) like 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (1, 1, 1 -TCA) {{to be transformed}} via different competing pathways (biotic and abiotic) complicates the assessment of their fate in groundwater. This knowledge is necessary to evaluate contaminant degradation and potential formation of toxic intermediates. Identifying pathways is further complicated in sites contaminated by mixed CAHs because some degradation products of 1, 1, 1 -TCA can be formed from different precursors. Here, identification of pathways based solely on substrate-product concentration relationships may lead to ambiguous interpretations. This study investigates, for the first time, dual C−Cl isotope fractionation {{as a means of}} identifying and assessing degradation pathways of 1, 1, 1 -TCA in groundwater. Distinctly different dual isotope trends (L = Δδ 13 C/Δδ 37 Cl) were observed for 1, 1, 1 -TCA transformation via oxidation with heat-activated persulfate (L = ∞), reduction <b>with</b> <b>zerovalent</b> iron (L = 1. 5 ± 0. 1), hydrolysis and dehydrohalogenation (HY/DH, L = 0. 33 ± 0. 04) in laboratory experiments, illustrating the potential of a dual isotope approach. This approach was evaluated in an aerobic aquifer impacted by 1, 1, 1 -TCA and trichloroethylene (TCE) with concentrations of up to 20 mg/L and 3. 4 mg/L, respectively. For 1, 1, 1 -TCA, the dual isotope slope determined from field samples (L = 0. 6 ± 0. 2, r 2 = 0. 75) was close to the slope observed for HY/DH in the laboratory (L = 0. 33 ± 0. 04), indicating that HY/DH was the predominant degradation pathway of 1, 1, 1 -TCA in the aquifer. The observed deviation could be explained by a minor contribution of additional degradation processes. This result, along with the little degradation of TCE determined from isotope measurements, confirmed that 1, 1, 1 -TCA was the main source of the 1, 1 -dichlorethylene (1, 1 -DCE) detected in the aquifer with concentrations of up to 10 mg/L. This study demonstrates that a dual C-Cl isotope approach can strongly improve the qualitative and quantitative assessment of 1, 1, 1 -TCA degradation processes in the field...|$|R
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the chemistry of molecular precursors is useful in achieving more predictable and reproducible nanocrystal preparations. Recently, an efficient approach was introduced that consists of fine-tuning the chemical reactivity of the synthetic molecular precursors used, while keeping all other reaction conditions constant. Using nickel phosphides as a research platform, we have studied how the chemical structure and reactivity of a family of commercially available organophosphite precursors (P(OR) 3, R = alkyl or aryl) alter the preparation of metallic and metal phosphide nanocrystals. Organophosphites are a versatile addition to the pnictide synthetic toolbox, nicely complementing other available precursors such as elemental phosphorus or trioctylphosphine (TOP). Experimental and computational data show that different organophosphite precursors selectively yield Ni, Ni 12 P 5, and Ni 2 P and that these phases evolve over time through separate mechanistic pathways. Based on our observations, we propose that nickel phosphide formation requires organophosphite coordination to a nickel precursor, followed by intramolecular rearrangement. We also propose that metallic nickel formation involves outer sphere reduction by uncoordinated organophosphite. These two independent pathways are supported by the fact that preformed Ni nanocrystals do not react {{with some of the most}} reactive phosphide-forming organophosphites, failing to evolve into nickel phosphide nanocrystals. Overall, the rate at which organophosphites react with nickel(II) chloride or acetate to form nickel phosphides increases in the order P(OMe) 3 3 ̆c P(OEt) 3 3 ̆c P(OnBu) 3 3 ̆c P(OCH 2 tBu) 3 3 ̆c P(OiPr) 3 3 ̆c P(OPh) 3. Some organophosphites, such as P(OMe) 3 or P(OiPr) 3, transiently form <b>zerovalent,</b> metallic <b>nickel,</b> while this is the only persistent product observed with the bulky organophosphite P(O- 2, 4 -tBu 2 C 6 H 4) 3. We expect that these results will alleviate the need for time-consuming testing and random optimization of several different reaction conditions, thus enabling a faster development of these and similar pnictide nanomaterials for practical applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work two nanoparticle-enzyme (NP-enzyme) systems were designed: one for medical and one for {{industrial}} applications. The first is the NP-DAAO system that, developed for cancer therapy purpose, combines the magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles (γ-Fe 2 O 3 NPs) with those of the H 2 O 2 generating enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) in order to target the system near to the cancer and once there, to induce a local toxicity able to kill the surrounding tumor cells. The second NP-enzyme system is the NP-LASPO and finds application in the industrial field. This NP-system, composed by magnetic Fe 3 O 4 NPs conjugated to L-aspartate oxidase (LASPO), allows the resolution of a racemic mixture of D, L-aspartate offering many advantages such as the possibility to recover and reuse the system once the reaction in the bioreactor is over but also to obtain pure end-products without the enzyme contamination.

Control soil samples and soil fortified with nZVI particles or CaO were treated at 200 and 250 °C in sealed glass ampoules. Treatment of the ampouled samples at 250 °C was more effective than treatment at 200 °C and the reduction in PCDD/F concentration was greatest when soil was treated at 250 °C with nZVI addition (indeed, treatment at 200 °C {{in the absence of}} nZVI resulted in increases in total PCDD and PCDD/F concentrations). In larger-scale experiments based on the obtained results, using a rotary furnace, the greatest reduction in total PCDD/F concentration was achieved by treating soil at 280 °C, and adding nZVI to the soil resulted in almost no detectable PCDD/F in the gas phase.

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI-MS/MS) {{was used to}} probe the binding of silver ions and reduced silver species with polyamidoamine generation 1 amine-terminated (PAMAMG 1 NH 2) and generation 2 hydroxyl-terminated (PAMAMG 2 OH) dendrimers. At Ag+/PAMAMG 2 OH molar ratios of ≤ 1, 1 : 1 complexes are observed, while at ratios > 1, 2 : 1 and low abundance 3 : 1 complexes emerge. Similar results were observed for PAMAMG 1 NH 2. The collisional activated dissociation (CAD) patterns of the dendrimer ions are characterized by losses of amidoamine branches resulting largely from hydrogen migration and cleavage reactions. Ag+/dendrimer complexes are characterized {{by the loss of}} a dendrimer branch from the complex, with the silver ion remaining bound to a dendrimer fragment. When the Ag+-bound dendrimer complexes are reduced by hydrazine, low abundance complexes, whose m/z values are consistent <b>with</b> ones containing <b>zerovalent</b> silver species, are observed in the mass spectra. Complexes with three silver atoms are observed in the spectrum containing PAMAMG 1 NH 2, and complexes with four and five silver atoms are observed with PAMAMG 2 OH. The CAD fragmentation patterns of the complexes formed after the silver reduction are different than those observed for complexes containing one silver ion and are characterized by the ejection of all silver species, possibly as a cluster, leaving the intact dendrimer ion. Experiments with Cu+, Cu 2 +, and Pt 2 + binding to PAMAMG 2 OH were also done, but reduced metal clusters were not observed in the mass spectra after the addition of hydrazine...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of chemical stabilization technique on arsenic (As) contaminated soil amended <b>with</b> metallic or <b>zerovalent</b> iron (Fe 0) and combination of Fe 0 and peat by laboratory and pilot scale field experiments. The used iron amendments were spent blasting sand (BS), a by-product from a steel industry containing 98. 3 % of Fe 0, and its combination with peat. A pilot scale landfill cover was built at Brännkläppen landfill in Northern Sweden. The untreated and treated As-contaminated soils were used as a 2 m thick vegetation/protection layer of the landfill top cover. The main exposure pathways concerning risks to human health and the environment were studied by analysing leachates from field, soil pore water, As fractionation in soil, phytotoxicity and bioaccessibility. Using the bioaccessibility results, a bioavailability of As to humans was calculated. The results showed that the stabilization of As-contaminated soil with a combination of Fe 0 and peat significantly reduced the As concentration in soil pore water, uptake by plants and improved the main morphological parameters of plants. The soil treatment also reduced the bioaccessibility and the bioavailability of As indicating the reduced risks to human health. Nevertheless, the soil treatment using Fe and peat only works under oxidizing soil conditions. Leachates collected in field below the 2 m layer showed an increased As concentration in the water percolating through the treated soil profiles over time, when compared to the leachate collected under the untreated soil. These results point out an importance of maintaining oxidizing conditions in the soil treated with Fe amendments in order to retain the positive impact of the soil treatment on As immobilization in soil. Soil layer containing the stabilized soil should be used only in the very top layer of the landfill cover. Validerat; 20131216 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} four new {{analogue}} phases Ca 2 M 2 X (M = Pd, Pt and X = Al, Ge) were prepared by direct {{combination of the}} respective elements in stoichiometric mixtures at high temperature in order to analyze the impact of valence electron count (vec) and electronegativity differences (Delta chi) on the structure selection and stability. Their crystal structures, as determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, correspond to two different but closely related structure types. The first compound, Ca 2 Pd 2 Ge (I), is an unprecedented ternary ordered variant of the Zr 2 Al 3 -type (orthorhombic, Fdd 2). The three other phases, Ca 2 Pt 2 Ge (II), Ca 2 Pd 2 Al (III) and Ca 2 Pt 2 Al (IV), adopt the Gd 2 Ge 2 Al-type structure (monoclinic, C- 2 /c). All title structures feature linear chains of the noble metals (Pd or Pt). The Pd linear chains in I are undistorted with equidistant Pd center dot center dot center dot Pd atoms, whereas the metal chains in II-IV are pairwise distorted, resulting in short connected {Pd- 2 } or {Pt- 2 } dumbbells that are separated by longer M center dot center dot center dot M contacts. The occurrence and magnitude of the pairing distortion in these chains are controlled by the vec and the Delta chi between the constituent elements, a result which is supported by analysis of the calculated Bader effective charges. The metal chains act as charge modulation units, critical for the stability and the electronic flexibility of the structures by an adequate adjustment of the metal-metal bond order to both the vec {{and the degree of}} charge transfer. Thus, Ca 2 Pd 2 Ge (28 ve/f. u) is a Zintl-like, charge optimized phase <b>with</b> formally <b>zerovalent</b> Pd atoms forming the undistorted metal chains; semimetallic properties are predicted by TB-LMTO calculations. In contrast, the isoelectronic Ca 2 Pt 2 Ge is predicted to be a good metal with the Fermi level located at a local maximum of the DOS, a fingerprint of potential electronic instability. This is due to greater charge transfer to the more electronegative Pt atoms forming the metal chains and probably to packing frustration in the well packed structure that may prevent a larger distortion of the Pt chains. However, the instability is suppressed in the aliovalent but isostructural phases Ca 2 M 2 Al (27 ve/f. u) with an enhancement of the pairing distortion within the metal chains but lower M-M bond order. Further reduction of the vec as in Ca 2 M 2 Cd (26 ve/f. u) may induce a transition toward the more geometrically flexible W 2 CoB 2 -type with a low dimensional structure, to create more room for a larger distortion of the metal chain as dictated by the shortage of valence electrons...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{reviews the}} {{literature}} concerning {{the synthesis of}} aminomethylphosphines together with the analogous ditertiary phosphines. Macrocyclic aminomethylphosphines and some water soluble phosphines are also reviewed together with {{a brief review of}} some metal complexes. The preparation and characterisation of the aminobis(methylphosphines) are presented in Chapter 2. Treatment of the phosphonium salts [R 2 P(CH 2 OH) 2]C 1 (R= Cy, Ph) with primary amines in the presence of triethylamine produced aminobis(methylphosphines) of the type (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR' where R= Cy, Ph and R'= Me, [-(CH 2) nSO 3][Et 3 NH] (n= 1, 2, 3). In addition to the above method, an ethylenediamine diacetate functionalised phosphine and a benzo- 15 -crown- 5 functionalised aminobis(methylphosphines) have also been obtained by treating Ph 2 PH with aqueous formaldehyde {{in the presence of the}} relevant primary amine in toluene. The phosphines (Cy 2 PCH 2) 2 NMe and [(Ph 2 PCH 2) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 SO 3] [Et 3 NH] have been characterised by single crystal X-ray structure determinations. In Chapter 3 a variety of transition metal complexes have been obtained using aminobis (methylphosphines) prepared in Chapter 2. The metal complexes have been characterised using spectroscopic techniques and microanalytical data. All the complexes are cis mononuclear except the rhodium complex of [(Ph 2 PCH 2) 2 N(CH 2) 2 SO 3][Et 3 NH], (dppaes) which has a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The single crystal X-ray structure determinations of the platinum, palladium and nickel complexes of the phosphines (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NMe (R= Cy, dcpam; Ph, dppam) show the phosphines in a six-membered chelate chair conformation. Treatment of platinum complexes of dcpam and dppam with silver acetate and silver carbonate in dichloromethane afforded novel acetate and carbonate derivatives respectively. Treatment of both carbonate and dichloride derivatives of platinum (II) phosphine complexes with 2 -mercapto imidazole gave four membered platinacycle complexes. Treatment of [PtCl 2 (L) ] (L= dcpam, COD, dppp) with two or three mole excess of 2 -acetamidoacrylic acid in the presence of silver oxide produced carbon-oxygen bonded isomers rather than nitrogen-oxygen bonded isomers. Some reactions of the metal dichloride complexes with Nal, tBuNC, PPh 3, HCl, CF 3 SO 3 Me have also been investigated. The last Chapter investigates the synthesis, characterisations and some reactions of zerovalent platinum and palladium aminobis (methylphosphine) complexes of the type [M(dba) (P-P) ] (M= Pt, Pd; P-P= dcpam, dppam). The complexes have been characterised by means of spectroscopic and microanalytical data. The complex [Pd(dba) (dcpam) ] has also been characterised by a single crystal X-ray structure determination. The platinum complex [Pt(dba) (dcpam) ] does not react with carbon monoxide, dmad or diphenylacetylene. However, the dba ligand in the corresponding palladium complex is displaced by dmad and fumaronitrile. A zerovalent mixed phosphine-platinum complex has been prepared by reducing either [PtCl 2 (dcpam) ] with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol followed by addition of triphenylphosphine or reducing [PtCl 2 (PPh 3) 2] followed by addition of dcpam to give [Pt(dcpam) ((PPh 3) ].
