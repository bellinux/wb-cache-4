So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we're doing the same thing again." ...|$|E
500|$|Because Carter {{originates}} {{from the}} films, Marvel Studios co-presidents Feige and D'Esposito [...] "are very invested {{in this and}} they've been really collaborative and very generous with their world". Markus, talking about the series' place in the greater architecture of the MCU, later said [...] "you really only need to drop the tiniest bit of hint and its connected. You don't have to go, [...] "Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!"...Everything is enhanced just {{by the knowledge that}} its all connected." [...] Butters said, [...] "We always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you see us as a piece of [...] But because of our time period, we kind of are on our own a little bit." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they assumed she didn't like them. Series producer Leonard Katzman confronted her about the issue and she said, [...] "I like everybody. It's just that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E

50|$|An {{underlying}} thread {{throughout the}} book is that of familial relationships; the book opens with Detective Inspector John Rebus attending the funeral of his brother Michael, who has died suddenly from a stroke. The parents of Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke arrive in Edinburgh {{as part of the}} protests, demonstrations, and scuffles that surrounded the G8 summit at Gleneagles, keeping the police busy. Clarke defied her parents by becoming a police officer; she now <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a daughter.|$|R
500|$|Form and Fuller {{recognized}} the iconic {{status of the}} music used {{in the first four}} Friday the 13th films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, [...] "I don't believe that, when you watch a Friday the 13th film, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> John Williams is sitting next to you with the London Symphony Orchestra".|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as she had {{forgotten}} many details. She explained, [...] "I was a little embarrassed with how little I knew about it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a practicing Hindu, so I had {{to do a lot of}} research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> they pigeonholed me, but I felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of the Barnes family, Pamela was {{initially}} met with suspicion and hostility from the rival Ewing family after she had married Bobby Ewing and moved onto the Southfork Ranch to live with her new husband. The strongest hostility towards Pamela came from Bobby's older brother, J.R. Ewing, who tried to drive Pamela off Southfork Ranch with methods of bribery and intimidation, as well as trying to con Bobby into believing that Pamela {{was having an affair with}} her ex-boyfriend, Ray Krebbs. Principal, who wanted to represent her character's outsider perception of the family, would portray this with the cast. Leonard Katzman described her as being [...] "the world's most isolated lady". When confronted by Katzman about why Principal chose to be isolated from everyone else, he described the situation as: [...] "After a while, I thought, 'Maybe she doesn't like us'. I went to see her. She said, 'No, I like everybody. It's just that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing.'"

50|$|In {{consumer}} behaviour studies, the blissful ignorance effect is when {{people who have}} good information about a product {{are not expected to}} be as happy with the product than people who have less information about it. This happens because the person who bought the product <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> they have bought the right thing. However, if the person already knows how the product works they have a tougher time trying to justify the product to themselves if it has any problems.|$|R

They reunite briefly this summer, which ultimately ends in more heartbreak because she finds out that when she broke up with Kostas, he got a woman pregnant, and now <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he has <b>to</b> marry her because of what he did.|$|R

He has also said of the company's culture, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we're on summer vacation. We work really hard, but it should be for something fun and rewarding. It's like the Mark Twain quote: 'If it feels like play, it's not really work.'" [...] Nemo offers [...] "Skateboard Wednesdays" [...] (also known as [...] "Nemo Nooners") as an employee benefit, spending $300 per month to rent out the Commonwealth Skateboarding Park for personnel and their friends for three hours each week. In addition, the firm provides evening access to a company boat housed along the Willamette River. It also offers more traditional benefits like 401(k) matching and health insurance.

I wasn't going to just record something and release shit for the sake of having a song out, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> something when I heard it, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I did when I first started, like when I used to sing in my bedroom when I was 15." ...|$|R

There's {{nothing in the}} world I wouldn't do to help you, though I know it's no use offering to do anything. You're a fighter, and you mean to fight your own battle. It might happen that, if I kept after you and badgered you and nagged you, one of these days, when you were feeling particularly all alone in the world and tired of fighting for yourself, you might consent to marry me. But it wouldn't do. Even if you reconciled yourself to it, it wouldn't do. I suppose the cave-woman sometimes felt rather relieved when everything was settled for her with a club, but I'm sure the caveman must have had a hard time ridding himself of the thought that he had behaved like a cad and taken a mean advantage. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> that. I couldn't make you happy if I felt like that.

[...] He explained that Luke's story is a main thrust of the comic, considering where the character {{is at this point}} in the timeline, adding: This is all pretty new to him. His world has changed completely. He had this mentor for five minutes who now is dead and leaves him with all these questions about his father, about his history, and where he goes from here, and what’s his role in the grand scheme of things ...
