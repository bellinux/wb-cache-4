5|$|In Costa Mesa, California, a {{young man}} named Donald Pankow {{approaches}} the drive-thru of a Lucky Boy fast food restaurant. Despite the restaurant being closed, Pankow angrily demands service. The sheepish fast food attendant tells the man to drive to the next <b>window,</b> <b>where</b> he is attacked and violently pulled out of his car. Pankow's body is later discovered with the brain removed from the skull. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are assigned to assist the local police in their investigation.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a <b>window,</b> <b>where</b> he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the <b>window,</b> <b>where</b> Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E

25|$|In its inaugural season, Rogers aired 500 games across CBC and Rogers-owned properties. On Wednesday nights, Sportsnet aired Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey; {{similarly}} to TSN under the previous contract, {{the network has}} an exclusive <b>window</b> <b>where</b> no other broadcaster may air NHL games in Canada. Sportsnet 360 and Sportsnet One will air around 100 games involving U.S. teams throughout the season; Sportsnet One primarily airs NBC Sports' Wednesday Night Rivalry games, while 360 airs games on Thursday nights. Sportsnet will also air coverage of the entry Draft. Rogers stated that in combination with its existing regional rights to the Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, and Calgary Flames, it would have an effective monopoly on all NHL telecasts in Western Canada (aside from portions of the Jets' market that are shared with the Flames and Oilers, such as Saskatchewan).|$|E
500|$|The nave is 30m (100ft) {{long and}} 14m (47ft), and is {{separated}} from the aisles on north and south sides by arcades of six bays. [...] It is lit by Perpendicular windows, each aisle bay window having four lights apiece, with three-light windows in the clerestory above. [...] The nave's oak and chestnut hammerbeam roof dates from the 15th century, and features carved angels on the hammers. These rest on arched braces, except above each <b>window,</b> <b>where</b> the hammers rest on corbels instead. The only trace of the earlier 13th-century nave is the reuse of some older stone, mainly in the north aisle, and the raised chancel walls, and some Purbeck Marble fragments beneath the west tower.|$|E

500|$|In addition, King {{had noted}} {{that two of}} the new songs had been fully {{recorded}} and that there was a possibility that they might be released as an EP, but the idea was later dismissed. King announced the songs' titles as [...] "Chasing Death" [...] and [...] "Implode." [...] Araya announced that the band would start writing the new album upon completion of the 2012 Mayhem Festival tour, which ended in August of that year. Since their recorded songs still needed to be mixed, King announced in a late August 2012 interview {{that there had been a}} twelve-day <b>window</b> <b>where</b> the band had been able to [...] "hijack Greg Fidelman from Metallica" [...] for further production on the album. By then, the band had two songs that were missing lead guitar parts and vocals and had recorded six demos. In addition, King said that the band had yet to record three more demos.|$|E
500|$|Babb {{was born}} in 1906 in Lees Creek, Ohio, USA (near Wilmington). He earned the {{nickname}} [...] "Kroger" [...] either from his childhood job at the grocer {{of the same name}} or from his father's preference for B.H. Kroger coffee. Babb held a number of jobs during his youth, gaining a mention in Ripley's Believe It Or Not for refereeing a record number of youth sports games. He started out with jobs in sportswriting and reporting at a local newspaper in his 20s, and even showed signs of his later work while showcasing [...] "Digger" [...] O'Dell, the [...] "living corpse," [...] but first achieved success after his promotion to publicity manager for the Chakeres-Warners movie theaters, where he would create different kinds of stunts to lure audiencesâ€”for example, a drawing to award two bags of groceries to one ticket holder at selected theaters. Another gimmick was to find a furniture store <b>window</b> <b>where</b> a bedroom suite was on display, and there Babb would place a large sign reading [...] "Win a bedroom suit (theatre location & date listed)". [...] This always ensured a packed house, and the [...] "lucky" [...] winner was awarded with a pair of pajamas. [...] These experiences led him to the exploitation film business.|$|E

2500|$|Once fans of {{the series}} {{discovered}} where exterior shots had been taken, the house became a popular tourist destination.

2500|$|At {{the base}} of the cochlea, each duct ends in a {{membranous}} portal that faces the middle ear cavity: The vestibular duct ends at the oval <b>window,</b> <b>where</b> the footplate of the stapes sits. The footplate vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain. [...] The wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. Since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at the round window, bulging out when the oval window bulges in.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hair cells}} in the organ of Corti are tuned to certain sound {{frequencies}} by way of their location in the cochlea, due {{to the degree of}} stiffness in the basilar membrane. [...] This stiffness is due to, among other things, the thickness and width of the basilar membrane, which {{along the length of the}} cochlea is stiffest nearest its beginning at the oval <b>window,</b> <b>where</b> the stapes introduces the vibrations coming from the eardrum. [...] Since its stiffness is high there, it allows only high-frequency vibrations to move the basilar membrane, and thus the hair cells. [...] The farther a wave travels towards the cochlea's apex (the helicotrema), the less stiff the basilar membrane is; thus lower frequencies travel down the tube, and the less-stiff membrane is moved most easily by them where the reduced stiffness allows: [...] that is, as the basilar membrane gets less and less stiff, waves slow down and it responds better to lower frequencies. [...] In addition, in mammals, the cochlea is coiled, which has been shown to enhance low-frequency vibrations as they travel through the fluid-filled coil. [...] This spatial arrangement of sound reception is referred to as tonotopy.|$|E
