5|$|Distortion in the molars is {{the most}} common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils. Sometimes the {{replacement}} was disrupted, and the molars <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had periodontal disease, with half of these containing caries. The teeth also sometimes had cancerous growths.|$|E

After this submission Bishop Thomas acted as one of the sureties for Earl William's future loyalty. The other guarantor was David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray).|$|E
5|$|So many South Vietnamese {{helicopters}} {{landed on}} the TF76 ships that some 45 UH-1 Hueys {{and at least one}} CH-47 Chinook <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> overboard to make room for more helicopters to land. Other helicopters dropped off their passengers and were then ditched into the sea by their pilots, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.|$|E
5|$|The Yosemite Firefall, {{in which}} the embers from a bonfire <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> off a cliff near Glacier Point to create a {{spectacular}} effect, was ended in 1968 because it was deemed to be inconsistent with park values. The firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry.|$|E

50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped onto the embedded stack, the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack <b>is</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped, the current stack <b>is</b> optionally <b>pushed</b> back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> both {{above and below the}} current stack.|$|R
5|$|A {{version of}} Mirror's Edge for the iPhone and iPod Touch was {{announced}} on December 2, 2009.

It was then later revealed that the iPhone and iPod Touch versions <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> back to an April release. EA Mobile released Mirror's Edge for iPhone and iPod touch on September 1, 2010. An iPad version was released on April 1, 2010. The game was also ported to Windows Phone in 2012.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|Despite being neutral at {{the start}} of World War II, Belgium and its colonial {{possessions}} found themselves at war after the country was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting in which Belgian forces <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> back into a small pocket in the north-east of the country, the Belgian military surrendered to the Germans, beginning an occupation that would endure until 1944. The surrender of 28 May was ordered by King Leopold III without the consultation of his government and sparked a political crisis after the war. Despite the capitulation, many Belgians managed to escape to the United Kingdom where they formed a government and army-in-exile on the Allied side.|$|E
50|$|The {{release date}} was shifted several times. It was {{initially}} set for May 29, 2015, but on January 26, 2015, the film <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> back to December 25, 2015, a date first assigned for Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. On May 5, 2015, the film <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> back again, to March 18, 2016. On November 10, 2015, the film's release date <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> back again, to January 13, 2017.|$|R

5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> back into the studio just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was first}} to finish the race, having {{cautiously}} driven his car to the line in very wet conditions, followed by Massa and Heidfeld. Heidfeld rose from ninth position during the final laps due to the superior grip of the intermediate tyres put on during a pit stop two laps prior {{to the end of}} the race. Fernando Alonso and Timo Glock similarly benefited from intermediate tyres, Alonso finishing fourth and Glock eighth, having passed Webber on the final corner. Conversely, Toro Rosso drivers Bourdais and Vettel, who were third and fourth with one lap to go, <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> down to seventh and fifthpositions due to the lack of grip of their dry-weather tyres.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the execution of King Louis XVI, revolutionary France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman forces from the Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, they <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman forces from the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} set for release on August 14, 2015, but on May 1, 2014, the reboot film's release date <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> back to August 5, 2016.

50|$|A notable {{difference}} is that the player has a single Vorton with an energy meter, instead of five lives; accordingly, the bomb must <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> by the player, whereas in the previous game it <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> by the player's spare Vortons.|$|R
5|$|Michael VIII countered the {{emerging}} threat by a diplomatic {{mission to the}} Papacy, which in the Second Council of Lyon (1274) agreed to the union of the Orthodox and Catholic churches, estranged after the Great Schism of 1054, and thereby placed Michael and his empire under papal protection. Taking advantage of Charles's entanglement in the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy, in spring 1274 Michael launched an attack against Angevin holdings in Albania. Berat and Buthrotum were taken and Charles's troops <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> back from the hinterland to the two ports of Valona and Dyrrhachium. Although these were assaulted several times in 1274–1275, they remained in Angevin hands.|$|E
5|$|More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to {{designate}} , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area. The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements {{to visit the}} park, such as the Firefall, in which red-hot embers <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley {{during the summer months}} has become a concern. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October, an NVA {{regiment}} attacked an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) battalion at Song Be, {{capital of}} Phuoc Long Province. The North Vietnamese fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the 273rd NLF Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp {{near the border}} town of Loc Ninh, in Binh Long Province. Troops of the US 1st Infantry Division were able to respond quickly. After a ten-day battle, the attackers <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> back into Cambodia. At least 852 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese dead.|$|E

5|$|On May 4 Peng's forces {{attacked}} {{an isolated}} supply depot in northeast Shaanxi, arrested its commander, and captured food reserves, 40,000 army uniforms, {{and a collection}} of arms that included over a million pieces of artillery. Peng's forces <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> back to the border of Inner Mongolia, but finally managed to decisively defeat Hu's forces in August, in the Battle of Shajiadian(沙家店战役), saving Mao and other members from the Central committee from being taken prisoner. Peng eventually pushed Kuomintang forces out of Shaanxi in February 1948.|$|E
5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch. Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
5|$|Replacement pilots <b>were</b> <b>pushed</b> {{through an}} {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
50|$|The {{third round}} was {{scheduled}} to be played on the weekend of 10-11 October, but the match between Gor Mahia and Palos <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> back to 14 October while the match between A.F.C. Leopards and Ulinzi Stars <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> back to 21 October.|$|R
