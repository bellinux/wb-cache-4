50|$|On July 23, Spieth won the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale, {{giving him}} his third major title. Spieth {{tied for the}} lead after a first-round 65 and held the lead {{outright}} after {{the second and third}} rounds, leaving him three shots clear of Matt Kuchar heading into the final day. However, that lead was lost after three bogeys in his opening four holes of the final round. Kuchar took the lead with five holes remaining after Spieth drove his ball 100 yards {{to the right of the}} fairway on the par-4 13th, leaving him with an unplayable lie and needing to take a drop for a one stroke penalty; Spieth limited the damage by striping a 3-iron from the practice range area and making bogey, leaving him just a shot behind Kuchar. In a show of good sportsmanship, Spieth apologized to Kuchar for the 21-minute delay to sort out his wayward tee shot. Spieth's response to that <b>wobble</b> <b>saw</b> him nearly holing his tee shot at 14 (where he would make birdie), draining a 35-foot putt for an eagle at 15, and carding birdies at 16 and 17. Spieth finished with a final round 69 â€” three strokes clear of Kuchar, who also carded a 69 - and became just the second player in history after Jack Nicklaus to win three of the four men's golf majors before his 24th birthday.|$|E

The Human Condition toured the UK, Europe, and US in 1981, and made two cassette-only releases of their live shows (Live at the Collegiate Theatre and Live in Europe). The post-PiL years <b>saw</b> <b>Wobble</b> also collaborating with Can members Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit on Czukay's solo projects (notably On the Way to the Peak of Normal and Rome Remains Rome) and Full Circle (released in 1984).|$|R
