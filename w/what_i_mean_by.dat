Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.|$|E
2500|$|One {{definition}} is that {{law is a}} system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour. In The Concept of Law Hart argued law is a [...] "system of rules"; Austin said law was [...] "the command of a sovereign, backed {{by the threat of}} a sanction"; Dworkin describes law as an [...] "interpretive concept" [...] to achieve justice in his text titled Law's Empire; and Raz argues law is an [...] "authority" [...] to mediate people's interests. Holmes said [...] "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> the law." [...] In his Treatise on Law Aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community. This definition has both positivist and naturalist elements.|$|E

When he plucked the note do [...] on one, do resonated [...] on the other, and when he plucked the note mi [...] on one, mi resonated [...] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [...] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest.

40|$|Trevor Phillips’s {{attack on}} the utility of {{multiculturalism}} – with particular reference to modern Britain, where he heads the Commission for Racial Equality – {{is a symbol of}} how globalisation is indeed helping to dissolve national frontiers. <b>What</b> do <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> this? Quite simply, {{there appears to be a}} growing consensus among western governments and decision-makers, particularly in the context of the post– 9 / 11 “war on terror” that the west must ideologically stand together.

40|$|Basically, women¿s {{empowerment}} is {{the process}} (and its outcomes) in which women ¿ individually and collectively- become active, knowledgeable and goal-oriented actors who take and/ or support initiatives to overcoming gender inequalities. Hence, women¿s empowerment refers to a strategy to achieve gender equality {{as well as to}} the inherent capacity building processes. Institutional capacity aimed at women¿s empowerment is not a clearly defined concept. Yet, effective capacity building requires conceptual clarification and common understanding among institutional actors. Therefore the following questions need to be answered: <b>what</b> do <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> institutional capacity? How can it be developed? More specifically, how can it contribute to rural women¿s empowerment and gender equality...|$|R

40|$|So we’re {{having an}} {{economic}} crisis. I say “having, ” not “had, ” {{because we have}} <b>by</b> no <b>means</b> recovered. Financial panic may have subsided, stocks may be up, but employment remains far below pre-crisis levels, and unemployment — especially long-term unemployment — remains disastrously high. And while {{you can make the}} case that the economy is slowly on the mend, slowly is the operative word. We have already been through two years of economic purgatory, and there’s no end in sight. There is a real sense in which times like these are what economists are for, just as wars are what career military officers are for. OK, maybe I can let micro-economists off the hook. But macroeconomics is, above all, about understanding and preventing or at least mitigating economic downturns. This crisis was the time for the economics profession to justify its existence, for us academic scribblers to show what all our models and analysis are good for.
