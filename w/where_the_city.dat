5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} typhoid fever in flooded areas. In Woodbury, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} turned off at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{would pay for the}} operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of European {{settlement}} the river was a summertime chain of waterholes bounded by large gum trees. Flowing through the area <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Adelaide is sited the river was sometimes invisible beneath its gravel stream bed. It frequently flooded in winter and did not reach the sea, instead ending at coastal dunes where its waters created a vast but shallow freshwater wetlands. These wetlands, known as The Reedbeds after the dominant vegetation, occupied a large area of the western Adelaide Plains and were also fed by other waterways. The river only flowed to the sea through the Port River, Barker Inlet, and Patawalonga River following heavy rain.Try: http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/Caring_for_Water_Seas/Creeks_Rivers/River_Torrens.aspx Retrieved on 9 September 2009.|$|E

5|$|Constantinople {{began to}} decline {{continuously}} {{after the end of}} the reign of Basil II in 1025. The final blow was given by the conquest of Villardouin and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> was sacked and pillaged. The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire, created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in 1204. The Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261. Constantinople's churches, defenses, and basic services were in disrepair, and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century. After the reconquest of 1261, however some of the city's monuments were restored, and some, like the two Deisis mosaics in Hagia Sofia and Kariye, were created.|$|E
5|$|Filming of {{the second}} season's {{southern}} scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The Walls of Dubrovnik and Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. The island of Lokrum, the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir, the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the Wall, in the Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland: on the Vatnajökull glacier near Smyrlabjörg, the Svínafellsjökull glacier near Skaftafell and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier near Vik on Höfðabrekkuheiði.|$|E
5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> continues to grow.|$|E

5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 59, the Romans {{marched to}} the south, towards Tigranocerta, Armenia's second capital city. On their way, Corbulo's men punished those who {{withstood}} or hid from them, while leniency was shown to those who surrendered. In the harsh, dry terrain of northern Mesopotamia, the army suffered from lack of provisions, especially water, {{until they reached the}} more fertile areas near Tigranocerta. During that time, a plot to murder Corbulo was uncovered and suppressed. Several Armenian nobles who had joined the Roman camp were implicated and executed. According to a story provided by Frontinus, when the Roman army arrived at Tigranocerta, they launched the severed head of one of the conspirators into the city. By chance, it landed right <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> council was assembled; they immediately decided to surrender the city, which was consequently spared. Shortly after, an attempt by the Parthian army under king Vologases to enter Armenia was blocked by Verulanus Severus, the commander of the auxiliaries.|$|E

Numerous buildings in Georgetown, the Sussex County seat, were evacuated while crews checked for damage; the Emergency Operations Center there reported 200 calls to 9-1-1. Delaware Department of Transportation crews were dispatched statewide to inspect interstate highways, the under-construction replacement Indian River Inlet Bridge, the Delaware Memorial Bridge on I-295, and other bridges and roads.|$|E

5|$|Population in the Sava River basin is {{estimated}} at 8,176,000, and it includes four capitals—Belgrade, Ljubljana, Sarajevo and Zagreb. All of them, except Sarajevo, are also located directly on the river banks and represent the three largest settlements found along the Sava River course. Belgrade, located at {{the confluence of the}} river, is the largest city in the basin with urban population of 1,135,502. Ten municipalities <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> is situated have combined population of 1,283,783 as suburban settlements are added, while the Belgrade metropolitan area encompasses population of 1,639,121. Zagreb is the second largest city on the river, comprising population of 688,163 living in the city itself, and 790,017 in the city-administered area. Together with the Zagreb County, largely corresponding to various definitions of the city's metropolitan area, it has a combined population of 1,110,517. Ljubljana is the third-largest city {{on the banks of the}} Sava, encompassing population of 258,873 living in the city itself and 265,881 in the city-governed area.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut.

5|$|With the Peace of Basel, the {{relations}} between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the empire returned to the status quo ante from before the Diet of Worms in 1495. The imperial ban was dropped silently. Maximilian had to accept the refusal of the cantons and to abandon implicitly the Habsburg claims on their territories, acknowledging their independence. Consequently, the then ten members of the Swiss Confederacy remained exempt from the jurisdiction of the Reichskammergericht. The Swiss henceforth exercised also the high justice over the Thurgau. The war had not caused any territorial changes, except in the area around Schaffhausen, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> had succeeded to assert its hegemony over some places that had formerly belonged to the Bishop of Constance.|$|E
