40|$|We {{develop a}} view of the MNC as a knowledge-creating and and {{utilizing}} entity, building on the extant literature on the differentiated MNC as well as on Lyles and Schwenk’s work on corporate knowledge structures. The starting point for this conceptualization is that MNC management through choices regarding organizational control, motivation and context can influence the development, characteristics and transfer of knowledge. This extends existing literature. For example, in most of the literature, the characteristics of knowledge are seen as exogenous rather than endogenous variables. However, to the extent that management chooses a specific way of sourcing knowledge, it also implicitly chooses the characteristics of the sourced knowledge and the ease with which it can be transferred inside the MNC. This is because knowledge from different knowledge sources have different characteristics and are thus transferred at different cost. The six hypotheses that <b>we</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> the <b>main</b> argument are tested {{on the basis of a}} unique and very rich dataset on subsidiary knowledge development (including information on the organizational setting, sources of subsidiary knowledge and the extent of knowledge transfer to other MNC-units) that has been constructed in connection with a cross-national project Centres of Excellence (Holm and Pedersen 2000 a).

40|$|Most recent {{research}} on the differentiated MNC has been taken up with knowledge flows between MNC units. In contrast, we develop {{a view of the}} MNC as a knowledge structure where knowledge elements in MNCs are seen as being structured along a number of dimensions (e. g., complementarity, dispersal, sources of knowledge) that help determining {{the costs and benefits of}} knowledge transfer. Based on this conceptualization, we argue that MNC management through choices regarding organizational control, motivation and context can influence the development, characteristics and transfer of knowledge. This further extends existing literature. For example, in most of the literature, the characteristics of knowledge are seen as exogenous rather than endogenous variables. However, to the extent that management chooses a specific way of sourcing knowledge, it also implicitly chooses the characteristics of the sourced knowledge and the ease with which it can be transferred inside the MNC.

Further, coworker exchange mitigated the positive relation between anxiety and emotional exhaustion, while leader-member exchange mitigated the negative relation between emotional exhaustion and job performance. This study elucidates the effects of workplace anxiety on resource depletion via emotional exhaustion and highlights the value of drawing on social resources to offset the potentially harmful effects of workplace anxiety on job performance.
