25|$|At {{the same}} time some of the Spanish ships were still a {{presence}} {{off the coast of}} England; milling about in confusion without being able to make any harbour. Eventually with a <b>wind</b> <b>astern,</b> the order was given by Brochero to head back to Spain and they sailed back in disorder to Corunna.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning with}} a fair <b>wind</b> <b>astern</b> we had buzzed {{around the corner of}} England and were running down the Channel.|$|E
60|$|About noon {{the next}} day, the gale so moderated that we shook two reefs {{out of the}} top-sails, set new courses, and stood due east, with the <b>wind</b> <b>astern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Both sheets aft, The {{situation}} of a square-rigged ship that sails before the wind, {{or with the}} <b>wind</b> right <b>astern.</b> It is said also of a half-drunken sailor rolling along {{with his hands in}} his pockets and elbows square." ...|$|R
6000|$|The calm gone by, {{once again}} my sea-tailor plied needle and thread; or turning laundress, hung our raiment to dry on oars peaked obliquely in the thole-pins. All of which tattered pennons, the <b>wind</b> being <b>astern,</b> helped us gayly on our way; as jolly poor devils, with rags {{flying in the}} breeze, sail blithely through life; and are merry {{although}} they are poor! ...|$|R
60|$|The skipper {{nodded and}} slackened out the sheet {{a bit as}} the <b>wind</b> came more <b>astern.</b> He kept his eyes fixed ahead of him, and the men kept gazing through the gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... “But it {{will serve}} {{only when we}} are sailing by the wind,” I explained. “When running more freely, with the <b>wind</b> <b>astern</b> abeam, or on the quarter, it will be {{necessary}} for me to steer.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Impracticable Cape! You may {{approach}} it from this direction or that--in {{any way you}} please--from the East or from the West; with the <b>wind</b> <b>astern,</b> or abeam, or on the quarter; and still Cape Horn is Cape Horn. Cape Horn it is that takes the conceit out of fresh-water sailors, and steeps in a still salter brine the saltest. Woe betide the tyro; the fool-hardy, Heaven preserve! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you could}} see Sol Gills, young gen'l'm'n,' said the Captain, impressively, and laying his heavy hand on Mr Toots's knee, 'old Sol, mind you--with your own eyes--as you sit there--you'd be welcomer to me, than a <b>wind</b> <b>astern,</b> to a ship becalmed. But you can't see Sol Gills. And why can't you see Sol Gills?' said the Captain, apprised by the face of Mr Toots that {{he was making a}} {{profound}} impression on that gentleman's mind. 'Because he's inwisible.' ...|$|E
60|$|He paddled {{harder and}} a small white wave lapped the canoe's bows. The sky was getting dark, and now the lines that {{streaked}} the lake were white, but the <b>wind</b> was <b>astern</b> {{and they were going}} fast. The glimmering reflections had vanished and the rocks ahead rose sharply from the leaden water. The point was some distance off, but Lister knew he must reach it soon.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Moby Dick, the narrator states: ...I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the {{wholesome}} exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than <b>winds</b> from <b>astern</b> (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim)... The Pythagoreans led an ascetic lifestyle which included a prohibition against the consumption of beans.|$|R
60|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the <b>wind</b> was now <b>astern,</b> the heat was so intense that Captain Davenport was {{compelled}} to steal sidelong glances into the binnacle, letting go the wheel now with one hand, now with the other, to rub or shield his blistering cheeks.|$|R
60|$|After a {{fair and}} uneventful voyage of six weeks, I beheld again my native shores in the low spits of the Virginia capes. The sand was very hot and white, and {{the waters of the}} Chesapeake rolled like oil under the July sun. We were all day getting over to Yorktown, the ship's destination. A {{schooner}} was sailing for Annapolis early the next morning, and I barely had time to get off my baggage and catch her. We went up the bay with a fresh <b>wind</b> <b>astern,</b> which died down at night.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{beginning}} to get tired," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "We are going a good deal faster, of course, now we have got the <b>wind</b> <b>astern,</b> but I do not {{think they are going}} as fast as they did, and I expect that last dose of buck-shot took the heart out of them a good deal. They had reckoned that we should be only able to fire once or twice before they came up, and that I should use bullets; but that handful of buck-shot evidently peppered a good many of them, and they know if they come up they will have four more barrels at least among them. I think the fighting is all over now." ...|$|E
60|$|Pale {{moonlight}} trembled {{across the}} foaming sea and faded {{again as the}} Rowan, rolling hard, bore up for the Solway. Whitney held the helm, his lips set and his brows knitted, for with the savage <b>wind</b> <b>astern</b> the yacht was hard to steer. The small storm-jib ran water as it swung above the seas, and the black, close-reefed mainsail lurched to and fro, lifting its heavy boom high above Whitney's head, {{at the risk of}} carrying away the mast if he let it jibe across. Andrew stood in the cockpit, with the spray rattling like shot on his oilskins, his night glasses steadied on the cabin top as he searched the sea ahead. He saw enough to daunt a stranger to the firth.|$|E
60|$|Obedient to orders, Leo {{pulled the}} {{regulator}} or check-string until the kite's position was altered {{so as to}} present less resistance to the <b>wind,</b> and dropped <b>astern</b> of the Faith, which was the name given by Benjy to his father's boat, the other two being named respectively the Hope and the Charity.|$|R
60|$|But the Snark sailed. It was {{the only}} way she could get anywhere. She sailed for two years, and never touched rock, reef, nor shoal. She had no inside ballast, her iron keel weighed five tons, but her deep draught and high {{freeboard}} made her very stiff. Caught under full sail in tropic squalls, she buried her rail and deck many times, but stubbornly refused to turn turtle. She steered easily, and she could run day and night, without steering, close-by, full- and-by, and with the wind abeam. With the wind on her quarter and the sails properly trimmed, she steered herself within two points, and with the <b>wind</b> almost <b>astern</b> she required scarcely three points for self-steering.|$|R
50|$|Virginia left Baltimore late in March in {{obedience}} to the Maritime Committees orders. Nicholsons plans called for Virginia to sail first to Annapolis, {{to pick up a}} bay pilot promised by Governor Johnson. Completing this, the frigate and pilot vessel weighed anchor off Annapolis on 30 March and proceeded down the bay, plotting a night passage into the Atlantic. However, early on the morning of 31 March, Virginia grounded with a tremendous crash on the so-called Middle Ground between the capes, opposite the city of Hampton, Virginia. With a strong <b>wind</b> blowing <b>astern,</b> the surf pounded the frigate and forced her over. Her rudder snapped before she could be cleared and was soon lost. Once in the channel, Virginia was anchored and repairs begun.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it may, so it may, Peters; I did {{not think}} of that. Certainly that is likely enough. We know they have several ships {{cruising}} in the Zuider Zee keeping a lookout for the beggars. On a night like this, and with the <b>wind</b> <b>astern,</b> the sound will be heard miles away. We may have trouble yet. I was not much afraid of the galleys, for though the wind is so light we are running along famously. You see we have nothing in our hold, and that is all in our favour so long as we are dead before the wind. Besides, if the galleys did come up it would probably be singly, and {{we should be able to}} beat them off, for high out of water as we are they would find it difficult to climb the sides; but if we fall in with any of their ships it is a different matter altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{you have}} often heard from my lips {{the story of}} my mother, I must for the sake of those who are to come after you, set it down here as briefly as I may. My grandfather's bark 'Charming Sally', Captain Stanwix, having set out from Bristol on the 15th of April, 1736, with a fair <b>wind</b> <b>astern</b> and a full cargo of English goods below, near the Madeiras fell in with foul weather, which {{increased}} as she entered the trades. Captain Stanwix being a prudent man, shortened sail, knowing the harbour of Funchal to be but a shallow bight in the rock, and worse than the open sea in a southeaster. The third day he hove the Sally to; being a stout craft and not overladen she weathered the gale with the loss of a jib, and was about making topsails again when a full-rigged ship was descried in the offing giving signals of distress. Night was coming on very fast, and the sea was yet running too high for a boat to live, but the gallant captain furled his topsails once more to await the morning. It could be seen from her signals that the ship was living throughout the night, but at dawn she foundered before the Sally's boats could be put in the water; one of them was ground to pieces on the falls. Out of the ship's company and passengers they picked up but five souls, four sailors and a little girl of two years or thereabouts. The men knew nothing more of her than that she had come aboard at Brest with her mother, a quiet, delicate lady who spoke little with the other passengers. The ship was 'La Favourite du Roy', bound for the French Indies.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time some of the Spanish ships were still a {{presence}} {{off the coast of}} England; milling about in confusion without being able to make any harbour. Eventually with a <b>wind</b> <b>astern,</b> the order was given by Brochero to head back to Spain and they sailed back in disorder to Corunna.|$|E
60|$|After {{they had}} feasted {{themselves}} here for some days, they resolved {{to begin their}} new kind of navigation, and {{to see what they}} could make of it; but they went very heavily along, and every now and then, as I have said, the water was too rough for them, and they were fain to put into harbour, and sometimes lie there two or three days. However, they plyed their time as well as they could, and sometimes the current setting over to their side, and running strong by the shore, they would go at a great rate, insomuch that one time they said they went about thirty miles in a day, having, besides the current, a little gale of <b>wind</b> right <b>astern.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Spinnakers have {{traditionally}} been optimized to mobilize drag as a more important propulsive component than lift. As sailing craft are able to achieve higher speeds, whether on water, ice or land, the velocity made good (VMG) at a given course off the wind occurs at apparent wind angles that are increasingly further forward with speed. This suggests that the optimum VMG for a given course {{may be in a}} regime where a spinnaker may be providing significant lift. Traditional displacement sailboats may at times have optimum VMG courses close to downwind; for these the dominant force on sails is from drag. According to Kimball,CD ≈ 4/3 for most sails with the apparent <b>wind</b> angle <b>astern,</b> so drag force on a downwind sail becomes substantially a function of area and wind speed, approximated as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a little}} past midnight, and, with the <b>wind</b> nearly <b>astern,</b> we were running down Lower San Francisco Bay to Bay Farm Island. Paul Fairfax and I {{went to the same}} school, lived next door to each other, and [...] "chummed it" [...] together. By saving money, by earning more, and by each of us {{foregoing}} a bicycle on his birthday, we had collected the purchase-price of the Mist, a beamy twenty-eight-footer, sloop-rigged, with baby topsail and centerboard. Paul's father was a yachtsman himself, and he had conducted the business for us, poking around, overhauling, sticking his penknife into the timbers, and testing the planks with the greatest care. In fact, it was on his schooner, the Whim, that Paul and I had picked up what we knew about boat-sailing, and now that the Mist was ours, we were hard at work adding to our knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Coro {{was held}} for about two days and on {{preparing}} a ransom Preston had learned that a rain storm had struck the English anchorage. The cables of Somers’s fifty man pinnace had parted which was then driven out to sea. Preston therefore ordered Coro thoroughly sacked and torched; all the buildings were destroyed including the church and chapel. Preston hastened his column back to the coast and to set sail in order to search for Somers. The following evening Somers stood just outside Lake Maracaibo's entrance seeking safety, but with the wind up they both decided to leave and with <b>wind</b> <b>astern</b> headed towards Hispaniola on 26 June.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{after three}} days of {{variable}} winds, we have caught the north-east trades. I came on deck, after a good night’s rest in spite of my poor knee, to find the Ghost foaming along, wing-and-wing, and every sail drawing except the jibs, with a fresh breeze astern. Oh, the wonder of the great trade-wind! All day we sailed, and all night, and the next day, and the next, day after day, the <b>wind</b> always <b>astern</b> and blowing steadily and strong. The schooner sailed herself. There was no pulling and hauling on sheets and tackles, no shifting of topsails, no work at all for the sailors to do except to steer. At night when the sun went down, the sheets were slackened; in the morning, when they yielded up the damp of the dew and relaxed, they were pulled tight again—and that was all.|$|R
60|$|We {{made our}} journey through an incessant {{snowstorm}} on Wednesday night; at last got snowed up among the Welsh mountains in a tremendous storm of wind, {{came to a}} stop, and had to dig the engine out. We went to bed at Holyhead at {{six in the morning}} of Thursday, and got aboard the packet at two yesterday afternoon. It blew hard, but as the <b>wind</b> was right <b>astern,</b> we only rolled and did not pitch much. As I walked about on the bridge all the four hours, and had cold salt beef and biscuit there and brandy-and-water, you will infer that my Channel training has not worn out.|$|R
60|$|But by {{this time}} the sails of the vice admiral had filled with a strong land breeze that was blowing up the harbor, whereupon the carpenter, at Captain Morgan's orders, having cut away both anchors, the galleon {{presently}} bore away up the harbor, gathering headway every moment with the <b>wind</b> nearly dead <b>astern.</b> The nearest vessel {{was the only one that}} for the moment was able to offer any hindrance. This ship, having {{by this time}} cleared away one of its guns, was able to fire a parting shot against the vice-admiral, striking her somewhere forward, as our hero could see by a great shower of splinters that flew up in the moonlight.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, {{the early}} part of the day, before the swell came up, was very pleasant; sailing, as we were, in a bright {{sunshine}} and with many mountainous islands upon different sides. Alan and I sat in the round-house with the doors open on each side (the <b>wind</b> being straight <b>astern),</b> and smoked a pipe or two of the captain's fine tobacco. It was at this time we heard each other's stories, which was the more important to me, as I gained some knowledge of that wild Highland country on which I was so soon to land. In those days, so close on the back of the great rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he went upon the heather.|$|R
6000|$|Finally, I {{always go}} to sea as a sailor, because of the {{wholesome}} exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than <b>winds</b> from <b>astern</b> (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so {{for the most part}} the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way-- he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this: ...|$|R
