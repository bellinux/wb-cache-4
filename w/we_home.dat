A lady appeared suddenly. A real lady, {{in a black}} dress and with a parasol. She looked extremely elegant in the midst of us, and as strange as if she had fallen there from the sky. Mr. Baker touched his cap to her. It was the master's wife. And very soon the Captain, dressed very smartly and in a white shirt, went with her over the side. We didn't recognise him at all till, turning on the quay, he called to Mr. Baker:--"Don't forget to wind up the chronometers to-morrow morning." [...] An underhand lot of seedy-looking chaps with shifty eyes wandered {{in and out of the}} forecastle looking for a job--they said.--"More likely for something to steal," [...] commented Knowles, cheerfully. Poor beggars. Who cared? Weren't <b>we</b> <b>home!</b> But Mr. Baker went for one of them who had given him some cheek, and we were delighted. Everything was delightful.--"I've finished aft, sir," [...] called out Mr. Creighton.--"No water in the well, sir," [...] reported for the last time the carpenter, sounding-rod in hand. Mr. Baker glanced along the decks at the expectant group of sailors, glanced aloft at the yards.--"Ough! That will do, men," [...] he grunted. The group broke up. The voyage was ended.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{cognitive}} sciences, cognition {{tends to be}} interpreted from an anthropocentric perspective, involving a stringent set of human capabilities. Instead, we suggest that cognition is better explicated as a much more general biological phenomenon, allowing the lower bound of cognition to extend much further down the phylogenetic scale. We argue that elementary forms of cognition can already be witnessed in prokaryotes possessing a functional sensorimotor analogue of the nervous system. Building on a case-study of the Escherichia coli bacterium and its sensorimotor system, the TCST-system, <b>we</b> <b>home</b> in {{on the characteristics of}} minimal cognition, and distinguish it from more basic forms of ontogenetic adaptation. In our view, minimal cognition requires an embodiment consisting of a sensorimotor coupling mechanism that subsumes an autopoietic organization; this forms the basis of the growing consensus that the core of cognition revolves around sensorimotor coupling. We discuss the relevance of our interpretation of minimal cognition for the study of cognition in general...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{reasoning}} about partially ordered events in Kowalski and Sergot's Event Calculus (EC). <b>We</b> <b>home</b> in on EC between its skeptical (SKEC) and credulous (CREC) variants. When only partial knowledge about event ordering is given SKEC and CREC compute the set of maximal validity intervals (MVIs) over which the considered properties are necessarily and possibly true, respectively. The results obtainable with these two variants are amenable of a rather intuitive modal logic interpretation: SKEC computes all MVIs that will be true in whatever completion of the given partial ordering, while CREC derives those MVIs that are true in at least one completion of the given ordering. Finally, the practical relevance of the calculi is shown on a diagnostic case study. 1 Introduction This paper studies the application of Sergot and Kowalski's Event Calculus [7, 11] (hereinafter EC) to situations where information about the ordering of events is incomplete [1, 12].

40|$|In recent years, {{developmental}} {{psychologists have}} increasingly {{been interested in}} various forms of prosocial behavior observed in infants and young children—in particular comforting, sharing, pointing to provide information, and spontaneous instrumental helping. We briefly review several models that have been proposed to explain the psychological mechanisms underpinning these behaviors. Focusing on spontaneous instrumental helping, <b>we</b> <b>home</b> in on models based upon what Paulus (Child Development Perspectives 8 (2) : 77 – 81, 2014) has dubbed ‘goal-alignment’, i. e. {{the idea that the}} identification of an agent’s goal leads infants to take up that goal as their own. We identify a problem with the most well-known model based upon this idea, namely the ‘goal contagion’ model. The problem arises from {{the way in which the}} model specifies the content of the goal which is identified and taken up. We then propose an alternative way of specifying the content of the goal, and use this as a starting point for articulating an alternative model based upon the idea of alignment, namely the ‘goal slippage’ model. By elucidating the difference between goal contagion and goal slippage, we contribute to the articulation of experimental criteria for assessing whether and when the mechanisms specified by these two models are at work...|$|E
40|$|For centuries, optical {{microscopy}} has greatly facilitated our observation {{and understanding of}} microcosm. The innovation of {{optical microscopy}} technology has been proven to be {{the driving force behind}} the development of biology and medicine. In the past two decades, much effector has been devoted to the development of nonlinear optical (NLO) microscope based on different kinds of NLO contrast mechanisms. The NLO microscope provides a range of unprecedented capabilities, including larger penetration depth, inherent 3 -D optical sectioning and less photo-toxicity, etc. Its application in bio-related research has been widely explored. In particular, intrinsic NLO signals of two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation (SHG), third harmonic generation (THG), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), have emerged as popular contrast mechanisms for the imaging of a variety of biomedical specimens in vivo. This Ph. D. research focuses on developing label free and multimodal NLO microscopy and exploring its biological and biomedical applications. First <b>we</b> <b>home</b> built a TPEF microscope that can provide simultaneous time- and spectral-resolved detection capabilities. This is the foundation for more advanced multimodal NLO microscopy. Then we extended the excitation wavelength range of the standard Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser by incorporating supercontinuum light generated from photonic crystal fiber. This allows the construction of a multi-color excitation two-photon microscope, which can simultaneously acquire the TPEF signals of multiple fluorophores and SHG signal of collagen. Moreover, using the spectrally extended excitation source, we discovered, for the first time, that hemoglobin emits strong Soret band fluorescence, when it is two-photon excited by the visible light. This enables TPEF microscopy to become a powerful tool for in vivo label-free imaging of microvasculature in tissues. Furthermore, we developed a multimodal NLO microscope that integrates the multiplex CARS (M-CARS), TPEF and SHG together. In our M-CARS measurement, the nonresonant background can be effectively reduced by a simple subtraction method. Finally, the system is upgraded to SRS based multimodal microscope integrating the SRS of CH 3 stretching, TPEF of tryptophan and Flavoproteins, sum frequency generation (SFG) of collagen and THG into a single platform. At the same time, we explore the biomedical application opportunities of each kind of these NLO microscopy techniques...|$|E
