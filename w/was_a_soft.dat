5|$|Wells was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Forces Korea, in 1953. Assuming the role on 11 February, {{he led the}} Commonwealth contingent for the next twenty-one months as the Korean War {{was coming to an}} end. Like his predecessors in the position, Wells exercised administrative command only, and had no direct control over battlefield operations. Though its incumbents were considered to have performed well, the role garnered little credit for helping facilitate combat success but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> target for criticism when operations did not run smoothly. Wells had been sent to Korea with no instructions regarding the withdrawal of troops and—as armistice talks appeared on the verge of success—he was closely involved in liaison with the heads of Commonwealth governments regarding General Mark Clark's requests for their commitment to retain forces in the theatre for some period following the end of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> target because of his race.|$|E

25|$|Even though {{getting a}} family and working as an {{ordinary}} teacher occupied much of his time, Stubø {{is regarded as the}} best Norwegian guitarist through all time. His first record Notice (Odin Records, 1981), with Henning Gravrok (saxophones), Bjørn Alterhaug (bass), Terje Bjørklund (piano) and Ernst-Wiggo Sandbakk (drums), all musicians from Northern Norway. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> flowing album with references to Chick Corea's Jazz rock style, and was rewarded Spellemannprisen 1981. His next record, Live at Jazz Alive (Odin Records, 1983/1985), a live recording from the Jazz club Jazz Alive in Oslo, with Bernt Rosengren, Egil Kapstad, Terje Venaas and Egil Johansen, some of the best bop musicians in Scandinavia. These two records was released on the Norwegian Jazz Clubs own label, Odin Records.|$|E
500|$|The Sundays enjoyed {{dressing}} {{well and}} dressing their children well; the family sported expensive but tasteful coats, boots, and jewelry. Nell Sunday also bought land as an investment. In 1909, the Sundays bought an apple orchard in Hood River, Oregon, where they vacationed for several years.

Neither of the Sundays were extravagant spenders. Although Sunday enjoyed driving, the couple never owned a car. In 1911, the Sundays moved to Winona Lake, Indiana, and built an American Craftsman-style bungalow, which they called [...] "Mount Hood", probably {{as a reminder of}} their Oregon vacation cabin. The bungalow, furnished in the popular Arts and Crafts style, had two porches and a terraced garden but only nine rooms, [...] of living space, and no garage.|$|E
500|$|It {{is rated}} PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for [...] "intense {{sequences}} of sci-fi violence, action, and language," [...] unlike {{the first three}} films which are rated R. The decision to release the film with a PG-13 rating has met with much criticism from fans, {{as well as the}} media. The rating decision was made after McG cut out a shot of Marcus stabbing a thug with a screwdriver, as the director felt disallowing the young audience due to that one shot was unfair. He also deleted a topless scene for Moon Bloodgood because [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> moment {{between a man and a}} woman that was designed to echo the Kelly McGillis/Harrison Ford moment in Witness [...] in the end, it felt more like a gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture, and I didn't want that to convolute the story or the characters." [...] The producers had expected the rating because of the modern leniency towards violence in PG-13 films, such as the 2007 action film, Live Free or Die Hard.|$|E

500|$|Crockett's calls {{provoked}} a varied {{response from the}} media, which often ran counter to their state allegiances. The New South Wales journalist Davis felt that Marsh's deliberate throws raised [...] "uncertainty", while the Australasian's cricket writer Tom Horan—a Victorian who went by the pen name Felix—felt that Marsh <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> target for Crockett, whom he regarded as a suspicious character. Curran's previous calling of Marsh in the Sydney competition had strengthened Crockett's position away from his parochial state base. The Victorian umpire {{was regarded as a}} tough-minded umpire, much like Jim Phillips, who had triggered the current round of throwing calls in Australian cricket. Crockett was commended for his willingness to call Marsh in the face of public anger and for doing what others would not. When Marsh bowled from the other end in the second innings of the match, his action was deemed by Crockett's umpiring partner Sammy Jones to be fair. By this time, Marsh's confidence was low. He took his worst ever first-class figures of 1/105 as New South Wales lost by one wicket. His only wicket was Test player Charlie McLeod, bowled for six.|$|E

2500|$|Cast iron used in rails proved {{unsatisfactory}} {{because it}} was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The wrought iron invented by John Birkinshaw in 1820 replaced cast iron. Wrought iron (usually simply referred to as [...] "iron") was a ductile material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But iron was expensive to produce until Henry Cort patented the puddling process in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the rolling process, which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering. These processes greatly lowered the cost of producing iron and rails. The next important development in iron production was hot blast developed by James Beaumont Neilson (patented 1828), which considerably reduced the amount of coke (fuel) or charcoal needed to produce pig iron. Wrought iron <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> material that contained included slag or dross. The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments {{in the production of}} iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.|$|E
2500|$|Meena Kumari herself {{once said}} that people picked strands of her hair to make a taweez (talisman) out of it. One of the most {{remarkable}} facts about her acting resided in the fact that she never used products like glycerin in order to shed tears, but always shed her genuine ones while acting. Indian Film Critic Bhawana Somaaya says: [...] "There was a time when top heros were not willing to work with Meena Kumari, because she played the powerful roles". Vinod Mehta shares: [...] "Meena Kumari become so powerful that she would make or break stars, Kumari adopted an attitude of guardian, artistic mentor towards the newcomers who worked opposite her like Rajendra Kumar in Chirag Kahan Roshni Kahan and with Sunil Dutt in Ek Hi Raasta." [...] Meena Kumari helped Dharmendra enormously in the initial stages of his career, and established Dharmendra's acting career in Indian Cinema. The legendary Kathak master Pandit Lachhu Maharaj’s praise for Meena Kumari’s dance when he remarked on the unique way in which she would take a turn. [...] "The way in which she would turn, the angles of her shoulders, come naturally to her and cannot be taught." [...] Ashok Kumar said: [...] "Meena was a natural actress. She was very choosy, but once she accepted a role, she put her heart into it and it’s not surprising that she’s still remembered for her sensitive portrayals. Sometimes when saying a dialogue I'd add a line not in the script and even as I worried about how Meena would react, she’d surprise me with just the right response." [...] Amitabh Bachchan said [...] "Meenaji <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> spoken gentle lady, always appreciative of the work done by new comers, she was extremely kind to me at the trial and ever since always most encouraging whenever I got a chance to meet her. Meena Kumari's greatness lay in her immense talent and humaneness". Javed Akhtar shares: [...] "Young Indian women used to emulate Kumari's dignified sober fashion styles, the way Kumari wore a saree, her hair style, her bindi style, and {{this was the first time}} an Indian actress achieved such status and fame. Meena Kumari undoubtedly, became the [...] "First Female Style Icon of Indian Cinema." ...|$|E
