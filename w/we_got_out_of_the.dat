500|$|... "The first winter at {{the naval}} college was {{absolute}} hell, we had no uniforms, we arrived in what we stood up in and had to send home for further clothing. A case of measles broke out very shortly and we were quarantined, and the only time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> college was {{when we went to}} the skating rink to play hockey; and that was a great relief." [...] – Admiral Murray.|$|E
500|$|The third single, [...] "All My Life", was {{released}} on March 17, 1998, and was the duo's most successful song. JoJo wrote the song about his daughter but originally intended it for another artist. In an interview with MTV, he said, [...] "The song was originally supposed to be used for… another artist, a female artist on A Records. But we listened to it after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio and it was like, 'I'm keeping this, this is too hot. [...] "All My Life" [...] peaked at {{number one on the}} Hot 100 and R/Hip-Hop Songs, tying a record set by The Beatles by jumping from 15th to first on the U.S. charts. It was also a number-one song in Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. It peaked at second on the Norwegian Singles Chart, third on the Flanders Belgium Singles Chart, fourth on the Swedish Singles Chart and the Swiss Singles Chart, eighth on the UK Singles Chart, 11th on the Wallonia Belgium Singles Chart, 12th on the Austrian Singles Chart, and 43rd on the French Singles Chart. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and gold by IFPI Sweden. [...] "All My Life" [...] was nominated for Best R Video at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
2500|$|It was Ferrari's eighth one-two {{finish of}} the season. Barrichello said [...] "To win, it was very, very, very good... I {{got to the}} last corner, I didn't {{know what to do}} and nothing has been said. Michael was just very kind to, you know, let us finish equally. I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?" [...] Schumacher said [...] "The end of the race was not planned... We tried to cross the line {{together}} but failed by a tiny bit and in fact we did not know who had won until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars. I just felt Rubens deserved to win this race." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} easy for her," [...] said the Tin Owl; [...] "but I'm glad she was too angry to think <b>of</b> that before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her Valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|Me and old Mack Lonsbury, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that Little Hide-and-Seek {{gold mine}} affair with about $40,000 apiece. I say [...] "old" [...] Mack; but he wasn't old. Forty-one, I should say; {{but he always}} seemed old.|$|R
60|$|At last <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> England, and I {{was still}} a free man. The chaise (we were posting again) brought us into a dirty town, and drew up {{at the door of}} a shabby inn. A shock-headed girl {{received}} us.|$|R
2500|$|Galima Bukharbaeva, a {{journalist}} for IWPR, witnessed a [...] "mass of dead and wounded. At first, {{one group of}} armoured-personnel carriers approached the [...] square, and then another group appeared. They opened fire without mercy on everyone indiscriminately, including women and children. The crowd began to run in all directions. We dove into a ditch and lay there for a while. I saw at least five bloody corpses next to me. The rebels who are holding the provincial administration opened fire in response. They intend to stand to the end! When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ditch, we ran along the streets into the neighbourhood and now we're {{looking for a place}} where there's no shooting. But shots can be heard everywhere..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course!" [...] replied Harry. [...] "I {{might have}} thought of it, but I've been kind of dazed since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's odd how {{the scent}} will die {{away at a}} moment. You see they couldn't carry on a field after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copse." ...|$|E
60|$|Then we started, {{and really}} our transit was quite lively, {{for all those}} Basutos began what for them was rapid firing. I think, however, that their best shots must have fallen, for not a bullet touched us, {{although}} before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their range one or two went very near.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would call}} me foolish if I told you what I was {{thinking}} about. Never mind, it has gone wherever thoughts go. I {{will tell you what}} I am thinking about now, which is--that it is about time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this place. My uncle and Bessie must be half distracted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Know Belllounds? Me? Wal, he's {{the best}} friend I ever had when I was at Kremmlin'. I lived there several years. My husband had stock there. In fact, Bill started us in the cattle business. But <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there an' come here, where Bob died, an' I've been stuck ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was that a tree went down?" [...] asked Randolph Rover, and Cujo nodded. [...] "It {{is a good}} thing, then, that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} grandmother; [...] "that is a round-about way. But {{it was very}} rough and stony. Presently, Samuel stopped and said, 'Father, {{it seems to me}} it is pretty stony; haven't <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least." [...] She smiled her sweetest as she {{answered}} him,--but {{yet it was}} not very sweet. [...] "Of course we were tired and cross when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train. People always are; aren't they?" ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{recall the}} session as being {{accompanied}} by heavy marijuana use. [...] "We used to smoke dope from when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed to when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back to bed," [...] recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: [...] "You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your ears." [...] Joyce said the band even replaced the studio's light bulbs with red ones for [...]|$|R
6000|$|We {{were sent}} back to the island, and were quarantined again; though it was for twenty days, this time. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> pratique, <b>we</b> learned that some one had told of the manner in which <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison, and cross-bars had been placed in all the windows, making them so many [...] "nine of diamonds." [...] This was {{blocking}} the channel, and there was no more chance for getting off in that way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on the bridge," [...] said Mr. Moorshed. I saw no bridge, {{but fell}} over {{some sort of}} conning-tower forward, near which was a wheel. For {{the next few minutes}} I was more {{occupied}} with cursing my own folly than with the science of navigation. Therefore I cannot say how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Weymouth Harbour, nor why it was necessary to turn sharp to the left and wallow {{in what appeared to be}} surf.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> omnibus I had, however, {{observed}} one undesirable {{result of}} my absence from home. Eunice and Miss Jillgall--the latter having, no doubt, finely flattered the former--appeared to have taken a strong liking to each other.|$|E
60|$|The road being narrow, and our {{vehicle in}} its centre, {{it was not}} {{possible}} for the new-comers to proceed until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, and the divine pulled up as soon as he reached the spot where we stood.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garden," [...] says Linsenbarth, {{silent on}} this point, [...] "the four Officers {{were still there}} upon the Esplanade [Captains of Guard belike]; {{they went into the}} Palace with the King,"--clearly meaning to dine with his Majesty.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I lifted you up, sir, I {{certainly}} {{intended to}} get up behind you; but the Afridis were so close that I {{felt that it was}} impossible to do so, and that we should both be shot down before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range; so I gave the horse a prod with my sword and, as I saw him go off at a gallop, I threw down my arms, as I told you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shanghaied, I guess!" [...] he said. [...] "Well, I don't {{blame you}} for showing your grit. The master of that lumber wagon is a blame avaricious insect! He beat us down until all <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him will hardly pay for the coal we used--that's what he did. So if you slip ashore quietly when we tie up, he'll think you pitched over making sail, and I'll keep my mouth shut." ...|$|R
5000|$|Exile on Main St. {{was written}} and {{recorded}} between 1969 and 1972. Mick Jagger said [...] "After <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our contract with Allen Klein, we didn't {{want to give}} him earlier tracks," [...] as they were forced to do with [...] "Brown Sugar" [...] and [...] "Wild Horses" [...] from Sticky Fingers (1971). Many tracks were recorded between 1969 and 1971 at Olympic Studios and Jagger's Stargroves country house in England during sessions for Sticky Fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} about our 'Pilgrim's Progress'," [...] answered Beth, who had not heard a word. [...] "How <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slough and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying, and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, {{is going to be}} our Palace Beautiful." ...|$|E
60|$|That May {{he went up}} to Dalhousie {{with his}} mother, and in those days the journey ended in fifty or sixty miles of uphill travel in a doolie or palanquin, along a road winding through the Himalayas. Adam sat in the doolie with his mother,and Strickland rode and tied with me, a spare doolie following. The march began after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train at Pathankot, in a hot night among the rice - and poppy-fields.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} you {{would be likely to}} be ill so long as you might have been had you {{encountered}} a gale directly <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river, but I think that if it comes on rough all those addicted to sea-sickness are likely to suffer more or less. Some people are ill every time rough weather comes along, however long the voyage. I suppose you don't know yet whether you are a good sailor or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The light {{died from}} his eyes and his fingers relaxed their grasp on hers. [...] "Please forgive me," [...] he murmured. [...] "I {{intended}} waiting until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this mess and you were safe among your own people. It {{must have been the}} shock or something like that, and seeing you defending me as you did. Anyway, I couldn't help it and really it doesn't make much difference what I say now, does it?" ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{the account}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them, after <b>we</b> had {{taught them to}} speak English, and to {{understand}} the names {{and use of the}} things belonging to the ship which they had occasion to speak of; and we observed that the fellows were too innocent to dissemble in their relation, and that they all agreed in the particulars, and were always in the same story, which confirmed very much the truth of what they said.|$|R
5000|$|Marr {{recorded}} the song with bandmates Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce that July at London's Jam Studios. They recall the session as being accompanied by heavy marijuana use. [...] "We used to smoke dope from when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed to when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back to bed," [...] recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: [...] "You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your ears." [...] Joyce said the band even replaced the studio's light bulbs with red ones for ambience.|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't {{say what}} became o' him," [...] said the sailor from the Yorktown. [...] "You see, after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swamp, we {{determined}} {{to stick to}} the high ground until we found a regular trail leading to the south. Well, our walk took us up to a high cliff overlooking a gorge filled with trees and bushes. We were walking ahead, with Larry at our heels, as we thought, when Boxer chanced to look around, and the boy was gone." ...|$|E
60|$|At length <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, {{and some}} of us into the trap, when--judgment of Heaven!--here came Mr. Guele from his vineyard. So another quarter of an hour went by; till at length, at our earnest pleading, we set forth again in earnest, Fanny and I white- faced and silent, but the Jews still smiling. The heart fails me. There was yet another stoppage! And we drove at last into Calistoga past two in the afternoon, Fanny and I having breakfasted at six in the morning, eight mortal hours before. We were a pallid couple; but still the Jews were smiling.|$|E
60|$|Just {{as we had}} {{finished}} talking about skeletons and were drifting into the subject of fossils, Harris and I heard a shout, and glanced up the steep hillside. We saw men and women standing away up there looking frightened, {{and there was a}} bulky object tumbling and floundering down the steep slope toward us. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, and when the object landed in the road it proved to be a boy. He had tripped and fallen, and there was nothing for him to do but trust to luck and take what might come.|$|E
6000|$|We went {{on without}} saying more. [...] "Well, that's not Colonel Clay, anyhow," [...] I said, as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> earshot. [...] "For he accosted us first; {{and you may}} {{remember}} it's one of the Colonel's most marked peculiarities that, like the model child, he never speaks till he's spoken to--never begins an acquaintance. He always waits till we make the first advance; he doesn't go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his way to cheat us; he loiters about till we ask him to do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "First I {{threw an}} <b>out</b> and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds. (Receiver) Jonathan Taylor got hurt {{and so he}} had to come out. Another {{receiver}} came in and we did just a regular ol' route. We didn't do nothing special, but they all jumped the out route and left the fly on the outside wide open. I just threw it to (Vorheese Zanders) in between the safety and corner and he made a big play. He made one guy miss, another guy fell down, and he scored." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I remimber her?" [...] {{said the}} Ensign. [...] "Do I remimber whisky? Sure I do, and the snivelling sneak her husband, and the stout old lady her mother-in-law, and the dirty one-eyed ruffian who sold me the parson's hat {{that had so}} nearly brought me into trouble. Oh {{but it was a}} rare rise <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them chaps, and the old landlady that's hanged too!" [...] And here both Ensign Macshane and Major Brock, or Wood, grinned, and showed much satisfaction.|$|R
