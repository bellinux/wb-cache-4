5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Henrik {{is married}} to Johanna Sedin; they have two sons: Valter, {{who was born in}} 2006 in Vancouver and Harry, who was born on 12 May 2010. They live {{together}} in the city's Yaletown neighbourhood, and return to Sweden during the off-season. In March 2010, Henrik and Johanna made a joint $1.5million donation, with Daniel and his wife Marinette, to the BC Children's Hospital's $200 million project for a new building; the two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area. Henrik commented that it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> and his wife had wanted to do since Valter was born.|$|E
5|$|Hope, Powell, and Monk were {{considered}} by their contemporaries to be influences {{on each other}} early in their careers, and all, therefore, helped affect the development of jazz piano. Powell was known for horn-like right-hand playing supported by simple left-hand chords, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had worked on with Hope. Later pianists who have cited Hope as a major influence include Lafayette Gilchrist, Alexander Hawkins, Frank Hewitt, and Hasaan Ibn Ali. Hawkins said in 2013 that Hope was important {{because he had a}} highly individual style but does not have the iconic status of pianists such as Monk. Modern jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel has mentioned Hope's rhythms, phrasing, and compositions as influences.|$|E

5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E
5|$|Luna, Ron, Ginny, and Neville {{join them}} in the forest and all six fly to the Ministry on thestrals, expecting to find and rescue Sirius. Once in the Department of Mysteries, Harry realises that his vision was falsely planted by Voldemort; however, he finds a glass sphere that bears his and the Dark Lord's names. Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy attack in order to capture the sphere, which is a {{recording}} of a prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort, which is revealed to be the object Voldemort {{has been trying to}} obtain for the whole year, the Dark Lord believing that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> missed when he first heard the prophecy. Lucius explains that only the subjects of the prophecies, in this case Harry or Voldemort, can safely remove them from the shelves. During a heated fight Neville accidentally kicks and smashes the prophecy. Harry and his friends, soon joined by members of the Order, enter a battle with the Death Eaters, during which Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius and Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him and climatically fights the Dark Lord to a stalemate. In the midst of the duel, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to possess Harry in an attempt to get Dumbledore to kill the boy, then escapes just as Cornelius Fudge appears, finally faced with first-hand evidence that Voldemort has truly returned.|$|E

His second season at Botafogo saw him make twenty-six appearance and scoring once against São Paulo on 11 September 2014, which Botafogo lost 4–2.

After his move to Japan, Bahia made a farewell speech to Botafogo's supporters and felt moving abroad <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> can't turn down.|$|E
25|$|Telephone records {{revealed}} Dupas {{had made}} three prior telephone calls to Patterson {{to arrange a}} counselling session to treat depression and a gambling addiction, the first from a public telephone booth approximately six weeks before her murder. Over {{the course of the}} next six weeks, Dupas made calls to Patterson in an attempt to establish her vulnerability. Dupas later told police he cancelled his appointment with Patterson after being told by her his problem <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> was able to work through of his own accord.|$|E

5000|$|Critics praised Ivan Bunin's traveler's sketches, {{seeing them}} as an {{integral}} and highly important part of his legacy. Bunin's [...] "longing for the ceaseless, unrelenting wandering" [...] and his [...] "insatiable perceptiveness" [...] (as he himself put it, in the foreword to The Scream, 1921 Paris compilation) <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> long obsessed with. Later scholars saw {{it as part of}} his artistic philosophy, aiming at [...] "the understanding of all times and peoples' tribulations." [...] In his [...] "Liberation of Tolstoy" [...] essay Bunin wrote about some artists' ability to [...] "feel other times... better than that of their own" [...] and, critics argued, this [...] "transformational" [...] quality <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> made very much of his own.|$|R
25|$|Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally {{the toughest}} English side I played against, and the {{experience}} of playing against them first up in my Test career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not for the faint of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E
25|$|Meyer {{was very}} up front {{throughout}} his life about being too selfish {{to be a father}} or even a caring partner or husband. Yet he is also said to have been very generous with all his friends and acquaintances, and never isolated friends from one another. Biographers have attributed most of his brutish and eccentric nature {{to the fact that he}} was abandoned by his father, an Oakland police officer and overly coddled by his mother, Lydia, who was married six times. Meyer had a half sister, Lucinda, who was diagnosed in her 20s with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to California State mental institutions until her death in 1999. Mental illness ran in his family and <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> secretly feared. During his entire life Russ Meyer spoke with only the highest reverence for his mother and sister.|$|E
25|$|On the December 11, 1995 {{episode of}} Monday Nitro, Orndorff confronted Brian Pillman after Pillman made {{derogatory}} comments about Orndorff. After telling Flair and Anderson {{how much he}} respected them, Orndorff told Pillman {{that he could have}} been a Horseman and the only reason Pillman was a Horseman was because he turned it down. Anderson and Flair tried to calm Orndorff down but Orndorff lost his temper and attacked Pillman. Pillman, Flair, and Anderson attacked Orndorff and then Arn Anderson and Ric Flair delivered a spike piledriver to Orndorff on the arena floor during the attack. WCW later explained that Orndorff had been seriously hurt in the attack and that his career was over. In actuality, Orndorff was forced to retire due to his previous injuries in the WWF, with the entire right side of his body beginning to atrophy (eventually causing his arm and leg muscles to shrink). It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had worked through as best he could {{but by the end of}} 1995 he was forced to retire and started to work as a trainer and a road agent for WCW. At the 2000 Fall Brawl, in a match between The Filthy Animals and The Natural Born Thrillers, Orndorff suffered a neck injury after delivering a piledriver. The referee, Charles Robinson stopped the match as a result.|$|E

500|$|Few viewers {{picked up}} on the notion that the events of this episode were not {{necessarily}} factual. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said [...] "In the closing scene Frohike tells Mulder and Scully that the whole story <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> read in a crummy magazine. A lot of people didn't pick up on that subtlety. They thought that this was indeed the factual history of the CSM. As far as I'm concerned, it's not. Some of it may indeed be true, and some of it may— well, never mind".|$|E
500|$|The episode's ending was unusual, as many {{episodes of}} South Park tend {{to resolve the}} episode's events; in [...] "Fatbeard", the main {{characters}} don't return home and are shown at the end still in Somalia. An alternate ending {{made it to the}} animatic stage, in which Cartman, in a self-referential manner, congratulates the show on the conclusion of the season and invites the season's celebrity parodies (among those the Jonas Brothers and Kanye West). The ending, which Parker likened to that of a variety show, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> felt was funny in writing but didn't succeed visually.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driver's license. The [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] idea appealed to Appel because it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> [...] "lost the right" [...] {{to do when he}} went from public school to private school as a child. Appel {{considered}} those days to be his favorites because he [...] "didn't have to do anything" [...] at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.|$|E
500|$|Akira Ishida voiced {{the protagonist}} in this Japanese adaptation. He noted {{that since he}} was {{presented}} with the roles of both Pharos and the protagonist, recording {{the scene of the}} protagonist's initial meeting with Pharos <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed. In the English version of Persona 3 the role of both the protagonist and Ryoji is taken by Yuri Lowenthal. As with his previous role as protagonist of the [...] games, Lowenthal did not have extensive dialogue lines. His main task was shouting out the names of Personas: localization editor Yu Namba was initially worried about his performance, but Lowenthal managed to pronounce the names correctly. He attributed this to his love for Dungeons & Dragons.|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, {{a list of}} 116 alleged MI6 agents {{was sent}} to the LaRouche movement's {{publication}} Executive Intelligence Review, a weekly magazine which published it online.

MI6 biographer Stephen Dorril explained that most of the names were [...] "light-cover" [...] sources who worked out of embassies or missions posing as diplomats. Dorril argued, [...] "it is well known that rival intelligence networks know who these people are and accept them." [...] MI6 claimed that Tomlinson had originated the list, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had previously threatened to do, although he denied responsibility for it, and MI6 were unable to substantiate their accusation.|$|E
