The opening titles of Harry Worth {{featured}} Worth stopping in the street to perform an optical trick involving a shop window: raising one arm and one leg which were reflected in the window, thus giving the impression of levitation.

The shop <b>window</b> <b>sequence</b> first used in Here's Harry was filmed at St Ann's Square, Manchester, at Hector Powes tailor's shop, which is now a Starbucks coffee shop.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} an improvement to the multiple window (MW) spectrogram. The improvement was observed when redefining the MW spectrogram in a quadratic time– frequency distribution framework. This alternate view permits the MW method {{to be interpreted}} as an application of a single ambiguity domain filter, that consists of the average of each <b>window</b> <b>sequence,</b> to the ambiguity representation of the signal. In addition, the MW spectrogram can be improved by extending the ambiguity domain filter along the Doppler lag () axis. This enhanced MW spectrogram has lower variance and bias when estimating several signals {{in the presence of}} additive white Gaussian noise, while retaining the desirable properties of the spectrogram such as realness, non–negativity and minimal cross–terms...|$|E
40|$|Manifold {{structures}} of the Lorenz system with sets of non-classical param-eter values are investigated in terms of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the attractor. It is found that the structures are determined approximately by many unstable periodic orbits embedded in the attractor. Furthermore, an an-gle between a stable manifold and an unstable manifold of an unstable periodic orbit, which is measured by using covariant Lyapunov vectors, characterizes a parameter at which a periodic window related to the unstable periodic orbit emerges. In particular, when an unstable periodic orbit at some parameter has low angle (high angle) between a stable manifold and an unstable mani-fold, the periodic window corresponding to the unstable periodic orbit exists near (away from) the parameter. Due to this fact, the <b>window</b> <b>sequence</b> in a parameter space is almost determined from the information at a parameter, even if a window is quite small. ...|$|E

Antibodies are suitable as reagents, but generation of antibodies with low cross-reactivity to other human proteins requires careful selection of antigens. Here we show the results from a proteome-wide effort to map linear epitopes based on uniqueness relative to the entire human proteome. The analysis was based on a sliding <b>window</b> <b>sequence</b> similarity search using short windows (8, 10, and 12 amino acid residues). A comparison of exact string matching (Hamming distance) and a heuristic method (BLAST) was performed, showing that the heuristic method combined with a grid strategy allows for whole proteome analysis with high accuracy and feasible run times. The analysis shows {{that it is possible to}} find unique antigens for a majority of the human proteins, with relatively strict rules involving low sequence identity of the possible linear epitopes.

30|$|The {{first and}} main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is introducing the exponential reproducing windows into Gabor sampling scheme and reducing the time domain modulation functions, constructed by appropriately weighted <b>window</b> <b>sequences,</b> to simple exponential functions. The time domain modulation functions of this study can avoid holding complicated function structures and intricate system functions, which are difficult to realize in real world. Any time domain response function from E-spline system could be defined as exponential reproducing function, the simplest one being E-spline itself [18]. Interestingly, with appropriate weighting coefficients, the exponential reproducing <b>window</b> <b>sequences</b> can be synthesized to a simple exponential function. It could be viewed as the impulse response representation of an exponential filter, which can be carried out with simple passive electric circuit [19, 20]. For this study, we deduced the representation of the filter form of the time domain modulation functions in Gabor sampling scheme and chose the appropriate E-spline parameter vector α for guaranteeing the window positive real functions. Then, we constructed the measurement matrix for CS recovery and calculated each entry and proved that such measurement matrix has better coherence than that of DFT matrix. Hence, the measurement matrix satisfies the RIP, making it possible to recover the sparse Gabor coefficient matrix perfectly.|$|R

Many TIS prediction programs {{have been developed for}} optimal context, but they fail to successfully predict the start codon if the contexts conditions are in weak positions. The objectives of this paper are to develop useful algorithms and to build a new classification model for the case study. The first approach of neural network includes training on algorithms of Resilient Backpropagation, Scaled Conjugate Gradient Backpropagation and Levenberg-Marquardt. The outputs are used in comparison with Bayesian Neural Network for efficiency comparison. The results showed that Resilient Backpropagation have the consistency in all measurement but performs less in accuracy. In second approach, the Bayesian Classifier_ 01 outperforms the Resilient Backpropagation by successfully increasing the overall prediction accuracy by 16. 0 %.

40|$|The fixed-length {{sliding window}} {{approach}} {{is widely used}} in video search applications.

To ad-dress this problem, we present a novel matching scheme, which estimates an appropriate window length and threshold for each matching by inferring the context of the query and the current window. Moreover, to make the matching more efficient, we adopt a coarse-to-fine strat-egy which utilizes the compact min-hashing signature for fast filtering and robust spatio-temporal analysis for de-tailed verification. Substantial experiments show that the proposed video matching framework yields the robust accuracy and efficient computation for handling every type of video transformation...|$|R

Thus, it becomes {{increasingly difficult to}} determine the origin of a virus using only {{this part of the}} genome. During outbreaks in Europe and Africa, we found MV strains with identical NP-HVR sequences. However, these strains showed considerable diversity within a larger <b>sequencing</b> <b>window</b> based on concatenated MV phosphoprotein and hemagglutinin genes (P/H pseudogenes). In Belarus, Germany, Russia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the P/H pseudogenes provided insights into chains of transmission, whereas identical NP-HVR provided none. In Russia, for instance, the P/H pseudogene identified temporal clusters rather than geographical clusters, demonstrating the circulation and importation of independent variants rather than large local outbreaks lasting for several years, as suggested by NP-HVR. Thus, by extending the <b>sequencing</b> <b>window</b> for molecular epidemiology, a more refined picture of MV circulation was obtained with more clearly defined links between outbreaks and transmission chains. Our results also suggested that in contrast to the P gene, the H gene acquired fixed substitutions that continued to be found in subsequent outbreaks, possibly with consequences for its antigenicity.
