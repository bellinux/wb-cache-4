More than two-thirds of the empire's Asian army eventually aligned with Thomas, while the defection of the provincial tax officials provided him with much-needed revenue.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.|$|E

5|$|In July 1877, {{a violent}} {{railroad}} strike began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, sparking riots in other American cities, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes authorized {{the use of}} the military to put down the rioting. During the crisis, Tilley was temporarily transferred to , sailing up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C. Military leaders feared that rioters from Baltimore could travel to Washington to seize or damage vulnerable government targets. The troops defending Washington, including army, navy, and marines, were organized into a battalion of seven companies (Naval Brigade) under the command of Captain Edward Barrett; Tilley was placed in command of Company C. The precautions proved to be unnecessary, as the expected wave of rioters never materialized following the military's suppression of the strikers in Baltimore. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> the riots in other cities were also quashed.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b> This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E

5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} {{mothers with}} young cubs, are highly vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large carnivores who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to sturdier carnivores such as lions, leopards, spotted and brown hyenas, and wild dogs. Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b> In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped not just with those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other carnivores, such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|E

The district of Balsall Heath, which had originally constituted the most northerly {{part of the}} Parish of King's Norton, was the first area of the county {{to be added to}} the newly designated City of Birmingham on 1 October 1891. This was followed by the small island of Edvin Loach near Bromyard, which was transferred to Herefordshire in 1893. Two years following the loss of Edvin Loach, the county gained the parish of Upper Arley, which was a Staffordshire parish nearly surrounded by Worcestershire and Shropshire (See Fig 2). Oldberrow parish, which was situated in the north east Worcestershire border area was transferred to Warwickshire County Council jurisdiction during 1896.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{inability}} to subdue Krujë, Mehmed decided that the Ottoman presence would not depart from Albania. He organized a timar in eastern Albania to weaken Skanderbeg's domains. The new Ottoman possessions were collected and placed under {{the administration of the}} Sanjak of Dibra. He also decided to build a powerful fortress in central Albania to counterbalance Krujë's position and to form a base for further Ottoman campaigns. The fortress would be called Ilbasan (Elbasan). According to Ottoman chronicler Kemal Pashazade, the sultan would place several hundred men to patrol the area and defend the fortress. The foundations were built upon a field called Jundi, located in a Shkumbin valley, where the geographic conditions were regarded as favorable. Since the resources had been gathered and stored beforehand, Elbasan was built <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> (one month) and Franz Babinger believes the work to have begun in July. Critobulus, who accompanied Mehmed in this campaign, describes that the men stationed in Elbasan would constantly harass the Albanians, to leave them no place for refuge, and to repel any Albanian force which descended from the mountains. Due to his personal guidance, Mehmed was able to see the construction finish before the summer ended. There would also be inhabitants inside to serve the 400 soldiers stationed there along with cannons and catapults; the fortress would be under the command of Ballaban Badera.|$|E

5|$|Following the battle, John {{accompanied}} the Nicaeans in their rapid {{occupation of the}} Epirote domains, but he quickly became alienated from them. He brought his own followers to Vonitsa, from where he contacted his father, who had taken refuge in the Ionian Islands. Michael accepted his son's apologies, and soon joined him on the mainland. Byzantine control over Epirus {{had not yet been}} consolidated, and father and son were quickly able to recapture the Epirote capital of Arta and then relieve the besieged city of Ioannina. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> the Nicaeans had been evicted from Epirus. John's half-brother Nikephoros was then sent in spring 1260 to recover Thessaly, which he mostly accomplished after defeating and capturing the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos. Part of eastern Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, remained in Nicaean hands for several years thereafter. Again, despite his association with Thessaly, John is not mentioned as playing a role in these events or in the administration of the Thessalian territories in the early 1260s, which seem rather to have been under the control of Nikephoros.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Michael Crossley {{was back}} in action with No. 32 Squadron. With No. 501, Crossley's units {{attempted}} to engage KG 2 while over Herne Bay. The 15-strong Hurricanes were blocked by escorting Bf 109s. No. 501 came under attack from II./JG 51. One was shot down and its pilot, George E.B. Stoney was killed. His victor was Hauptmann Josef Foezoe, an Austrian pilot. No. 501 quickly counter-attacked, destroying two Bf 109s. One of them was flown by Horst Tietzen, an ace with 20 victories and the fourth highest claimant in the Luftwaffe at that time. The other victim was Hans-Otto Lessing. Both German pilots were killed. Another Bf 109 fell to Peter Brothers. The Bf 109s 22-year-old pilot, Gerhard Mueller was killed. Meanwhile, Crossley, Karol Pniak and Alan Ackford shared {{in the destruction of}} another Bf 109. The pilot, Walter Blume was severely injured and taken prisoner. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> the Germans turned the tables, and three Hurricanes (Crossley, Pilot Officer de Grunne and Pilot Officer Pearce) were shot down.

5|$|The {{plan was}} to stage uprisings <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> in {{southern}} and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea. Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in Kent started 10days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps {{to put down the}} insurrections. Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the River Severn. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October. Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to Wem, where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men. On 2 November 1483 he was executed. Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either Plymouth or Poole) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion. Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.|$|E

5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> Abu Ahmad was conferred an {{extensive}} governorate covering {{most of the}} lands still under caliphal authority: western Arabia, southern Iraq with Baghdad, and Fars. To denote his authority, he assumed an honorific name {{in the style of}} the caliphs, al-Muwaffaq bi-Allah. His power was further expanded in 875, when the Caliph included him in the line of succession after his own son, Ja'far al-Mufawwad, and divided the empire in two large spheres of government. The western provinces were given to al-Mufawwad, while al-Muwaffaq was given charge of the eastern ones; in practice, al-Muwaffaq continued to exercise control over the western provinces as well. With al-Mu'tamid largely confined to Samarra, al-Muwaffaq and his personal secretaries (Sulayman ibn Wahb, Sa'id ibn Makhlad, and Isma'il ibn Bulbul) ruled the Caliphate from Baghdad. What little autonomy al-Mu'tamid enjoyed was further curtailed after the death of the long-serving vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan in 877, when al-Muwaffaq assumed the right to appoint the Caliph's viziers himself. Al-Muwaffaq's personal secretary Sa'id ibn Makhlad was the outstanding figure in the Caliphate's bureaucracy until his own disgrace in 885, followed after by Isma'il ibn Bulbul, who served concurrently as vizier to both brothers.|$|E
5|$|Around 1550 the {{mounting}} conflict {{seems to have}} reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader's marriage to a local woman. Historical texts tie the lineage of the family's leader, Zafikazimambobe, to Anteony noble Ramarohala, who had settled there at least three generations before. Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual, and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles. Rather, these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means, and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro {{of the importance of}} local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them. Upon rising to power, the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ombiasy (wise men) who practiced astrology and served as scribes; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed. These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct sombily (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom. They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> after landing on the island.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s {{manufacturers}} such as Hummel and Adidas {{began to}} design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology {{led to the}} introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a stir in the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.|$|E
