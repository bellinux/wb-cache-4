5|$|Atheis was Mihardja's first novel; {{what few}} {{literary}} works {{he had written}} beforehand were mostly short stories and dramas, both those intended for the radio and the stage. He never formally studied writing, instead learning how to write fiction from his experiences reading existing works, including those of André Gide, Leo Tolstoy, Vsevolod Ivanov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. His writing style was heavily influenced by that of Gide, particularly as found in The Immoralist (1902). Malay, the language which forms the basis of modern Indonesian, was not Mihardja's native language; his earlier works had all been in Sundanese, and Mihardja had only begun regularly using Indonesian after the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> translator.|$|E

5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing.

Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> player–manager.|$|E
