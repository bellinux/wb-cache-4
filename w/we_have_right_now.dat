By {{the time of}} the release of the Green Album in 2001, a wave of {{mainstream}} emo bands including Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional and Motion City Soundtrack had cited it as a major influence. Cuomo was not comforted by this development, and told Rolling Stone in 2001: [...] "The most painful thing in my life these days is the cult around Pinkerton. It's just a sick album, sick in a diseased sort of way. It's such a source of anxiety because all the fans <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> have stuck around because of that album.

5000|$|General, I {{have the}} honor {{to report that}} the old owners of the lands on the Sea Islands, are making strong efforts to regain {{possession}} of them. These Islands were set apart for the colonization of the freedmen, by General Sherman's Special Field Order no. 15: Head Quarters Military Division of the Mississippi: In pursuance of this Order, which was issued as a military necessity, with the full approval and sanction of the Honorable Secretary of War, I, as you are already aware, have colonized some forty (40) thousand Freedmen, on forty (40) acre Tracts. promising them {{that they should have}} promissory titles to the same.I consider that the faith of the Government is solemnly pledged to these people, who have been faithful to it. and that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no <b>right</b> <b>now</b> to dispossess them of their lands.I believe that Congress will decide that Genl Sherman's Order has all the binding effects of a Statute, and that Mr. Stanton will sustain you in not giving up any of these lands to their late owners.I respectfully ask that this Order which I have carried out in good faith, Shall now be enforced, and that no part or parcel of the lands which have been disposed of under its just provisions, shall, under any circumstances, be restored to the former owners. It seems to me not as wise or prudent to do injustice to those who have always been loyal and true, in order to be lenient to those who have done their best to destroy the nation's life.|$|R

Anniversaries are happy affairs; among their many functions, they bring people {{together}} who share some common connection but represent different generations of contact with that common connection. The University of Twente, as our common connection, is not old as universities go, but as an institution it is certainly {{old enough to have}} old values, and old ways of going about its business. Today, I want to think about old and new. I want to reflect about the idea of "tele-learning " as something new at the University of Twente, and I want to speculate on what it might mean for our old values, our old ways of doing things at this university. And, because I am thinking in terms of an anniversary and of celebration, I want to use a metaphor that relates to celebrating: I want to frame my thoughts around the idea of wine: old and new, mature or still fermenting, I want to expand upon two apparently contradictory parables about wine, and draw messages from these for the University of Twente, telematics, and tele-learning. 2.

5000|$|Although forty-seven {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only forty-three could race. Gordon clinched the 55th pole position of his career, and his first since the 2005 Dodge/Save Mart 350, {{with a time of}} 23.053 seconds which was recorded near the session's conclusion. He was joined on the grid's front row by Riggs and had the pole position until Gordon's lap. Riggs missed a gear shift on his lap which meant he overreved his engine, and was required to change his car's power plant. Kenseth qualified third, Newman fourth and Nemechek fifth. Edwards, Reed Sorenson, Biffle, Martin and Kurt Busch rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Earnhardt, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified thirteenth, and Johnson, another driver in the Chase, started eighteenth. Yeley crashed on his first lap after leaving turn one, and his rear-end contacted the wall; he was checked at the infield care center, and later released to continue racing. The four drivers who failed to qualify were Morgan Shepherd, Kenny Wallace, Chad Blount and Donnie Neuenberger. After the qualifier Gordon said: [...] "It feels like my first pole ever. When it goes by for a while, you feel like you lost that magic touch or that combination that it took to get on poles.

5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{immediate}} response by {{what was supposed to}} be a rapid-response unit aroused significant criticism. Although the DART team was ready to leave within 24 hours of when the disaster struck, the government took two days to announce that the team would be dispatched, and it took nearly two weeks for DART to actually leave for Sri Lanka, due to a lack of available air transport. These delays notwithstanding, the DART chief, Michael Voith, commended DART's work, saying: [...] "What I can tell you after this mission is the organization of the DART that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> ... is a sound organization, it brings an incredible capability to a disaster area". John Watson of CARE Canada, responded by calling the operation an [...] "amateur" [...] response. Voith dismissed these remarks, saying that the team filled a [...] "critical void." [...] DART supporters have also noted that the initial response (i.e. digging people out of collapsed buildings, providing surgery/immediate serious trauma care for the injured), is not a DART responsibility. This is apparent from the fact that they do not have trauma surgeons, SAR assets, firefighters or other professionals who would be of critical importance during the very first days after a disaster. Rather, the job of DART is to mitigate the impact of the lack of critical infrastructure after a disaster.|$|E
