25|$|Torquay {{started the}} 2014–15 {{season in the}} National League poorly losing to Gateshead 1–3 with Ryan Bowman missing a penalty. After that match Torquay had a {{brilliant}} unbeaten run, first beating Welling United 3–0 then drawing 0–0 with Southport and then with Dartford. Yet another draw came when they drew with Aldershot Town 1–1 at home. That was their last draw for a while as they went on a six-game unbeaten run. Starting with a 1–3 away win at Lincoln City then playing at home beating Nuneaton Town 4–0, they were 3–0 up after 30 minutes. The Gulls {{then went on to}} win two away games winning 0–2 in both of them. First winning at Chester then Grimsby (manager Chris Hargreaves' home town). The next game was a home game that was looking to be a 0–0 draw until the 90th minute <b>when</b> <b>can</b> The Gulls captain Luke Young scored an incredible 35 yard free kick to give Torquay the 3 points. A 2–0 win at home against Dover followed, however this was {{to be the end of}} Torquay's 10 game unbeaten run and an indifferent run-in would see United end the season in 13th position.|$|E

2500|$|French and Saunders would {{eventually}} come to public attention {{as members of}} the informal comedy collective The Comic Strip, part of the alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s. They answered a 1980 advert in The Stage newspaper looking for female comedians to perform at The Comic Strip, which had, until that point, only had male performers. When they walked into the audition, they were immediately told, [...] "You're booked. <b>When</b> <b>can</b> you start?" ...|$|E

The idea is that {{attaching}} a k-handle [...] {{might create}} a hole that can be filled in by attaching a (k+1)-handle [...] This would imply that [...] and so the [...] entry in the matrix of [...] would be [...] However, when is this condition sufficient? That is, <b>when</b> <b>can</b> we geometrically cancel handles if this condition is true? The answer lies in carefully analyzing when the manifold remains simply-connected after removing the attaching and belt spheres in question, and finding an embedded disk using the Whitney trick. This analysis leads to the requirement that n {{must be at least}} 5. Moreover, during the proof one requires that the cobordism has no 0-,1-,n-, or (n+1)-handles which is obtained by the next technique.|$|E
2500|$|The great {{turning point}} in Callas's career {{occurred}} in Venice in 1949. She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in Die Walküre at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas {{that she would be}} singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing, he told her [...] "I guarantee that you can.". Michael Scott's words, [...] "the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Brünnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur". Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, [...] "We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano ... <b>When</b> <b>can</b> we expect a new edition of La traviata with [...] Gino Bechi's Violetta?" [...] After the performance, one critic wrote, [...] "Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras." [...] Franco Zeffirelli recalled, [...] "What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the enormity of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, {{who is one of the}} great coloratura sopranos of our time." ...|$|E
