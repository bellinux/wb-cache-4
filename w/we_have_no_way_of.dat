Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. For <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E

Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly {{one of the highlights of}} Themistocles's career. As Holland has it: [...] "What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for Themistocles' audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded." [...] His proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.|$|E

40|$|If two {{successive}} {{theories are}} semantically incommensurable, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> {{to make a}} complete comparison of their contents.

Thus, incommensurability creates a problem for the justification of the standard cumulative conception of scientific progress.;To resolve this problem, I distinguish irresolvable strong in commensurability from weak incommensurability, which is resolvable. I argue that Kuhn 2 ̆ 7 s arguments, insofar as they are sound, support only the latter. Cumulative progress is therefore not only possible, but in principle justifiable. Nonetheless, I support most of Kuhn 2 ̆ 7 s claims about the incommensurability of successive paradigms.;My argument for weak incommensurability depends on an interpretation of scientific theories which makes the way a theory is understood {{an integral part of the}} theory. Both syntactic and semantic approaches to theories fail to deal with the incommensurability problem because they ignore this pragmatic aspect. I offer a context-dependent semantics based on contemporary pragmatics which can both represent the incommensurability problem and show how it can be resolved...|$|R

50|$|A common tool in data {{forensics}} is {{the one-way}} cryptographic hash. This {{is a function}} that takes the data, and through a difficult-to-reverse procedure, produces a unique number called a hash. Hashes, which are often much shorter than the data, allow us to check if the data has been changed without having to wastefully store complete copies of the information: the hash for the current data can be compared with a past hash to determine if any changes have occurred.

From 1871 to 1903 approximately 3,000 pilgrims visited annually; and from 1908 to 1921, the number averaged over 8,000.

30|$|One of {{the reasons}} why the number of {{accidents}} is not decreasing is that the falling direction of a tree is unpredictable.

50|$|Arguably, Butler derives this {{rejection}} to postmodernism from misreadings of Cherríe Moraga’s work. “She reads Moraga’s {{statement that}} ‘the danger lies in ranking the oppressions’ {{to mean that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> adjudicating among different kinds of oppressions—that any attempt to casually relate or hierarchize the varieties of oppressions people suffer constitutes an imperializing, colonizing, or totalizing gesture that renders the effort invalid…thus, although Butler at first appears to have understood the critiques {{of women who have}} been historically precluded from occupying the position of the ‘subject’ of feminism, it becomes clear that their voices have been merely instrumental to her” (Moya, 790) Moya contends that because Butler feels that the varieties of oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, that they cannot be ranked at all; and takes a short-cut by throwing out the idea of not only postmodernism, but women in general.|$|E
