40|$|Taking a sociocultural {{perspective}} {{on a case}} study of <b>Web</b> 2. 0 <b>literacies</b> entails striving to understand the complexity of a specific domain of professional practice, taking into account historical, cultural and economic factors. In this longitudinal study of the work of a BBC cricket journalist, Jonathan Agnew, I explore how an overall commitment to ethnography led me to craft various methods of participant observation and analysis. Making critical use of a media ecology framework (Lum, 2005), and an understanding of technobiographies (Barton & Lee, 2013), I argue that an ethnographic approach to his use of Twitter, for example, requires investigations of texts and practices using other platforms and communications technologies (Gillen, in print). I demonstrate the fruitfulness of taking a flexible approach to fieldwork and show how I sought to integrate understandings of values, attitudes and practices towards <b>Web</b> 2. 0 <b>literacies</b> through investigating also his use of traditional media, such as book authoring and radio commentating, shaping and shaped by a distinctive media ecology. This methodology enabled me to explore some interesting changes in activities and practices providing support for Hine’s (2000 : 27) claim, “A style of ethnography that involves real-time engagement with the field site and multiple ways of interacting with informants has proved key in highlighting the processes through which online interaction comes to be socially meaningful to participants. ” Finally I discuss some of the difficulties and limitations of the approach...|$|R

40|$|This article {{raises the}} {{question}} of whether or not we can talk about such a thing as <b>web</b> <b>literacy</b> in general. Perspectives from media studies, literacy studies and the study of multimodal texts are used to find the main contextual parameters involved in what we might want to call <b>web</b> <b>literacy.</b> The parameters suggested are material conditions, domain, power or ideology and semiotic mode. These four factors, and their relevance for describing literacy on the web, are then further discussed by experiences from an empirical study of personal homepages. The results from this study are accounted for in terms of the literacy practices connected to the pages, the conceptions of textual norms among the users and in terms of the textual role played by writing in relation to other textual elements. In all these three aspects the personal homepage is highly heterogeneous. You find what might be call modern conceptions of texts as multimodal units, as well as more traditional writing. It is argued that <b>web</b> <b>literacy</b> should be understood as literacies, and furthermore as socially situated practices rather than technologically determined conventions of reading and writing. Thus, the parameter of domain (public-private, local-global, professional-“vernacular”) is of great importance...|$|E

40|$|Although many {{children}} are technically skilled in using the Web, their competences {{to use it in}} a critical and meaningful way are usually less well developed. In this article, we report on a multiple case study focusing on the possibilities and limitations of collaborative inquiry activities as an appropriate context to acquire <b>Web</b> <b>literacy</b> skills in primary education. Four 5 th grade school teachers and their students worked with collaborative inquiry activities on the subject of 'healthy food'. The project was aimed at both the development of <b>Web</b> <b>literacy</b> skills and content knowledge building. Data {{from a variety of sources}} were collected: videotaped and written lesson observations, interviews with teachers and students, teacher diaries, student questionnaires, and student assignments. The teachers appeared to be able to carry out the program to varying degrees. Contextual factors that influenced the realization of the project's goals and results were the adequacy of the research questions formulated by students, students' inquiry skills, and the teachers' teaching styles. Students' learning results show that it is possible to teach <b>Web</b> <b>literacy</b> skills in the context of collaborative inquiry activities. All classes show knowledge gain with regard to the subject healthy food and all classes but one show knowledge gain with regard to <b>Web</b> <b>literacy</b> skills. Although many students show adequate use of particular Web searching, reading and evaluating skills after the project, inconsistency, impulsiveness and impatience are also typical of their Web behaviour. In the context of collaborative inquiry activities teachers are challenged to deal with the paradox that they want their students to be active knowledge builders with help of the Web, whereas the Web seems to invite students to be more or less passive searchers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is similarly concerned with the challenge of identifying the determinants of success of online communities, but it explores the problem in terms of members' perceived professional development. A qualitative case study was adopted in this study to gather rich and naturalistic data. Online observation and interview data were gathered from three online communities: nurses, <b>web</b> developers and <b>literacy</b> educators. Results reveal seven determinants of success: a willingness to share knowledge, high-quality content, diversity of views, technology, relevant discussions, a respectful environment and rapid response to members' queries.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of World Wide Web (Web) use {{in higher education}} has stimulated a number of serious concerns about the potentially dubious nature of Web based data and information and students ’ ability to evaluate it. Lecturers are also uncertain {{about the value of}} the wider information resources on the Web and are concer ned about variable information quality and the possibilities of plagiarism. In the past, much effort has been directed to investigate various aspects of the Web use mainly focused on computer-mediated communications, configuration of the electronic resources and development of underlying infrastructure. However, little research has been done on the comprehensive assessment of the overall benefit or deficiency of the use of Web based information in teaching and learning. The author believes that the Web as a source of specific academic information has a great potential but the realisation of this potential requires considerable investment put into the Web structure design, <b>Web</b> <b>literacy</b> curricula and development of the <b>Web</b> <b>literacy</b> skills with a greater focus on a critical evaluation of the Web based information. The paper summarizes major concerns in the use of Web based data and information from a {{point of view of a}} final user and will be useful for researches and professionals working in the areas that contribute to the development of a knowledge- intensive and intelligent service Web in higher education as well as for teachers whose students use online recourses in a project or assignment...|$|E

The patterns indicate the different possible combinations of motivators or barriers that may exist in individuals. Data were gathered through online observations and semistructured interviews with 54 participants. The cross-case analysis shows that {{the most common type of}} knowledge shared across all three environments was practical knowledge. Overall, seven motivators were found.
