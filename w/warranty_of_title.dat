5000|$|As is is a {{legal term}} used to {{disclaim}} some implied warranties for an item being sold. Certain types of implied warranties must be specifically disclaimed, such as the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> [...] "As is" [...] denotes that the seller is selling, and the buyer is buying an item in whatever condition it presently exists, and that the buyer is accepting the item [...] "with all faults", whether or not immediately apparent. This is the classic [...] "buyer beware" [...] situation, where the careful buyer should {{take the time to}} examine the item before accepting it, or obtain expert advice.|$|E
50|$|In the {{transfer}} of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various warranties. The precise name and nature of these warranties differ by jurisdiction. Often, however, the basic differences between them {{is the degree to}} which the grantor warrants the title. The grantor may give a general <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. The latter type of deed is usually known as a special warranty deed. While a general warranty deed was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, special warranty deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions.|$|E
50|$|The {{suit was}} brought for breach of {{covenant}} of <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to a {{tract of land}} in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was defendant below. Its title was derived from grants of public land {{to aid in the}} construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount adverse title was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a breach of the warranty, and rendered judgment accordingly. This writ of error was brought to review that judgment.|$|E

40|$|The risk of {{intellectual}} property infringement claims poses an increasing threat to international trade. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is the most prevalent body of law governing international sales. Important questions will inevitably arise, therefore, under the CISG about {{the scope of the}} seller’s <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> Courts will be called upon to interpret Article 42 of the CISG, which provides a <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> governing third-party intellectual property claims, or the parties’ contract if they execute a customized <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> term. This Article analyzes the appropriate scope of the seller’s <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> against third party intellectual property claims under the CISG. It draws on the CISG’s legislative history, the CISG case law, the underlying policy of the <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> and an important German Supreme Court precedent in an analogous case to reject the “cloud on title” standard that has been applied in U. S. cases under the Uniform Commercial Code. This Article argues instead that, unless the parties’ contract clearly indicates otherwise, the seller under a CISG contract should only be held liable for third-party intellectual property claims against the buyer if (1) the buyer resells the goods in the seller’s jurisdiction and the claim arises under the intellectual property laws in the seller’s jurisdiction, (2) the buyer informed the seller about the third-party’s intellectual property rights prior to contracting, or (3) due to special circumstances, such as the seller having a branch in the jurisdiction under which the third-party’s intellectual property rights are created, the seller—but not the buyer—knew or should have known about the third-party’s intellectual property rights...|$|E

The practitioner should be aware of relatively recent federal legislation, the Magnuson-Moss Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, which will greatly expand the applicability of implied warranties. A full discussion of this federal law is beyond the scope of this article. In addition, the recent developments in the law of strict liability and products liability which complement and overlap warranty law are beyond the scope of this article...|$|E
