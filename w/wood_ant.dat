2500|$|In the ant lineage {{a unique}} {{antimicrobial}} thoracic gland, the metapleural gland, has evolved. Its acidic secretions have antibacterial and antifungal activity are deployed by ants {{to protect themselves}} (personal immunity) and other adults, {{as well as the}} vulnerable brood and nest substrate. It has been observed in leafcutter ants and weaver ants that broods raised by adults with nonfunctional antimicrobial glands are more susceptible to Metarhizium, furthermore nest material being tended by workers with nonfunctional antimicrobial glands was more likely to be overgrown with fungi. The Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus) fumigates its nest using naphthalene (known to humans as the main ingredient of traditional mothballs) and antiseptic agents to inhibit within-nest parasite growth and establishment, whilst the fecal pellets of the dampwood termite (Zootermopsis angusticollis) immediately decrease the rate of M. anisopliae spore germination when they are deposited in nest chambers and galleries. The <b>wood</b> <b>ant</b> (Formica paralugubris) incorporates solidified conifer resin into its nest (up to 7g of resin per litre of nest material), which inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi. [...] The terpenes in the conifer resin likely provide the antimicrobial activity, as they do in the antifungal secretions of soldier-caste Nasutitermes termites.|$|E

50|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour of <b>wood</b> <b>ants</b> changes {{according to}} the environment. <b>Wood</b> <b>ants</b> {{have been shown to}} tend and harvest aphids and prey on and compete with other predators for food resources. They tend to prey on the most plentiful members of the community whether they are in the canopies of trees or in the forest foliage. <b>Wood</b> <b>ants</b> seem to favour prey that lives in local canopies near their nest; however, when food resources dwindle, they seek other trees further from the nests and explore more trees instead of exploring the forest floor more thoroughly. This makes foraging for food significantly less efficient, {{but the rest of the}} nest does not help the foraging ants.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>ants</b> {{have shown}} {{aggressive}} behaviour towards their own species in certain situations. Intraspecific competition usually occurs {{early in the}} spring between workers of competing nests. This aggression {{may be linked to}} the protection of maintaining territory and trail. By observing skirmishes and trail formation of <b>wood</b> <b>ants,</b> the territory surrounding each nest differs between seasons. Permanent foraging trails are reinforced each season and if another ant from an alien species crossed it, hostile activity occurs. Most likely, the territory changes based on foraging patterns influenced by seasonal changes.|$|R

The beetle larva also feeds on ant larvae as well as smaller larvae of its own species. When fully developed, the beetle larva pupates in the ant colony.|$|E

5000|$|Formica rufa, {{also known}} as the red <b>wood</b> <b>ant,</b> {{southern}} <b>wood</b> <b>ant,</b> or horse ant, is a boreal member of the Formica rufa group of ants, and is the type species for that group. It is native to Europe and Anatolia but is also found in North America, in both coniferous and broad-leaf broken woodland and parkland. Workers are bicolored red and brownish-black, with a dorsal dark patch on the head and promensonotum, and are polymorphic, measuring 4.5-9 mm in length. [...] They have large mandibles and like many other ant species they are able to spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defence. Formic acid was first extracted in 1671 by the English naturalist John Ray by distilling a large number of crushed ants of this species.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>ants</b> {{typically}} have multiple nests {{so they can}} move around in case of drastic changes in the environment. This splitting of nests causes the creation of multiple daughter nests. Several reasons occur as to why <b>wood</b> <b>ants</b> move, such as a change in availability of food resources, attack by the population of another colony, or {{a change in the}} state of the nest itself. During this time, workers, queens, and the brood are transferred from the original nest to the daughter nest in a bilateral direction. The goal is to move to the daughter nest; but the transporting ants may bring an individual back to the original nest. The splitting process can last from a week to over a month.|$|R
50|$|Turnover rate of <b>wood</b> <b>ant</b> nests is very quick. Within {{a period}} of three years, Klimetzek counted 248 nests. Furthermore, no {{evidence}} of a correlation between nest age and mortality was found. Smaller nests had lower life expectancy compared to larger nests. The size of the nests increased as the nest aged.|$|E

5000|$|Formica is a genus of ants of {{the family}} Formicidae, {{commonly}} known as wood ants, mound ants, thatching ants, and field ants. Formica is the type genus of the Formicidae, and of the subfamily Formicinae. The type species of genus Formica is the European red <b>wood</b> <b>ant</b> Formica rufa. [...] Ants of this genus tend to be between 4 and 8 mm long.|$|E
50|$|Formica lugubris, {{also known}} as the hairy <b>wood</b> <b>ant</b> is common in the forests of the United Kingdom. Similar to other species of wood ants (genus Formica), Formica lugubris can be {{identified}} by a fringe of hairs that reaches down to their eyes. They can reach sizes of up to 12 mm long, and they live in massive colonies. Colonies consist of workers and queen ants, all of which are carnivores.|$|E
5000|$|The Formica rufa {{group is}} a subgeneric group within the genus Formica, first {{proposed}} by William Morton Wheeler. This group contains the mound-building species of Formica commonly termed [...] "wood ants" [...] or [...] "thatch-mound ants", which build prominent nests consisting of a mound of grass, litter, or conifer needles. [...] The species Formica rufa or the red <b>wood</b> <b>ant</b> is the type species of this sub group.|$|E
50|$|Hairy <b>wood</b> <b>ants</b> {{are found}} {{primarily}} in conifer and mixed conifer forests in Northern Europe {{and parts of}} Asia north of the Himalayan-Tibetan barrier.
