[...] In Boston, Coffman recalled that the newspaper headlines reported that [...] "the young upstart from the cotton fields of Alabama would pitch against the incomparable Lefty Grove." [...] On the day of his debut, Cochrane came into the clubhouse and announced that Eldon Auker would start the game. [...] Coffman complained to Cochrane, [...] "But Mickey you told me I would pitch today, and I'm prepared to do just that." [...] Cochrane responded, [...] "I don't care <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> [...] Go out there and bring somebody in like Schoolboy Rowe. Grove's pitching today and I want you to get off to a better start...you know we never score many runs off him."

[...] Coffman recalled that this was all Cochrane was waiting for, and he slammed his fist on a table and exclaimed, [...] "OK kid I'll catch you."

"I mean to {{tell you}} nothing but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> is, {{that it is a}} moral impossibility that any son or {{daughter}} of Adam can stand on this ground that I put my foot on, or on any ground that mortal treads, and gainsay the healthy tenure on which we hold our existence." ...|$|R
