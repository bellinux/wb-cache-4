5|$|Arrow Books also {{released}} a novelisation of the 1979 Quatermass serial, written by Kneale. This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail {{not included in}} the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new scenes to the producers of the television version, but by this stage it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> them to be incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Seward {{enjoyed his}} time in Georgia, where he was {{accepted}} as an adult {{for the first time}} in his life. He was treated hospitably, but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|Another command change {{occurred}} on June 22. In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant {{had to be}} concerned with Confederate forces in his rear under the command of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division {{in the vicinity of the}} Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson. Sherman would eventually pursue Johnston and (re)capture Jackson on July 17.|$|E
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views {{so that he could}} make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{commissioned}} into the fleet in July 1916 and March 1917, respectively. This <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> either ship {{to take part}} in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Bayern was assigned to the naval force that drove the Imperial Russian Navy from the Gulf of Riga during Operation Albion in October 1917, though the ship was severely damaged from a mine and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. Baden replaced Friedrich der Grosse as the flagship of the High Seas Fleet, but saw no combat. Both vessels were interned in Scapa Flow following the Armistice in November 1918. Bayern was successfully scuttled on 21 July 1919, but British guards managed to beach Baden to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. Sachsen and Württemberg, both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal in the early 1920s.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth {{approaching}} from the southeast, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> Leissègues to escape. Sailing {{with the wind}} westwards along the coast, Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron, which had split into two divisions. Although his divisions separated during the approach, Duckworth's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged {{the head of the}} French line, targeting the flagship Impérial. Under pressure, the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship. Severely damaged and surrounded, Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture. The remaining French ship of the line, Diomède, followed him. Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore, British boarding parties captured both vessels and set them on fire. The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships, which Duckworth's squadron had ignored; they eventually returned to France.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{detailed}} evacuation {{plans for}} some areas, the German authorities, including the Gauleiter of East Prussia, Erich Koch, delayed action until January 20, when it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> an orderly evacuation, {{and the civil}} services and Nazi Party were eventually overwhelmed by the numbers of those wishing to evacuate. Coupled with the panic caused by {{the speed of the}} Soviet advance, civilians {{caught in the middle of}} combat, and the bitter winter weather, many thousands of refugees died during the evacuation period. The Soviet forces took control of East Prussia in May 1945. A large part of the German civil population of about 2.5 million managed to evacuate, though about 25,000–30,000 were killed during the Soviet offensive. In May 1945 Soviet authorities registered 193,000 Germans in East Prussia but an estimated 800,000 returned after the end of hostilities, most of whom were later forcibly expelled by the Soviet and Polish authorities. The Polish census of 1950 indicated that 164,000 of the former German population remained in Southern East Prussia. Most later emigrated to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Farnese's attack {{achieved}} {{his goal}} of distracting the Dutch States forces from Maastricht. After the battle, the Spanish Army moved quickly to Turnhout, taking the castle of Grobbendonk on its way and appearing before Masstricht on 8 March, just six days after the battle of Borgerhout. François de la Noue followed the Spanish till Herentals with some troops, but {{when he realized that}} Farnese was to lay siege to Maastricht, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> him to reinforce the city's garrison. Moreover, mutinies and defections hampered the Dutch efforts to save the city. The English soldiers under John Norrey's orders, who remained out of Antwerp, kidnapped the abbot of St. Michael's Abbey in demand for back pays, and William of Orange's had to mediate to placate them. In political terms, the battle increased the Walloon defections from the States General to the Spanish party in the following months. Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing joined the Spanish Army with 5,000 Walloon troops of the Dutch States army and expelled from Menen a garrison loyal to the States General.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was {{responsible}} for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in breaking contact from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight its way down the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and {{would have had a}} hard time fighting their way back. Ultimately it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a standing patrol from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the capture of}} Junon, Guadeloupe was the only French colony in the Caribbean not under attack; Martinique fell to the British on 24 February and Spanish forces continued their Siege of Santo Domingo. The French did make further attempts to resupply the islands; a major expedition was defeated off Guadeloupe in April, and elements of this force that reached the island were defeated and captured during June and July. With British forces distracted by the ongoing Reconquista in Santo Domingo, {{the focus of the}} campaign moved north, and it was not until a second major expedition arrived in December that significant British forces returned to the Leeward Islands for the final invasion of Guadeloupe. The influx of British reinforcements <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> HMS Junon; on 13 December she had been cruising alone to the east of Antigua and been surprised by François Roquebert's squadron of four French frigates. Outnumbered and surrounded, Junon fought hard but was eventually forced to surrender after Captain John Shortland was mortally wounded. Reduced to a sinking condition in the engagement, Junon was set on fire and abandoned by Roquebert, whose ships were intercepted five days later off Guadeloupe and defeated: two were destroyed and two others returned to France without landing their supplies.|$|E

5|$|On 3 July 1992, Croatia was re-admitted to FIFA, playing {{its first}} {{official}} matches {{in the modern}} era against Australia in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. This team was led by Stanko Poklepović as part of an international exhibition tour; in April 1993, Vlatko Marković was appointed as manager. Croatia finally gained admission into UEFA in June 1993, which <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the national team to enter the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, as these already commenced the year before. Marković only led the team in one match, a home win against Ukraine in June 1993, before being dismissed in February 1994 and replaced by Miroslav Blažević the following month. The team's performances before Croatia's official independence were not recorded by FIFA, so they entered the World Rankings in 125th place. Blažević led Croatia's qualifying campaign for Euro 1996, beginning with the nation's first post-independence competitive victory, a 2–0 win over Estonia on 4 September 1994. Their first competitive defeat came on 11 June 1995 in a 1–0 away loss to Ukraine during the same qualifying campaign. They eventually finished first in their qualifying group and won FIFA's 1994 Best Mover of the Year award as they moved up to 62nd in the rankings {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
