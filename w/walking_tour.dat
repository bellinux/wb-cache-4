40|$|Sense {{of place}} has been deemed an {{important}} notion for planners {{as it is}} understood to have both economic and social benefits. However, profound social, economic, and cultural transformations have made {{it increasingly difficult to}} retain a sense of local place and its particularity. Losing this sense of particularity limits a places cultural and social capital – each of which are huge drivers of economic growth. As a response to this, guided <b>walking</b> <b>tours</b> – for example Jane’s Walks established in 2006 – have emerged as a form of cultural interpretation to help maintain and foster a meaningful sense of place. Despite a growing awareness of the benefits of guided <b>walking</b> <b>tours,</b> existing literature on how guided <b>walking</b> <b>tours</b> ought to be designed does not sufficiently address their complexity or understand their relationship to sense of place. This research attempts to fill this gap by analyzing how place is presented and experienced on the Tour Guys Downtown Toronto Tour. Using participant observation and interviews, this study suggests that guided <b>walking</b> <b>tours</b> have the potential to change the way people think and act by presenting them with distinctive place experiences. Therefore, guided <b>walking</b> <b>tours,</b> as they interact with sense of place, can be a powerful means for social and cultural transformation. Based on these findings, recommendations are made for effectively designing and using guided <b>walking</b> <b>tours</b> as tools for cultural interpretation...|$|R

5|$|Rakoto's {{opportunity}} for national fame arrived with the 1958 visit of French President Charles de Gaulle to Madagascar. The visit was {{in conjunction with}} the dissolution of colonial status and naming of Philibert Tsiranana as Prime Minister, part of the island's transition to full independence in 1960. Tsiranana had previously seen the flutist perform and invited Rakoto and his group of 18musicians to accompany de Gaulle and perform traditional pieces during a portion of the French statesman's <b>walking</b> <b>tour</b> through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this performance, Rakoto dedicated himself full-time to a career in music, performing regularly at traditional celebrations on the island. Tsiranana, who became president of Madagascar two years later, was the first to refer to the artist as Rakoto Frah, the name that the musician would use {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
