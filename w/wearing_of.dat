40|$|AIMS [...] The corneal {{epithelial}} permeability during extended <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> disposable {{contact lenses}} was {{compared with that}} during daily <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> soft contact lenses. The study was performed to verify whether the extended <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> disposable contact lenses {{would result in a}} higher permeability value than the daily <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> soft contact lenses. A higher permeability makes the cornea more vulnerable for bacterial infections and thus could explain the higher incidence of bacterial keratitis found in extended <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> disposable contact lenses in comparison with the daily <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> soft contact lenses. METHOD [...] The corneal epithelial permeability was determined by fluorophotometry in 33 healthy volunteers after the <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> soft, daily <b>wear</b> contact lenses for at least 6 months. Thereafter the determination was repeated in each volunteer after extended <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> disposable contact lenses for 1 month. The permeability in 34 healthy non-contact lens wearing volunteers was determined as a control. The permeability value was calculated from the amount of fluorescein that passed into the cornea after application by means of an eyebath. RESULTS [...] The mean permeability values after daily and extended wear were 0. 032 nm/s and 0. 031 nm/s, respectively. The values were not significantly different (Wilcoxon paired test p > 0. 5). The mean permeability for the non-contact lens wearing controls was 0. 042 nm/s. CONCLUSION [...] The results do not sustain the explanation that a difference in permeability value is the main cause of the increased incidence of keratitis during extended <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> disposable contact lenses in comparison with daily wear...|$|R

40|$|Environment-friendly non-copper coated {{solid wire}} {{is the main}} {{developing}} trend for gas shielded solid wires, whereas <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> contact tube limits their wide application. The effect of nano-modified coatings and welding process parameters on <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> contact tube for non-copper coated solid wires was reviewed.

40|$|Rubbers are {{interesting}} materials and are extensively {{used in many}} mining industries for material transportation. <b>Wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber {{is a very complex}} phenomenon to understand. The present study aims to explain the influence of rock properties on <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> M and SR grade rubber used in top cover of conveyor belts. Extensive laboratory experiments were conducted under four combinations of normal load and sliding speed. The <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> both the rubber types were analyzed based on the rock properties like shear strength, abrasivity index and fractal dimension. A fully instrumented testing set up was used to study the <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber samples under different operating conditions. In general, wear was higher for M grade rubber compared to SR grade rubber. Increase in shear strength of rocks depicts decreasing trend for the <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> M and SR grade rubber at lower load conditions. Moreover, a higher load combination displays no definite trend in both the rubbers. The strong correlation between the <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber and frictional power for all rubber-rock combinations has given rise to the parameter A, which reflects the relative compatibility between the rubber and rock. Increase of Cerchar’s Abrasivity Index of rocks shows gradual enhancement in wear for M grade rubber in all the load and speed combinations whereas, it fails in SR grade rubber due to its higher strength. The <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber tends to decrease marginally with the surface roughness of rocks at highest normal load and sliding speed in M grade rubber. However, the <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> M and SR grade rubber is influenced by the surface roughness of rocks...|$|R
40|$|Effect {{of laser}} {{quenching}} on <b>wear</b> and damage <b>of</b> heavy-haul wheel/rail materials WJ Wang, J Guo, QY Liu and MH Zhu In order {{to alleviate the}} <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> heavy-haul wheel/rail materials, the <b>wear</b> experiments <b>of</b> wheel/rail rollers undergoing laser quenching were carried out using rolling-sliding testing apparatus. The results indicate that laser quenching pro-duces a hard martensite layer with a certain depth. The improvement <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> resistance <b>of</b> materials resulting from laser quenching markedly decreases the <b>wear</b> volume <b>of</b> wheel/rail rollers. The maximal decrease rate <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> volume <b>of</b> wheel and rail materials is about 92. 9 % and 89. 5 %, respectively. Furthermore, the <b>worn</b> surfaces <b>of</b> wheel/rail rollers present different surface morphology and damage mechanisms due to difference of hardness matching. When the surface hardness of wheel/rail rollers undergoing laser quenching is high, the spalling damage and adhesion wear are dominating. When a single wheel or rail roller undergoes laser quenching, the damage mechanism of wheel and rail rollers are significantly different. According to the severe <b>wear</b> region <b>of</b> the heavy-haul wheel/rail, it is proposed that the rail side and wheel flange may undergo laser quenching treatment for alleviating <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> heavy-haul wheel/rail materials. However, further work should be carried out for clarifying the fatigue characteristic of wheel/rail with laser quenching...|$|R

5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions.

5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the <b>wearing</b> <b>of</b> Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
