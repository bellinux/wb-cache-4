In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

Stewart stated, [...] "I used to wear real fur, but, like many others, I {{had a change of}} heart <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> what actually happens to the animals".

2500|$|Not {{long after}} he {{resigned}} as minister, the Girondins came under attack and Roland was denounced as well. Roland fled Paris and went into hiding; in his absence, {{he was sentenced to}} death. Madame Roland remained in Paris and was arrested and executed. When Roland learned of his wife's death, he wandered away from his refuge in Rouen and wrote a few words expressing his horror at the Reign of Terror: [...] "From the moment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that they had murdered my wife, I would no longer remain in a world stained with enemies."

2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ... <b>learned</b> how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E

Grant was also reunited with Phil, Sharon and Kathy. Of his return, Kemp commented, [...] "When I was approached about returning to EastEnders for Barbara's final episodes, it was something I could not turn down. Barbara is a very close friend so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> of the storyline, it felt right that the Mitchell brothers are reunited with their mother for the last time.

2500|$|Some {{prospects}} who {{may have}} never had a serious look were given chances they thought they never would have. Undrafted journeyman Chris Minard had been signed with Alaska for his third season in the ECHL when the lockout allowed Davis Payne to assign him on the same line as Gomez at the Aces. Gomez saw a gem that led to the 2005 ECHL All-Star Game, and a top ECHL player that season; the pairing led to Gomez giving Minard a shot after the lockout ended, and he played his way into the AHL, and eventually signing a two-way contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins, receiving in 2007–08 his first call-up to the NHL. Minard said about the experience, [...] "That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> a lot about being a goal-scorer, playing with a guy like that who can pass the puck. It was a pretty cool experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, {{shortly before}} the end of his first year at the [...] in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he {{momentarily}} lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was his fault, indirectly.) A thought then came to him—"now you won't {{have to go to school}} anymore." [...] From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had epilepsy. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over Latin grammar. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, [...] "was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> what a neurosis is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later in January 2008, Clinton {{backed out}} of a cover photo shoot with Vogue over {{concerns}} by the Clinton camp that she would appear [...] "too feminine," [...] which prompted the magazine's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, to write, [...] "Imagine my amazement, then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that Hillary Clinton, our only female presidential hopeful, had decided {{to steer clear of}} our pages at this point in her campaign for fear of looking too feminine. The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying. How has our culture come to this? How is it that The Washington Post recoils from the slightest hint of cleavage on a senator? This is America, not Saudi Arabia. It's also 2008: Margaret Thatcher may have looked terrific in a blue power suit, but that was 20 years ago. I do think Americans have moved on from the power-suit mentality, which served as a bridge for a generation of women to reach boardrooms filled with men. Political campaigns that do not recognize this are making a serious misjudgment." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{designed}} a contest-winning poster titled [...] "Usefulness • Beauty • Health • Truth • Knowledge" [...] for the Girl Scouts in 1931. This contest {{was conducted by}} the Art Alliance of America, an organization that brought together craft workers and manufacturers. The six-judge panel consisted of W. T. Benda (who replaced Charles Dana Gibson), Ray Greenleaf, Rockwell Kent, John La Gatta, Neysa McMein and Edward A. Wilson. Martin's model for the poster was Barbara Smith, a 14-year-old from Darien, Connecticut (formerly Yonkers, N.Y). Her parents and Martin were longtime friends. He even served as best man at their wedding back in 1904. His winning entree earned him a first-place check, from the Girl Scouts' National Director Josephine Schain (pictured). This exchange took place right after the top three were announced, at their old national headquarters on Lexington Avenue in New York City. National President Mrs. Frederick (Birdsall Otis) Edey {{was one of three}} consultants, along with executives Mrs. Arthur O. (Anne Hyde) Choate and Mrs. Nicholas F. (Genevieve Garvan) Brady. This poster (pictured in insert) later appeared with three raised fingers instead of a salute, on the cover of Girl Scout Equipment catalogs for Fall 1932 and Spring 1933. It captured the spirit of their character-building movement, and was in popular usage until 1937. Martin said at the award ceremony, [...] "Barbara seems [...] the personification of all that Girl Scouting means. She is the very spirit of radiant, happy and wholesome young girlhood, and my mind naturally turned to her immediately <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> of the competition." ...|$|E
2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog {{got hit by}} a {{snowplow}} and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E
