Electrical blast is replaced by chemical blast (detonation of high explosive). The problem is solved using computational modeling utilizing the Finite Element Method (FEM) and LS-DYNA solver. After the introduction where detonation and shock wave propagation is explained the analytical approach is presented. This approach serves to results verification. In the next chapter is conducted research of applicable methods from which ALE method is chosen. In preliminary study is performed the mesh size analysis that is focused on finding the size of element which is both computational effective and gives accurate results. Next the infulence of input conditions (shape, location and parametres of high explosive, location of detonation point, boundary conditions) on distribution and time progress of pressure is investigated. Then influence of the opening on upper side of the case on overall pressure redistribution and strain and stress of the case is analysed. The stress-strain analysis of the case´s door which are connected to case by various types of contact models is performed as well as stiffness analysis {{of these types of}} contact...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{a numerical}} {{model of the}} heat dissipation processes in an electrical transformer dipped into polymerised resin. The transformer is cooled by both natural convection (via the ambient air) and forced convection (via the water cooling system attached {{to one of the}} <b>transformer</b> casing <b>walls).</b> Two cases have been compared, i. e. the cooler connected to the bottom or the top <b>wall</b> of the <b>transformer</b> container, respectively. In order to improve the modelling of the natural convection problem, an independent geometrical model of the surrounding air was created and considered separately. The continuity of temperature and heat flux along the interface between the transformer and air was enforced by an iterative procedure. This procedure allowed one to calculate and then prescribe local heat fluxes to the external <b>walls</b> of the <b>transformer.</b> The numerical results obtained in this project have yielded information on the efficiency of the analysed cooling system...|$|R
40|$|Transformer {{is one of}} {{the vital}} {{equipment}} to provide stable and reliable electricity to the community. The transformer is quiet while in operation, therefore it is hardly to realise if placed inside the building. The price for one transformer can be up to few millions Malaysian Ringgit. The worst of the transformer explosion may lead to the major blackout. Transformer explosion may due to, lack of maintenance or the problems inside itself whilst in operation. In the past at substation, the transformers were placed adjacent to each other and without a wall in between. Nowadays, installing <b>walls</b> between <b>transformers</b> have become in practice to protect other transformers in the events of explosion. In Malaysia, a reinforced blast wall is built as the protection. The finite element method (FEM) is employed for the simulation of the potential damage of reinforced blast wall. A FEM software is used due to the capability of analysing and simulating reinforced concrete structures subjected to high rate and short duration dynamic loading in the previous research works. The simulation results clearly reveal, after the impact load is applied, the cracks start to occur at certain time instants {{at the bottom of the}} <b>wall</b> on the <b>transformer</b> side. This follows later with the cracks on the other side at about one third of the wall height. The propagations of the crack then continue to move downwards in the curvy shape. The previous work and the field test provide indirect evidence that the structural behaviour and the cracks patterns are comprehended...|$|R
30|$|Similar {{with the}} {{monitoring}} result, {{it can be}} seen from the displacement curve, calculated using the transverse isotropic constitutive model, that there are two turnings points in this curve, which appear at the points, 15 and 41  m from the surface of downstream sidewall of the main power house, respectively. The depth of the splitting zone in the rock mass on upstream side <b>wall</b> of the <b>transformer</b> chamber is approximately 5  m. By comparison the displacement curve that is obtained using transverse isotropic constitutive model is very similar to the monitoring curve.|$|R
50|$|Later, when {{vacuum tube}} {{equipment}} {{began to be}} powered from <b>wall</b> power by <b>transformers</b> instead of batteries, the Fleming valve was developed into a rectifier to produce the DC plate (anode) voltage required by other vacuum tubes. Around 1914 Irving Langmuir at General Electric developed a high voltage version called the Kenotron which was used to power x-ray tubes. As a rectifier, the tube was used for high voltage applications but its high internal resistance made it inefficient in low voltage, high current applications. Until vacuum tube equipment was replaced by transistors in the 1970s, radios and televisions usually had one or more diode tubes.|$|R

40|$|We {{aimed to}} review the {{findings}} of exposure assessment studies done in European countries on the exposure {{of the general public}} to low frequency electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) of various frequencies. The study shows that outdoor average extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) in public areas in urban environments range between 0. 05 and 0. 2 µT in terms of flux densities, but stronger values (of the order of a few µT) may occur directly beneath high-voltage power lines, at the <b>walls</b> of <b>transformer</b> buildings, and at the boundary fences of substations. In the indoor environment, high values have been measured close to several domestic appliances (up to the mT range), some of which are held close to the body, e. g., hair dryers, electric shavers. Common sources of exposure to intermediate frequencies (IF) include induction cookers, compact fluorescent lamps, inductive charging systems for electric cars and security or anti-theft devices. No systematic measurement surveys or personal exposimetry data for the IF range have been carried out and only a few reports on measurements of EMFs around such devices are mentioned. According to the available European exposure assessment studies, three population exposure categories were classified by the authors regarding the possible future risk analysis. This classification should be considered a crucial advancement for exposure assessment, which is a mandatory step in any future health risk assessment of EMFs exposure...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Audio {{amplifier}} {{power supplies}} have typically utilized power transformers to provide safety isolation from a <b>wall</b> outlet. These <b>transformers</b> provide ohmic disconnect between the power supply and the AC mains. The power transformer and its inherent weight and expense can be eliminated by implementing an off line rectified system for high voltage {{portions of the}} amplifier. An optical isolator circuit {{has been designed to}} allow audio signals to pass while providing the isolation necessary to protect users from a wall outlet power source short circuit. The optical isolator used to pass the input signal in this design is a Fairchild 6 N 136 high speed opto-isolator. An identical opto-isolator has been employed to provide negative feedback for temperature stability and to maintain the operating point necessary to pass an audio signal. The circuit passes an input signal from the now optically isolated preamplifier stage to the power amplification stage with minimum distortion. The designed isolator does not exceed 1. 0 % total harmonic distortion, which is quite acceptable for high quality audio applications. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{detailed}} study on partial discharge (PD) generated in transformers using transient earth voltage (TEV) detection method. Experiment and numerical analysis are carried out using an iron box model which simulates a tank of an actual transformer. In the test model, propagation properties of TEV signal caused by PD occurring {{inside and outside of}} the transformer model are examined. Results reveal that the electromagnetic waves generated by PD in the model can leak from the opening window, having special frequency determined {{by the size of the}} opening window. It is also found that TEV sensor placed on the surface of the tank detects a TEV signal originating from the leaked electromagnetic wave. On the other hand, TEV signal by electromagnetic waves generated by an external PD source is found to have a wider frequency band than that by leaked electromagnetic wave. In addition, electromagnetic field and surface current analysis are performed using finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and simulated results are compared with experimental ones. As a result, it is shown that leaked electromagnetic wave excites a surface current on the outer tank <b>wall</b> of the <b>transformer</b> model. It is also found that there exists difference in the time required for TEV signal to arrive at the inside and outside sensors. The results indicate that PD emitting electromagnetic waves leaked from the dielectric discontinuities can be detected by the TEV method. Furthermore, these results suggest a combination of the detected waveform and its frequency band could lead to highly reliable diagnosis of the apparatus by TEV detection method.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, we propose and {{investigate}} {{a new approach}} to diagnose the effects of the various degradation mechanisms, including thermal degradation at hot spots, winding deformations due to the mechanical forces from short circuit currents, partial discharges due to local electric field surges, and increased moisture levels in the cellulose insulation due to decomposition, that affect electric power transformers during their normal operation in an electric power grid. Although the proposed diagnostics method can in principle be used to detect various degradation mechanisms mentioned above, we focus in the present thesis on mechanical deformations of transformer winding structures. Such mechanical deformations are most often caused by mechanical forces from short circuit currents, but they may also be caused by initial manufacturing errors and inconsistencies not detected by the power transformers’ suppliers quality assurance processes. We model a transformer winding surrounded by the transformer-tank wall and the magnetic core as a two-dimensional parallel plate waveguide or as a three-dimensional coaxial waveguide, where one metallic boundary (plate or cylinder) represents the <b>wall</b> of the <b>transformer</b> tank and the other metallic boundary (plate or cylinder) represents the iron core that conducts the magnetic flux. In between there is a set of parallel or coaxial conductors representing the winding segments. The new principle proposed in the present thesis is to insert a number of antennas into a transformer tank to radiate and measure microwave fields interacting with metallic structures and insulation. The responses from the emitted microwave radiation are expected to be sensitive to material properties that reflect the changes caused by any harmful deterioration processes mentioned above. Specifically, we investigate the mechanical deformations of transformer winding structures by determining the locations of the individual winding segments or turns, using measurements of the scattered fields {{at both ends of the}} winding structure. We solve the propagation problem using conventional waveguide theory, including mode-matching and cascading techniques. The inverse problem is solved using modified steepest-descent optimization methods. The optimization model is tested by comparing our calculated scattering data with synthetic measurement data generated by the commercial program HFSS. A good agreement is obtained between the calculated and measured positions of winding segments for a number of studied cases, which indicates that the diagnostics method proposed in the present thesis couldbe potentially useful as a basis for the design of a future commercial on-line winding monitoring device. However, further development of the theoretical analysis of a number of typical winding deformations, improvements of the optimization algorithms and a practical study with measurements on an actual power transformer structure are all needed to make an attempt to design a commercial winding monitoring device feasible.   QC 20131007 </p...|$|R
