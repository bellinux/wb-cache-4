25|$|Under careful {{management}} the woodland {{is slowly}} becoming enriched through natural regeneration. The northern areas are slowly returning to native oaks with a hornbeam and hawthorn understory, and a woodland ground flora that includes <b>wood</b> <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> and wood spurge; the whole being interspersed with naturalising exotic thorns and service trees {{to add a}} cross-cultural dimension. Meanwhile, the sandy brickearth soils that extend from Church Street along Dr Watts' Walk to the chapel lawns, the sole surviving heathland in Hackney, are returning to a lighter structure based on silver birch woodland and healthy species such as bracken fern. Today, a range of woodland birds, mammals and butterflies are supported; the grounds forming one of north London's largest breeding sites {{so close to the}} City for some very attractive species such as the speckled wood butterfly.|$|E

40|$|Purple <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> (Brachypodium distachyon) has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} model system for temperate grasses and is also a potential model plant to investigate plant interactions with economically important pathogens such as rust fungi. We determined the host status of five Brachypodium species to three isolates of Puccinia brachypodii, the prevalent rust species on Brachypodium sylvaticum in nature, and to one isolate each of three formae speciales of the stripe rust fungus P striiformis. Two P. striiformis isolates produced sporulating lesions, both in {{only one of the}} tested interactions, suggesting a marginal host status of B. distachyon. P brachypodii formed sporulating uredinia on the five Brachypodium species tested, and a range of reactions was observed. Surprisingly, the B. sylvaticum-derived rust isolates were more frequently pathogenic to B. distachyon than to their original host species. The B. distachyon diploid inbred lines, developed and distributed as reference material to the Brachypodium research community, include susceptible and resistant genotypes to at least three of the four P brachypodii isolates tested. This creates the opportunity to use B. distachyon/P. brachypodii as a model pathosystem. In one B. distachyon accession, heavy infection by the loose smut fungus Ustilogo bromivora occurred. That pathogen could also serve as a model pathogen of Brachyodium...|$|R

40|$|Included {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of the Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument are a number of noxious weeds for which the BLM mandates control. In addition to listed weeds are nonnative <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> [Bromus tectorum and Bromus rubens), which can potentially convert native ecosystems to biologically impoverished annual grasslands. Although <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> occur virtually throughout the new Monument, they remain at relatively low biomass, with denser stands patchily distributed in former disturbances due to agriculture, road development, and fire. We discuss case studies indicating that this type of distribution often precedes habitat conversion by <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and we review various investigations related to how and why coverage expands. Measures should be taken to monitor the spread of <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and management strategies related to road development, tourism, fire, grazing, and habitat alteration and restoration should be consistent with the need to contain the distributions and abundances of these destructive weeds...|$|R

40|$|Early {{detection}} of an invasive species facilitates control and eradication. Slender <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> (Brachypodium sylvaticum) was first {{discovered in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains of Central California in 2003 as a non-native grass in redwood forests, competing with native vegetation. The current infestation in the Santa Cruz Mountains, estimated to be 300 acres, is concentrated in San Mateo County and could be eradicated. This study sought to determine most likely locations of slender <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> in the Santa Cruz Mountains by assessing environmental attributes of known presence locations using species distribution modeling and Maxent software. The study used 1, 320 species presence points collected in field surveys conducted from 2009 to 2012, GIS environmental layers covering a 940 kmÂ² study area, and the machine-learning program Maxent to identify slender <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> habitat at a 30 m resolution in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Maxent models successfully identified locations of potential distribution of slender <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> (training AUC = 0. 961, test AUC = 0. 960). Annual precipitation, average annual maximum or minimum temperature, and soils {{were the most important}} predictors. An independent dataset corroborated the performance of the Maxent model. Maxent could be used by land managers for targeting field surveys by predicting most likely B. sylvaticum habitat in the Santa Cruz Mountains...|$|R

50|$|Brachypodium distachyon, {{commonly}} called purple <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> or stiff <b>brome,</b> is a <b>grass</b> species native to southern Europe, northern Africa and southwestern Asia east to India. It {{is related to}} the major cereal grain species wheat, barley, oats, maize, rice, rye, sorghum, and millet. It has many qualities that make it an excellent model organism for functional genomics research in temperate grasses, cereals, and dedicated biofuel crops such as switchgrass. These attributes include small genome (~270 Mbp) diploid accessions, a series of polyploid accessions, a small physical stature, self-fertility, a short lifecycle, simple growth requirements, and an efficient transformation system. The genome of Brachypodium distachyon (diploid inbred line Bd21) has been sequenced and published in Nature in 2010.|$|R

40|$|Fine fuels from non-native, annual <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> have {{overcome}} native plants {{across much of}} Zion Canyon in Zion National Park. This invasion threatens the single road that provides access intoâand escape fromâthe canyon, creating a threat to human life should a large wildfi re occur there. In addition, native riparian plant communities in Zion Canyon have been degraded by non-native plants, and recurrent fire caused by annual grasses could further reduce native plant diversity. Results from {{this study suggest that}} burning can have a more lasting effect than annual mowing in reducing fine fuel loads, extending the period between repeated maintenance treatments. When burning is coupled with fall herbicide application, added control can extend the maintenance interval even further through reduction of <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> density...|$|R
