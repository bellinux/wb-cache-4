Up until the 1980s, most of the material published relating to the loss of Sydney accepted the German interpretation of events (that Burnett was deceived by Kormorans disguise, and placed his ship in a tactically unsound position) and assigned Burnett various levels of blame {{for his role in the}} cruiser's demise.|$|E
25|$|While many {{theories}} on motivation have a mentalistic perspective, behaviorists {{focus only on}} observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence. In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about <b>what</b> <b>factors</b> cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored. Where others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or needs, {{that may not be}} observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.|$|E

Last records off west coast were in 1998 off Cape San Martin and Monterey. Afterwards, any records ceased until 2014. In Bonin Islands and off Oregon and California, constant occurrences were confirmed in the 1990s. <b>What</b> <b>factors</b> caused sudden rise in sighting trends in the 2010s and disappearance in the 2000s in many of former range especially for mid-lower latitudes are unknown.

Drug use in the first trimester is the most harmful to the fetus in terms of neurological and developmental outcome. The effects of PCE later in a child's life are poorly understood; there is little information about the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on children over age five. Some studies have found PCE-related differences in height and weight while others have not; these differences are generally gone or small by the time children are school age. Much is still not known about <b>what</b> <b>factors</b> may exist to aid children who were exposed to cocaine in utero. It is unknown if the effects of PCE are increased once children reach adolescence, or whether the neural rewiring that occurs during this developmental period attenuates the effects. A review of 27 studies performed between 2006 and 2012 found that cognitive development was mildly to moderately affected in PCE adolescents, but it was not clear how important these effects were in practical terms.|$|E

40|$|Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a {{decision}} making tool based on linear programming for measuring the relative efficiency {{of a set of}} comparable units. DEA helps us identify the sources and level of inefficiency for each of the inputs and outputs. This approach has been used to evaluate the efficiency of the safety department in five construction companies. A three-input, safety workforce, safety training, and safety budget, and two-output, Perfect days and Uptime, constant returns-to-scale (CRS) model was developed. The model indicated the necessary improvements required in the inefficient unit’s inputs and outputs to make it efficient, by identifying <b>what</b> <b>factor</b> is responsible for the low efficiency of performance, and also <b>what</b> <b>factor</b> should be improved in order to improve the efficiency of the safety department. The result shows that the safety department of firm A, B and D are efficient, but Firm C and Firm E can improve their efficiency by reducing inputs up to 3. 34 % and 6. 05 %, respectively. The inputs identified for reduction were; number of safety staffs and safety budget for Firm C and E respectively...|$|R
