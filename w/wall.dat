5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's Western <b>Wall</b> is a {{surviving}} <b>wall</b> of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest {{they enter the}} Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western <b>Wall,</b> which accordingly endows the <b>Wall</b> with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a western <b>wall</b> of the Temple itself, and since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western <b>Wall</b> of the Mount.|$|E

40|$|The flora of 650 <b>walls</b> in {{south-eastern}} Essex is analysed, {{with emphasis}} on the relative frequency of species on <b>walls</b> of different kinds. Comparisons are made with other surveys of wall-flora. AIM AI'D SCOPE OF THE SURVEY During the four years 1973 - 1976, I kept 650 <b>walls</b> and series of <b>walls</b> in south-eastern Essex under observation, with the primary aim of discovering the relative frequency of different species of flowering plants and ferns in such habitats. The area covered was that part of S. Essex, v. c. 18, roughly east of a line running south from Chelmsford through Billericay to Tilbury. Of the 650 <b>walls</b> surveyed, 278 (43 °' 0) were urban garden <b>walls</b> (or series of <b>walls),</b> 182 (28 %) were churchyard <b>walls,</b> 47 (7 ~ 0) railway <b>walls,</b> 41 (6 ~ 0) <b>walls</b> of secular buildings other than railway buildings, 44 (7 ~o) retaining <b>walls</b> (including some also in the other categories) and 79 (12 ° 0) <b>walls</b> in relatively rural areas (other than churchyard, railway and retaining <b>walls).</b> River and sea <b>walls</b> were wholly excluded.

50|$|In {{terms of}} construction, soil nail <b>walls</b> have a decisive {{advantage}} over other alternatives.

50|$|All post-Palaeozoic {{cyclostomes}} have interzooidal connections via pores in {{the vertical}} <b>walls</b> separating adjacent zooids. In the fixed-walled forms, these narrow pores constitute the only coelomic connection, because the vertical <b>walls</b> contact and fuse with the calcified, exterior frontal <b>walls.</b> However, in free-walled forms, the frontal <b>walls</b> are uncalcified, and no contact {{is made with}} the vertical <b>walls,</b> creating a wider coelomic connection around the distal ends of the vertical <b>walls.</b>|$|R

5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} <b>wall.</b> Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the <b>wall,</b> allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} <b>wall</b> without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a <b>wall</b> with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the <b>wall</b> in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|Demolitions began {{soon after}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Jacobite threat in 1746. The bastions of the Telfer <b>Wall</b> along Lauriston Place were demolished in 1762, as they were obstructing traffic. The Netherbow survived until 1764, when it too was removed as an obstruction. The West Port and the Potterow Port were removed in the 1780s. By now, the New Town was under construction, and although smuggling of goods through the city walls was still being punished, complaints about the zealousness of the guards were widely circulated. The Old College of the University of Edinburgh (constructed from 1789), and then the Royal Museum of Scotland (constructed from 1861), were built over sections of the <b>wall</b> around the Potterow Port. Forrest Road was laid out in the 1840s, resulting in the loss of another section of the Telfer <b>Wall.</b> During construction works around the Advocates' Library and Parliament House in 1832 and 1845, fragments of walling were uncovered, which were attributed to the King's <b>Wall.</b> Two sections of the increasingly neglected town <b>wall</b> collapsed in the mid-1850s. In 1854, a large portion of <b>wall</b> (20 feet high and 3–4 feet thick), and the embankment against which it was built fell into Leith Wynd between the High Street and Calton Road. A week later the Dean of Guild ordered the removal of a 150 feet stretch of the <b>wall</b> from that location. In 1856, a lightning strike appears to have been the cause of the collapse of a 40 to 50 feet stretch of the <b>wall</b> enclosing Greyfriars Kirkyard.|$|E
5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the <b>wall</b> by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the <b>wall.</b> The <b>wall</b> was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the <b>wall</b> themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
