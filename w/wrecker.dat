5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and wrecking {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. Although there was no interest in London it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York. A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary <b>wrecker</b> Cruel Coppinger, culminating in a fire at Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E

40|$|As debates raged {{about the}} parlous state of English opera {{in the first}} decades of the 20 th century, the {{composer}} Ethel Smyth saw her opera The <b>Wreckers</b> staged in London. After writing two operas directed towards the German market and in an idiom steeped in the German Romantic tradition, Smyth consciously re-focused her style for The <b>Wreckers,</b> exploring the possibilities of creating opera that might simultaneously find favour in England and appeal to theatres on the continent. This paper will consider The <b>Wreckers</b> as an essay in a cosmopolitan style, that simultaneously employed internationally recognised tropes of Englishness. Written between 1903 and 1905, The <b>Wreckers</b> speaks to Smyth’s interest both in French opera as exemplified by Bizet and Massenet and in elements of verismo. The <b>Wreckers</b> has largely been viewed in the context of English opera and this paper aims to re-situate Smyth’s most significant opera within her cosmopolitan milieu...|$|R
50|$|The Bahamian {{government}} eventually exerted {{control over}} the <b>wreckers.</b> The <b>wreckers</b> were required to carry salvaged goods to Nassau, where they were auctioned. However, goods useful on a ship or in a <b>wrecker's</b> home were often diverted with a blind eye turned by government officials. Increased shipping {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 led to more wrecks. Vessels specifically designed for wrecking were built in the Bahamas. A U.S law of 1825 required that all goods salvaged from wrecks in U.S. waters be taken to an American port of entry (which, for the Bahamians, meant Key West, Florida). Many Bahamian <b>wreckers</b> eventually moved to Key West and became U.S. citizens.|$|R

25|$|After {{three days}} in an NKVD prison, Krylenko confessed {{that he had been}} a <b>wrecker</b> since 1930. On April 3, he made an {{additional}} confession, explaining that he had been an enemy of Lenin's even before the 1917 revolution. At his last questioning on June 28, 1938, he confessed that he had recruited thirty Commissariat of Justice employees to his anti-Soviet organization.|$|E
50|$|After 1815, {{fishing boats}} from New England began visiting the Florida Keys {{in the winter}} to fish for the Havana market. These {{fishermen}} engaged in wrecking when the opportunity arose. With the acquisition of Florida by the United States in 1821 and the settlement of Key West in 1822, the New England fishermen-wreckers began moving their homes to Key West. Conflicts quickly developed with the Bahamian <b>wreckers.</b> U.S. Navy ships stopped and boarded Bahamian <b>wreckers</b> to check papers, and arrested two Bahamian captains on suspicion of smuggling slaves. American <b>wreckers</b> became increasingly hostile to Bahamian <b>wreckers,</b> and in 1825 the U.S. Congress passed a law requiring all goods salvaged in U.S. waters {{to be taken to}} an American port of entry. This measure created a great inconvenience for the Bahamian <b>wreckers,</b> as they had to take salvaged goods and ships to Key West before they could return home to the Bahamas. Some of them soon moved to Key West and acquired U.S. citizenship.|$|R
50|$|Dedicated {{to protect}} all {{innocent}} life in haunted {{memory of his}} own tragic past, Tap-Out became Glyph's bodyguard and a protector to the planet's humanoid inhabitants. Some 300 years later, {{he became aware of}} the arrival of Primal Prime's <b>Wreckers</b> when the naive CatSCAN wandered into a primitive camp. Attacking without bothering to answer questions, Tap-Out was thwarted by CatSCAN's initial non-harmful strike and then by the timely arrival of Primal Prime and the other <b>Wreckers.</b> Tap-Out apologized for his behavior, and presumably joined the <b>Wreckers</b> alongside Glyph after Cyclonus absconded with an alien energy source from the planet upon which he had crashed. When the <b>Wreckers</b> left Archa 9 they took Tap-Out with them, but left CatSCAN and Glyph on the planet.|$|R

25|$|The Diamond T 4-ton 6×6 {{truck was}} a heavy {{tactical}} truck built for the United States Army during World War II. Its G-number was (G-509). Cargo models were designed to transport a 4-ton (3,600kg) load over all terrain in all weather. There were also <b>wrecker,</b> dump, and other models. They were replaced by the M39 series 5-ton 6x6 trucks in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) is {{a family}} of vehicles, based on a common 5-axle ten-wheel drive 10x10 chassis, that vary in {{individual}} configuration by mission requirements. The LVSR was designed and is manufactured by Oshkosh Defense. LVSR is a purpose-designed military vehicle and there are currently three variants in service, a cargo, a <b>wrecker</b> and a tractor truck.|$|E
25|$|In 1939-1941 the Army Ordnance Corps was {{developing}} a complete line of tactical trucks that could operate over all roads and cross-country terrain in all weather. Corbitt, {{a small company}} which had sold the US Army trucks since 1917, was working on designs for heavy-duty conventional 6x6s trucks. In 1940 their designs for a 6-ton truck and a 10-ton <b>wrecker</b> chassis were standardized, with Corbitt to build 6-ton cargo trucks, while the 10-ton wreckers were contracted to Kenworth Motor Truck Corp. and Ward LaFrance Truck Corp. Ward LaFrance began production in 1941 and would build 4,925 vehicles. Kenworth began in 1942, but because of interruptions in manufacturing only built 840. At first the manufacturers' chassis were similar and used the same components. After the 1943 upgrade to -A1 standard, the two chassis were mechanically identical and parts were interchangeable. After the war, the rating of the 10-ton <b>wrecker</b> was lowered to 6-ton.|$|E
5000|$|According to narrated story, {{gangs of}} <b>wreckers</b> {{operated}} {{on the coast}} of Cornwall during early 19th century. Cornwall has been very aptly described as the [...] "haven of smugglers" [...] in view of its topographic features of [...] "rocky coves, sheltered bays, tumultuous waves and wild and untenanted landscapes". The <b>wreckers</b> ensnared ships to this coast line by tricking them with use of beacon lights, which they purposefully installed on the shores of the coast. Once the ships foundered on the rocky coast they were looted by the <b>wreckers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Developed for the Artillery Branch, {{the chassis}} also became the {{standard}} medium <b>wrecker</b> {{and was used}} by the Corps of Engineers for cargo, dump, and specialty bodies. A crane for chemical weapons and an extra long cargo version for Canada were also built. In addition to trucks built for Canada 2,245 were exported under the Lend-Lease Act, most to the British, French, and Canadians.|$|E
25|$|The first LVSR cargo variant began {{testing at}} the Aberdeen Proving Ground in June 2007. Tractor and <b>wrecker</b> {{prototype}} vehicles began testing in November 2007 and April 2008 respectively. An additional 123 cargo variants, which completed low rate initial production (LRIP) quantities, were subsequently ordered under option year {{two of the}} production contract. In January 2009, Oshkosh announced an LVSR delivery order valued at $176 million. This called for more than 425 LVSRs and transitioned LVSR from LRIP into full-rate production (FRP).|$|E
25|$|The armor {{system for}} LVSR follows the A-kit/B-kit principle, with {{vehicles}} designed 'fitted for, but not with', protection. In {{the case of}} LVSR, 'fitted for' includes an armored cab floor as standard. Cargo and <b>wrecker</b> variants require an upgrade of the front springs. Protection kits can be installed and uninstalled from vehicles in the field using only basic tools. The A-kit is fitted on the production line and is {{the combination of a}} limited amount of armoring (in difficult-to-access areas of the vehicle), together with a significant amount of armour installation attachments and required support structures. The bulk of the armor, the B-kit, is installed in the field on an 'as required' basis.|$|E
