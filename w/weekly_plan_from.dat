40|$|Arts {{education}} {{is an important}} element of the early years curriculum. Children first learn to express themselves through the arts (dance, drama, media, visual arts and music). Furthermore, numerous studies provide evidence that quality learning experiences in the arts contribute in significant ways to social success and impact positively on a child's academic achievement and long-term education. In Australia, early years teachers are expected to teach arts education. This study explored the <b>weekly</b> <b>planning</b> of 76 early years teachers across kindergartens, preparatory classes and Years 1, 2 and 3 in Queensland, Australia. Settings took a structured 'curriculum-focused' approach to learning in the early years, which made the exploration of planning important. Our study looked for segments of time devoted to music throughout the week. Content analysis was used to interpret the <b>weekly</b> <b>plans,</b> with three themes emerging: (1) The majority of the <b>weekly</b> <b>plans</b> were dedicated to literacy and numeracy; (2) Little time was devoted to the teaching of music apart from the scheduled 30 -minute music lesson with a specialist teacher in some schools; and (3) Of the limited number of <b>weekly</b> <b>plans</b> that featured music, activities were teacher-directed. These results provide insight to the current understanding and value of music education in the early years curriculum. Key messages can be drawn about the importance of professional development, music advocacy in the early years, and curriculum and policy planning.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a two-step bloodmobile {{collection}} planning framework. The {{first step is}} the annual planning to determine weeks of collection at each mobile site {{in order to ensure}} regional self-sufficiency of blood supply.

A new donation forecast model is proposed based on population demographics, donor generosity, and donor availability. A new concept of bloodmobile collection configurations is proposed for compact and efficient mathematical modeling of <b>weekly</b> <b>planning</b> in order to minimize the total working time.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the ever}} {{increasing}} competitive {{environment of the}} airline industry, efficient personnelâ€™s planning {{is among the most}} challenging tasks and solely responsible for the largest impact on an airlineâ€™s cost structure. The problem is theoretically appealing because it is computationally difficult due to the huge number of possibilities, and the amount of rules that determine crew planning. This work proposes a methodology to determine the most efficient and least costly way to serve the flights in an airline schedule during a <b>weekly</b> <b>planning</b> horizon considering layovers and deadheads. The strategy is composed of three optimization models: a binary programming model, a model based on the set partitioning problem, and a third model based on the set covering problem, the two latter solved via column generation. Computational results for the three models are presented using test instances built from a mid-sized Colombian airline...|$|R

40|$|Line-of-Balance is a {{graphical}} technique {{which can}} be used to plan and manage work flow. It is suit-able for construction projects because of their large degree of repetition. Despite its strengths Line-of-Balance has not gained widespread use in construction industry internationally. However, it has been used as the principal scheduling tool in Finland since 1980 s. As a result of two decades of research and use in industry, a comprehensive schedule planning and control system has been developed around lo-cation-based techniques. A computer software has facilitated implementation in construction companies. This paper describes a case study of 15, 000 m 2 office building project using location-based methods for schedule planning and control. Master schedule is based on Bill of Quantities where quantities have been calculated based on the project's Location Breakdown Structure. Before implementation, different schedule alternatives were evaluated based on risk of interference, total duration and cost. During construction, the master schedule sets constraints on lower level task schedules, which were used to ensure the continuity of work for crews on a more detailed level. The master schedule was not updated even when there were deviations <b>from</b> the original <b>plan.</b> Instead the task plans were updated {{to catch up with the}} original schedule. This prevented the problems from accumulating in downstream production. In this case study the combination of PPC measurement (calculating the percentage of weekly assignments complete) and task <b>planning</b> was piloted. <b>Weekly</b> <b>plans</b> were made by combining assignments from all the task schedules. If the starting constraints had not been removed the task plan was updated to assess the effect on total production and to plan control actions. PPC measurement was found to improve task plan reliability. Benefits of the approach included better schedule control and possibility to examine how deviations <b>from</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>plans</b> affected the total schedule. Task planning provides information about how long a master schedule task actually reserves a location. This information can be used in planning master schedules of similar projects in future.
