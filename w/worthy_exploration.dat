40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} use of porphyrins in photodynamic therapy (PDT), tetraplatinated porphyrins have {{so far not been}} studied for their anticancer properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of such novel platinum-porphyrin conjugates as well as their photophysical characterization and in vitro light-induced anticancer properties. These conjugates showed only minor cytotoxicity in the dark, but IC 50 values down to 19 nm upon irradiation with light at 420 nm. These values correspond to an excellent phototoxic index (PI=IC 50 in the dark/IC 50 in light), which reached 5000 in a cisplatin-resistant cell line. After incubation with HeLa cells, nuclear Pt concentrations were 30 times higher than with cisplatin.

30|$|Therefore, {{although}} {{the research on}} the applications of PP to music education 1 is embryonic, the results obtained {{suggest that it is}} an area <b>worthy</b> of <b>exploration.</b> Furthermore, looking beyond the field of PP, the scholarship of music psychology has shown that studying and playing a musical instrument may impact motivational resources such as self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation (McPherson and Welsh 2012). Teaching which engenders positive self-efficacy and which progresses students from a state of extrinsic to intrinsic motivation, aids student musicians’ senses of autonomy, well-being, and competence (McPherson and Welch 2012). Conversely, teaching which inhibits the development of self-efficacy and undermines the development of intrinsic motivation, is related to music students becoming de-motivated and anxious (Craske and Craig 1984; Kivimäki 1995; Patston 2014). These findings suggest that a teaching model based on PP will be helpful for engaging studio music students.|$|R

The optimised fabrication processes presented here has been utilised for Tm 3 +-doped Si with successful room temperature emission from the 3 F 4 → 3 H 6 [9]. The use of silicon as an optical host material is also very attractive due to its large optical window in the infrared (IR) between 2 and 7 μ m.
