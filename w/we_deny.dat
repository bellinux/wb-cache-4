5|$|Denial of {{responsibility}} via language that obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It {{is said that}} <b>we</b> <b>deny</b> responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E
25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean <b>we</b> <b>deny</b> that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E
500|$|In construing {{the concept}} of {{equality}} in Article 12, the Court held that equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Chief Justice Yong Pung How arrived at this conclusion by considering the history that underpinned the notion of equality. The Court traced the origin of Article 12 back to the 40th article of the Magna Carta which reads, [...] "To none will we sell, to none will <b>we</b> <b>deny,</b> to none will we delay right or justice." ...|$|E
5000|$|Schary {{later wrote}} in his memoirs that [...] "Lanza's {{recordings}} were the prime ingredient for the picture's success, and that success went to Purdom's head.

60|$|The {{capacities}} {{of women are}} supposed to be greater and their senses quicker than those of the men; and what they might be capable of being bred to is plain from some instances of female wit which this age is not without, which upbraids us with injustice, and looks as if <b>we</b> <b>denied</b> women the advantages of education for fear they should vie with the men in their improvements.|$|R
60|$|We {{insisted on}} making both the prisoners plead not guilty. This done, we took an {{objection}} to {{the legality of the}} proceedings at starting. We appealed to the old English law, {{that there should be no}} conviction for murder until the body of the murdered person was found, or proof of its destruction obtained beyond a doubt. <b>We</b> <b>denied</b> that sufficient proof had been obtained in the case now before the court.|$|R
500|$|In the 1998 {{decision}} Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong, the Court of Appeal {{regarded the}} concept of equality {{as a component of}} the wider doctrine of the rule of law, and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states: [...] "To none will we sell, to none will <b>we</b> <b>deny,</b> to none will we delay right or justice." [...] Article 12(1) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying [...] "to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws", and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying [...] "to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India". Article 12(1) is identical to Article 8(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, from which it was adopted following Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2013 interview, Gaahl said {{on freedom}} of speech: [...] "You {{should be able to}} say {{whatever}} you want, it's the only way to evolve.

30|$|Our {{differential}} diagnosis also included liver metastasis from colorectal mucinous carcinoma. In this case, {{there are no}} changes in the preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colono fiberscope and no abnormal uptake of gastrointestinal tracts on FDG-PET. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for cytokeratin 7 and negative staining for cytokeratin 20 and CDX 20. Chu et al. reported that more than 80 % of colorectal cancer has CK 7 -/CK 20 + profiles [14]. CDX 2 was expressed in almost all colorectal cancers [15]. So, <b>we</b> <b>denied</b> the possibility of liver metastasis of colorectal cancer.|$|R

He devoted himself to writing and his two-volume {{history of the}} Dominican Republic, Naboth's Vineyard: The Dominican Republic, 1844-1924 {{appeared}} in 1928. Time described the work as [...] "a ponderous, lifeless, two-volume work which was technically a history of Santo Domingo, actually a careful indictment of U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Hemisphere". James Reston summarized its thesis: [...] "we should keep in our own back yard and stop claiming rights for ourselves that <b>we</b> <b>denied</b> to other sovereign States".|$|R
2500|$|Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett {{stated in}} 2011 [...] "happy {{heterosexual}} marriages {{are the best}} environment for {{the mental health of}} children". Conjecture regarding his status in charity organisation beyondblue followed, though his views on same-sex parenting quickly reversed. In May 2012, Kennett announced he supported a change in the federal Marriage Act to legalise same-sex marriage. In March 2016, following a vigorous parliamentary debate on the merits of the federally funded Safe Schools program in schools, Kennett penned his most passionate defence of same-sex marriage and LGBTI rights yet, arguing [...] "why should <b>we</b> <b>deny</b> those who love each other, regardless of their sex, the right to marry?" [...] and [...] "...ending discrimination against those of the same sex marrying fits into this broader campaign" [...] of anti-discrimination and anti-bullying.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 November 1938, {{following}} Kristallnacht, Pope Pius XI joined Western {{leaders in}} condemning the pogrom. In response, the Nazis organised mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews in Munich, and the Bavarian Gauleiter Adolf Wagner declared before 5,000 protesters: [...] "Every utterance the Pope makes in Rome is an incitement of the Jews {{throughout the world}} to agitate against Germany". On 21 November, in {{an address to the}} world's Catholics, the Pope rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority, and insisted instead that there was only a single human race. Robert Ley, the Nazi Minister of Labour declared the following day in Vienna: [...] "No compassion will be tolerated for the Jews. <b>We</b> <b>deny</b> the Pope's statement that there is but one human race. The Jews are parasites." [...] Catholic leaders, including Cardinal Schuster of Milan, Cardinal van Roey in Belgium and Cardinal Verdier in Paris, backed the Pope's strong condemnation of Kristallnacht.|$|E
2500|$|W.V.O. Quine {{offers a}} {{practical}} {{solution to this problem}} by making the metaphysical claim that only predicates that identify a [...] "natural kind" [...] (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. R. Bhaskar also offers {{a practical solution}} to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if <b>we</b> <b>deny</b> the [...] possibility [...] of [...] a [...] reason for the predicate, [...] located [...] in [...] the [...] enduring [...] nature [...] of [...] something. For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green beryl, made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.|$|E
