25|$|Besides the {{aircraft}} in the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics collection (some of which have survived with no damage or have been restored while others have only survived as components), the museum houses and displays many other artifacts of historical importance: engines, propellers, instruments and components of aircraft, airships and other flying machines as well as documents, medals, models, photographs and personal memorabilia. Among the most noteworthy, however, the following can be cited: the Piaggio P.XIbis R.C.40D engine that equipped the Caproni Ca.161bis which, in 1938, established an altitude world record for piston-engine aircraft which stands to the present day; a fragment of the Blériot XI that Jorge Chávez successfully completed the first air crossing of the Alps in 1910; the <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> of a Wright brothers biplane; Guglielmo Marconi's radio which he used for the first communication by air balloons and airships, and the fuel tank of a Supermarine Spitfire which crashed in Italy during World War II.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to obtain information for use in the design of truss and plywood forms, particularly with reference to <b>wing</b> <b>ribs.</b> Tests were made on many designs of <b>wing</b> <b>ribs,</b> comparing different types in various sizes. Many tests were also made on parallel-chord specimens of truss and plywood forms in place of the actual ribs and on parts of <b>wing</b> <b>ribs,</b> such as truss diagonals and sections of cap strips. It was found that for ribs of any size or proportions, when they were designed to obtain a well-balanced construction and were carefully manufactured, distinct types are of various efficiencies; the efficiency is based on the strength per unit of weight. In all types of ribs the heavier are the stronger per unit of weight. Reductions in the weight of <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> are accompanied even in efficient designs by a much greater proportional reduction in strength...|$|R

50|$|The two-spar wing had a {{straight}} leading edge and constant chord {{out to a}} little over half span, where the trailing edges of the ailerons, hinged at a slight angle to the spar, curved inwards to the wingtips. It was braced from above with pairs of wires from the spars to a central, inverted V-strut pylon and below by wires to the lower nacelle longerons. There were no flaps or air brakes. The central <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> was continued rearward with the upper member of the open, flat, converging Warren girder fuselage, whose lower member joined the keel of the plywood- and fabric-covered nacelle just aft of the wing trailing edge. This placed the open single cockpit just forward of the wing leading edge. A central keel skid formed the main undercarriage, with assistance from a tail bumper. A narrow-span, triangular tailplane, wire braced above and below, carried longer-span elevators with rounded tips and a cut-out for the deep, rounded rudder hinged to small, triangular fin.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1920s {{the country}} was wild about {{aeronautics}} and the exploits of the many daring pilots of those times. This enthusiasm reached a highpoint with Charles Lindbergh’s successful solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927. It was around this time that Joe, lacking the necessary social and financial resources, not long married and with a young daughter, yet having faith in his own technical talent, decided to build his own plane. At {{the time he was}} living in a rented house in Queens County New York. As he described it in his autobiographical notes, one night after work in the printing plant, he was relaxing reading a magazine when he came upon an ad for a book called [...] "The Sport Plane Constructor." [...] The price was $1, and the [...] "book" [...] consisted of 32 pages with crudely executed drawings. As an extra, the author offered to sell a jig, or wooden form for holding the various pieces of a <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> for gluing and nailing. With it, the uniformly sized ribs would be ready for mounting on the wing spars, so Joe bought the jig as well.|$|E
5000|$|The J 2 {{differed}} from the J 1 in having a cowling that almost entirely enclosed the engine, a rounded upper and lower fusalage section instead of the rectangular section of the J 1., and a narrower and deeper ventral radiator enclosure, and had a horizontal stabilizer planform shape that would become familiar on later, all-duralumin Junkers monoplane designs to be built during 1917-18. The [...] "all-moving" [...] rudder still possessed no fixed fin, like the J 1. A faired-in headrest was provided for, {{as well as the}} possibly pioneering appearance of a [...] "roll bar" [...] for an open-cockpit aircraft, placed above the headrest for additional pilot protection in case of the aircraft overturning during landing. The landing gear was of the usual vee-type, but taller than that of the J 1's, and having the upper ends of the legs anchored not onto the lower longerons as on the J 1, but to the first <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> bay beyond the wing root, with a long tailskid that emerged from the lower rear fuselage directly below the stabilizer's leading edge root. The wings had at least three different airfoil changes between root and tip, and had sections of them electrically roll-welded for stronger, more continuous bonding for greater strength. The resulting aircraft was intended to be smaller than the J 1 demonstrator, but with its steel structure, it almost equalled the J 1's completed weight.|$|E
50|$|Burnett worked {{full-time}} for Ryan Aviation after ending school. One fall, he {{was laid}} off but he, determined to work, returned without pay. This resulted in him receiving flying instruction from the company as a Christmas present later that year in 1925. He began flying on his own after instruction of only four hours. In 1926, before even the federal government restricted activities in the air, the City of San Diego set up licensing for pilots. Burnett was within the first three pilots to receive their licsense from the city. Around this time, Charles Lindbergh came to Ryan to have the Spirit of St. Louis built. Burnett, obsessed with wings, worked on the woodworking and design of the wings. Lindbergh and Burnett became friends throughout the process. Lindbergh's wife even visited Dan's baby shower for his daughter. Before Lindbergh's flight, Burnett asked him to take a one dollar bill and a letter, both signed by Captain Martell and a red carnation given to him by Lieutenant Kelley. The carnation was the first flower to fly across the Atlantic. Lindbergh also said that he prized the possessions. The dollar bill later transferred hands to Sir Hubert Wilkins for his flight to the Antarctic and on Doles' race with Martin Jensen to Honolulu. Dan later worked for a while on parachute development with Jimmy Russell. In 1930, he then worked for the Bowlus Sailplane Company as the Superintendent. Then in 1933, returned to Ryan Aviation. In 1937, he became the foreman of wing and control surface assembly at Ryan. And in 1939, he became the head of the experimental department and was later appointed night superintendent in 1940. The San Diego Air and Space Museum acquired a <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> jib that Burnett had built for the St. Louis and started selling replica wing ribs in the '80s for $45 along with a certificate of authenticity with Burnetts name on it. Burnett died on June 13, 1976.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis work {{presents}} {{the development of}} a parameterized automated generic model for the structural design of an aircraft wing. Furthermore, in order to perform finite element analysis on the aircraft wing geometry, the process of finite element mesh generation is automated. Aircraft conceptual design is inherently a multi-disciplinary design process which involves a large number of disciplines and expertise. In this thesis work, it is investigated how high-end CAD software‟s can be used {{in the early stages of}} an aircraft design process, especially for the design of an aircraft wing and its structural entities wing spars and <b>wing</b> <b>ribs.</b> The generic model that is developed in this regard is able to automate the process of creation and modification of the aircraft wing geometry based on a series of parameters which define the geometrical characteristics of wing panels, wing spars and <b>wing</b> <b>ribs.</b> Two different approaches are used for the creation of the generic model of an aircraft wing which are “Knowledge Pattern” and “PowerCopy with Visual Basic Scripting” using the CATIA V 5 software. A performance comparison of the generic wing model based on these two approaches is also performed. In the early stages of the aircraft design process, an estimate of the structural characteristic of the aircraft wing is desirable for which a surface structural analysis (using 2 D mesh elements) is more suitable. In this regard, the process of finite element mesh generation for the generic wing model is automated. The finite element mesh is generated for the wing panels, wing spars and <b>wing</b> <b>ribs.</b> Furthermore, the finite element mesh is updated based on any changes in geometry and the shape of the wing panels, wing spars or <b>wing</b> <b>ribs,</b> and ensure that all the mesh elements are always properly connected at the nodes. The automated FE mesh generated can be used for performing the structural analysis on an aircraft wing...|$|R

40|$|Students of the Aviation Department at Purdue University {{enroll in}} a {{computer}} graphics course (CGT 162) during their freshmen year, and in this course {{they learn how to}} use the CATIA V 5 Solid modeling software. CATIA V 5 solid modeling software is used extensively in the aerospace industry to design aircraft and aircraft parts. The authors of this paper have incorporated a new project in the AT 166 Aircraft Materials II course to reinforce the knowledge gained in the introductory course and to apply this new skill set to design, and manufacture an aluminum alloy formed <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> using CNC equipment and conventional sheet metal equipment. For this project students select a wing airfoil using commercial available software based on assigned parameters like gross weight, cruise speed and stall speed. An airfoil for a small piston powered experimental aircraft is selected with a maximum gross weight of 500 pounds, cruise speed of 150 mph, and a stall speed of 50 mph. Airfoil optimizer software is used to download the drawings of the selected airfoil. The CATIA V 5 part design workbench is used to model the <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> form blocks, and the sheet metal design workbench is used to model the formed <b>wing</b> <b>rib.</b> A complete set of engineering drawings is generated to manufacture the parts. The flat pattern layout of the <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> is cut with a CNC mill, and the <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> is formed by using form blocks, and a press brake. The authors have noticed that students quickly lose the knowledge acquired during the introductory CGT course, if they don’t use it. By introducing new coursework that builds on existing knowledge, they hope to improve the student’s knowledge of design software and CNC machining. The students are introduced to a complete manufacturing cycle from conceptual design to the actual manufacture of the part...|$|E
