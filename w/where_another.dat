He is now the third longest-lived president, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. He was the first U.S. president to die in the 21st century, and his was the first state funeral in the United States since that of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973.|$|E

In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items.

5|$|By1929, the {{construction}} had reached Lawrence Township, <b>where</b> <b>another</b> {{long stretch of}} highway was built. During1930, {{the construction}} had reached Clinton, Glen Gardener, and Washington. Construction of the highway progressed northbound, with sections of the Mercer-Hunterdon-Warren route reaching Hunterdon County in1931. The Hunterdon County portion up to the Musconetcong River was constructed for six months, with completion in October1931. Construction of the highway northward from the Musconetcong River started in October of the same year. The mainline construction reached the northern terminus in Buttzville in1932. The route, although the construction had reached its northern end, was not complete due to bypasses around Clinton and Pennington were proposed to be built. These bypasses were never constructed, and during1934, more portions of the highway in Hunterdon County were finished. The route was completed in1935, providing an uninterrupted route from {{the capital city of}} Trenton to northern Warren County.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, <b>where</b> <b>another</b> refraction matrix applies.|$|E

Mancera studied at Miguel Alemán Primary School and Secondary School 45, both located in Benito Juárez borough. He studied high school at Preparatoria 6, a high school that belongs to the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). According to Mancera, when he was a teenager he had a car accident, <b>where</b> <b>another</b> car crashed into his, and Mancera was the passenger. The public prosection service asked Mancera to sign a document that exempted the driver of the car that caused the accident from liability.

Once the epidemic passed, Parliament began to raid the town and Henry worked through Ferdinando to agree the surrender of the castle on good terms: this was achieved in February 1646, and allowed for the release of himself, the garrison and their weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year, the cancer had spread into Chapman's spinal cord, <b>where</b> <b>another</b> tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E
