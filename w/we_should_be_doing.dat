2500|$|McGahey {{continuously}} {{insisted that}} the NUM {{find a way to}} reconcile with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (a Midlands-based breakaway from the NUM).

2500|$|Speaking to Mojo editor Jim Irvin in December 2006, Giles Martin {{said that}} he first created a demo {{combining}} [...] "Within You Without You" [...] with [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", which he then nervously presented to McCartney and Starr for their approval.

2500|$|Miners were demoralised {{and sought}} work in other industries. Scargill's {{authority}} in the NUM was challenged and his calls for another strike in 1986 were ignored. Mick McGahey, who was loyal to Scargill during the strike, became critical of him. McGahey claimed the leadership was becoming separated from its membership, the violence {{had gone too far}} and argued for reconciliation with the UDM. Scargill said that it was a [...] "tragedy that people from the far north should pontificate about what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> to win back members for the NUM." [...] Scargill became president of the NUM for life in 1985.|$|E

5000|$|An April 5, 2013 {{article in}} the Consumerist {{includes}} photographs of Walmart shelves which are only partially stocked, primarily in health and beauty products. One employee is quoted as saying, [...] "As {{soon as we get}} a full crew we start to lose people through them quitting or being fired. Management seems to wait until we need 6 or 7 people, then we get a rash of new hires." [...] And another employee is quoted as saying, [...] "they make the rest of us work faster and harder, saying the task manager system, which is basically a point-of-sale system telling them how long it should take us to do our job, says <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> already or we’re taking too long." ...|$|R
2500|$|During a radio {{interview}} with Fox News Radio in 2012, Portman said: [...] "The president [...] says, you know, 'we're doing more.' Well, {{on public lands}}, we're doing less. Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> more on public lands, and that's the outer continental shelf and what's going on in Alaska and so on." [...] Portman supports development of the Keystone XL pipeline, stating [...] "The arguments when you line them up are too strong not to do this. I do think {{that at the end}} of the day the president [...] is going to go ahead with this." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the vast}} library where the {{celluloid}} {{literature of the}} screen is stored there is one small, uncrowded shelf devoted to the cinema's masterworks, to those films which by dignity of theme and excellence of treatment seem to be of enduring artistry, seem destined to be recalled not merely {{at the end of}} their particular year but whenever great motion pictures are mentioned. To that shelf of screen classics Twentieth Century-Fox yesterday added its version of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, adapted by Nunnally Johnson, directed by John Ford and performed at the Rivoli by a cast of such uniform excellence and suitability that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> its other members an injustice by saying it was [...] "headed" [...] by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and Russell Simpson.|$|E
2500|$|Bowie had {{reconnected}} with Brian Eno at {{his wedding}} to Iman Abdulmajid in 1992. Bowie and Eno each played pieces {{of their own}} music at the wedding reception and delighted at the [...] "ebb and flow" [...] of couples on the dance floor. At that point, Bowie knew [...] "we were both interested in nibbling at {{the periphery of the}} mainstream rather than jumping in. We sent each other long manifestoes about what was missing in music and what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing.</b> We decided to really experiment and go into the studio with not even a gnat of an idea." [...] Bowie and Eno visited the Gugging psychiatric hospital near Vienna, Austria in early 1994 and interviewed and photographed its patients, who were famous for their [...] "Outsider art". Bowie and Eno brought some of that art back with them into the studio as they worked together in March 1994, coming up with a three-hour piece that was mostly dialogue. Late in 1994, Q magazine asked Bowie to write a diary for 10 days (to later be published in the magazine), but Bowie, fearful his diary would be boring ("...going to a studio, coming home and going to bed"), instead wrote a diary for one of the fictional characters (Nathan Adler) from his earlier improvisation with Eno. Bowie said [...] "Rather than 10 days, it became 15 years in his life!" [...] This became the basis for the story of 1. Outside.|$|E

50|$|Director Donald Crombie {{looked back}} on the film with mixed emotion:That {{probably}} shouldn't have been made. It {{was a bit of}} an aberration.

2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of people have said that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we probably need to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well as we should have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E

[...] "The child may not turn out ill with the weaver. But, then, he didn't go to seek her, as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing.</b> It will be wrong: I feel sure it will. Don't you {{remember}} what that lady {{we met at the}} Royston Baths told us about the child her sister adopted? That was the only adopting I ever heard of: and the child was transported when it was twenty-three. Dear Godfrey, don't ask me to do what I know is wrong: I should never be happy again. I know it's very hard for you--it's easier for me--but it's the will of Providence." ...|$|E

5000|$|Hephaestus was {{associated}} by Greek colonists in southern Italy with the volcano gods Adranus (of Mount Etna) and Vulcanus of the Lipari islands.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> {{more than}} justice to Anarchism {{if we did}} not say {{something}} of its darker side, the side which has brought it into conflict with the police and made it a word of terror to ordinary citizens. In its general doctrines there is nothing essentially involving violent methods or a virulent hatred of the rich, and many who adopt these general doctrines are personally gentle and temperamentally averse from violence. But the general tone of the Anarchist press and public is bitter to a degree that seems scarcely sane, and the appeal, especially in Latin countries, is rather to envy of the fortunate than to pity for the unfortunate. A vivid and readable, though not wholly reliable, account, from a hostile point of view, is given in a book called ``Le Peril Anarchiste,'' by Felix Dubois,[17] which incidentally reproduces a number of cartoons from anarchist journals. The revolt against law naturally leads, except in those who are controlled by a real passion for humanity, to a relaxation of all the usually accepted moral rules, and to a bitter spirit of retaliatory cruelty out of which good can hardly come.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilding, as we know, was {{to remain}} at Bridgwater {{for the purpose of}} {{collecting}} from Mr. Newlington the fine which had been imposed upon him. It is by no means clear whether Monmouth realized the fullness of the tragedy at the merchant's house, and whether he understood that, stricken with apoplexy at the thought of parting with so considerable a portion of his fortune, Mr. Newlington had not merely fainted, but had expired under His Grace's eyes. If he did realize it he was cynically indifferent, and lest <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> him an injustice by assuming this we had better give him the benefit of the doubt, and take it that in the subsequent bustle of departure, his mind filled with the prospect of the night attack to be delivered upon his uncle's army at-Sedgemoor, he thought no more either of Mr. Newlington or of Mr. Wilding. The latter, as we know, had no place in the rebel army; although a man of his hands, he was not a trained soldier, and notwithstanding that he may fully have intended to draw his sword for Monmouth when the time came, yet circumstances had led to his continuing after Monmouth's landing the more diplomatic work of movement-man, in which he had been engaged for the months that had preceded it.|$|E
6000|$|But <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> {{injustice}} to le Bourdon, were we in {{any manner}} to confound him with the [...] "dickering" [...] race. He was a bee- hunter quite as much through love of the wilderness and love of adventure, as through love of gain. Profitable he had certainly found the employment, or he {{probably would not have}} pursued it; but there was many a man who--nay, most men, even in his own humble class in life-would have deemed his liberal earnings too hardly obtained, when gained at the expense of all intercourse with their own kind. But Buzzing Ben loved the solitude of his situation, its hazards, its quietude, relieved by passing moments of high excitement; and, most of all, the self-reliance that was indispensable equally to his success and his happiness. Woman, as yet, had never exercised her witchery over him, and every day was his passion for dwelling alone, and for enjoying the strange, but certainly most alluring, pleasures of the woods, increasing and gaining strength in his bosom. It was seldom, now, that he held intercourse even with the Indian tribes that dwelt near his occasional places of hunting; and frequently had he shifted his ground in order to avoid collision, however friendly, with whites who, like himself, were pushing their humble fortunes along the shores of those inland seas, which, as yet, were rarely indeed whitened by a sail. In this respect, Boden and Waring were the very antipodes of each other; Gershom being an inveterate gossip, in despite of his attachment to a vagrant and border life.|$|E
