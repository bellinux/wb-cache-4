After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a <b>white</b> <b>blouse,</b> and boots, and carried her away.|$|E

25|$|At 6:30a.m. on April 16, {{the body}} of a 13-year-old schoolgirl named Dawn Louise Basom was found {{discarded}} beside a desolate road in Ypsilanti. Clothed only in a <b>white</b> <b>blouse</b> and bra, which had been pushed around her neck, she had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and genitals, had received multiple slash wounds across the breasts, buttocks and stomach, then strangled to death with a two-foot length electrical flex still knotted around her neck. A handkerchief found stuffed in her mouth had likely been placed there to muffle her cries throughout her torture, and her murderer had placed her body in a location where rapid discovery was assured.|$|E
25|$|During the Whitewater {{investigation}} in the 1990s, Susan McDougal, held in contempt for refusing to testify before special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's grand jury, was perp-walked wearing leg irons and a waist chain as well as handcuffs, which she wore over an ensemble consisting of a jacket, <b>white</b> <b>blouse,</b> miniskirt, black stockings and high heels. Starr was criticized for what {{was seen as a}} gratuitous attempt to humiliate an uncooperative witness. He claimed his office {{had nothing to do with}} the level of restraint she wore, and the marshals' service said that was standard for all prisoners in transit. In 1995 Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, already in Oklahoma Highway Patrol custody for a firearms violation, was paraded before television cameras by the FBI nearly three hours before he was officially arrested for the bombing. His lawyers later asked to have eyewitness identifications of him excluded from evidence, on the grounds that they were all based on the widely televised perp walk and none of the witness had been asked to pick him out of a lineup.|$|E
25|$|The Ch’ols of Chiapas {{migrated}} to the northwest of the state starting about 2,000 years ago, when they were concentrated in Guatemala and Honduras. Those Ch’ols who remained in the south are distinguished by the name Chortís. Chiapas Ch’ols {{are closely related to}} the Chontal in Tabasco as well. Choles are found in Tila, Tumbalá, Sabanilla, Palenque, and Salto de Agua, with an estimated population of about 115,000 people. The Ch’ol language belongs to the Maya family and is related to Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Lacandon, Tojolabal, and Yucatec Mayan. There are three varieties of Chol (spoken in Tila, Tumbalá, and Sabanilla), all mutually intelligible. Over half of speakers are monolingual in the Chol language. Women wear a long navy blue or black skirt with a <b>white</b> <b>blouse</b> heavily embroidered with bright colors and a sash with a red ribbon. The men only occasionally use traditional dress for events such as the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This dress usually includes pants, shirts and huipils made of undyed cotton, with leather huaraches, a carrying sack and a hat. The fundamental economic activity of the Ch’ols is agriculture. They primarily cultivate corn and beans, as well as sugar cane, rice, coffee, and some fruits. They have Catholic beliefs strongly influenced by native ones. Harvests are celebrated on the Feast of Saint Rose on 30 August.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Rowland is seen dressed in waist-high trousers, a <b>white</b> <b>blouse,</b> and a black tie. The first scene of the video features Rowland and her love interest, played by Alvino Lewis, arguing. During the song's build-up, she is dressed in a black-and-white netted catsuit, standing in front of pink and red streamers. Just before the chorus, she appears in a low cut corset against a dark backdrop with her hair tied in a tight bun. In the chorus, she appears in a gold dress on a turntable surrounded by smoke, spliced with scenes of the argument and a blue-tinged image of Rowland. As she sings the hook of the song, the camera flicks to a scene where she is surrounded by windswept rose petals (top frame). During the second verse, the blue tinged image of Rowland is seen again, as is a new scene where she is on the turntable again dressed in a black ball gown with frills around the neck and shoulder. This is spliced with more scenes of Rowland in her gold dress. As the chorus builds for a second time, Rowland is seen wearing a tube dress before switching to the dark corset scene where it begins to rain. Rowland is then seen surrounded by white doves (bottom frame) which fly around her while she spins on the circular trap. The bridge of the song focuses on the dark corset scenes where the rain increases and Rowland's facial expressions display deep sadness. Billboard commented on the last scenes: [...] "In the end, Rowland finally takes those 'Rose Colored Glasses' off – the ones that have prevented her from seeing how truly damaging her relationship is – punching through a glass wall before pastel-colored butterflies appear in representation of her breakthrough." [...] The video ends with blue-tinged images, where she sheds a single tear.|$|E
