500|$|Several {{film and}} {{entertainment}} critics have noted similarities and {{parallels between the}} stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, and their protagonists. [...] Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and {{came as a surprise}} to the filmmakers themselves; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it. [...] According to Hahn, [...] "When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet. [...] Everyone responded favorably to the idea that we were doing something Shakespearean, so <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> look for ways to model our film on that all-time classic." ...|$|E
500|$|At that time, a Parisian ballet {{audience}} typically {{consisted of}} two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [...] "Bohemian" [...] group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would [...] "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions [...] began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: [...] "Everything available was tossed in our direction, but <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with {{the intervention of the}} police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.|$|E

She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... <b>We</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E

60|$|Then we sat {{ourselves}} down {{to partake}} of food {{for the first time}} since leaving the encampment, and I noted with no little anxiety that if <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> have such appetites during the next four and twenty hours, our store of food would be sadly diminished.|$|E
