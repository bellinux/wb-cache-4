50|$|In 1947, Bernard Welding Equipment Co. {{was founded}} in Chicago, Illinois by Arthur Bernard, {{one of the first}} welding {{engineers}} in America. Bernard Welding Equipment Co. manufactured welding guns and other <b>welding</b> <b>accessories.</b> In 1970 Arthur's son Richard who was the president of the company at the time, sold the company to Dover Corporation (now part of Illinois Tool Works).|$|E

40|$|Hollow {{sections}} {{have become}} increasingly popular in structural applications due to their structural efficiency. However, their use in low rise structures is hampered by the limited means of providing fully bolted site connections. This limitation can be overcome by using blind bolting system which requires access to one side only. This eliminates both the problem of lack of access and also the need to <b>weld</b> various <b>accessories</b> to the hollow sections. This paper {{is part of an}} ongoing research project which focuses on the development of a range of connections to hollow sections using blind bolts. The paper provides a review of recent research undertaken to develop rigid and semi-rigid connections. Preliminary results from non-linear finite element models are presented and compared against the column face plastification formula based on yield line theory. The predicted load by the formula shows good agreement to the results from the finite element model...|$|R

The paper presents the results of an experimental program for blind bolted channel side plate connections to unfilled hollow section columns under static loading. The channel side plate connection was found to be much stiffer than a typical face connection and has the potential to achieve a rigid connection for braced frames according to the EC 3 classifications...|$|R
