40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the differences in gender and gender-identity in empathy towards males or females <b>who</b> <b>commit</b> suicide. It was hypothesized that participants of the female gender and participants with a (very) feminine gender-identity would have more empathy towards people <b>who</b> <b>commit</b> suicide, and that females <b>who</b> <b>commit</b> suicide would get more empathy from participants than males <b>who</b> <b>commit</b> suicide. To investigate this, 125 adult {{participants were asked to}} complete a series of questions, which include the Attitudes Towards Suicide (ATTS – empathy towards suicide), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI – general empathy) and Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ – gender-identity). Results indicated that none of the hypotheses was supported. There were no differences in empathy between male or female participants, between males or females <b>who</b> <b>commit</b> suicide or between participants high in masculine or high in feminine gender-identity. It is possible that the hypothesized differences are only important with adolescent participants. The present study found that younger participants have significantly more empathy towards people <b>who</b> <b>commit</b> suicide than older participants when participants were put in two groups (18 - 24 years and older than 25 years). This may explain why none of the hypotheses were supported in this group of adults. Future research should investigate the difference in empathy towards suicide in adolescents and young adults (under 25 years) and adults (older than 25 years) ...|$|R

5|$|The next year, {{a council}} held at Westminster {{became one of}} the early stages in the king's growing quarrel with Becket over {{criminal}} clerks. The quarrel was sparked by the problem of clergy <b>who</b> <b>committed</b> crimes; Becket supported the Church's position that all clergy, even those in minor orders, could be tried only in ecclesiastical courts. As perhaps as many as a fifth of the population of England may have been in some form of clerical orders, including the minor ones, allowing this would have diminished the king's authority. In the past, English law had tried clerks <b>who</b> <b>committed</b> serious offences in the royal courts, but recent changes in canon law were changing this practice. At Westminster, Henry tried to get the leading laymen and bishops to swear to uphold the old customs of England, instead of the newer canon law practices. All the bishops swore, with the reservation that the customs were not in conflict with canon law. Hilary, however, added no qualifiers to his oath. Although the oath supported Becket's position, after the council most of the bishops, including Hilary, were persuaded by the king to support some compromise position, and threw their support behind Henry.|$|E
5|$|Henry and Becket quickly {{disagreed}} over {{a number}} of issues, including Becket's attempts to regain control of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies. The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy <b>who</b> <b>committed</b> secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while Becket maintained that only church courts could try the cases. The matter came to a head in January 1164, when Henry forced through agreement to the Constitutions of Clarendon; under tremendous pressure, Becket temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards. The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.|$|E

5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons <b>who</b> <b>committed</b> sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E

The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt.|$|E
