In the past, the occasional and unexpected occurrence of aggressive fluxes in the electrostatic precipitator (e-filters) has troubled several operators.

50|$|Visitors {{could walk}} {{up the stairs and}} take a reading in the Reading Room atop the Tower.At the moment when the water reached its highest {{possible}} point in the glass pipe, visitors could witness an interesting physical phenomenon for about a minute. The air pressure above the water had lowered dramatically. Therefore, the evaporation of the water happened so vigorously that the water started to boil spontaneously, although its temperature rarely exceeded 20 °C. This ‘cold boiling’ is contributed to by air bubbles that were formed in the water column. As soon as the pump was disconnected, the evacuating of the pipe stopped and the water level became calm again, enabling people to take a reading. During the time the water level was calm, there was still some turbulence at the surface due to air bubbles rising {{to the top of the}} apparatus. Although <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> depressed the barometers pressure reading, visitors were told how to correct for this error and thus calculate the real air pressure, and could then compare it with the accurate Vaisala digital standard barometer in the Tower.After a reading period of two minutes, air was gradually admitted to the vacuum in the top area of the pipe.

5000|$|Respiration is a {{continuing}} process in a plant and cannot be stopped without damage to the growing plant or harvested produce. It uses stored starch or sugar and stops when reserves of these are exhausted, leading to ageing. Respiration depends on a good air supply. When the air supply is restricted fermentation instead of respiration can occur. Poor ventilation of produce also leads to the accumulation of carbon dioxide. When the concentration of carbon dioxide increases it will quickly ruin produce. [...] Fresh produce continues to lose water after harvest. Water loss causes shrinkage and loss of weight. The rate at which water is lost varies according to the product. Leafy vegetables lose water quickly {{because they have a}} thin skin with many pores. Potatoes, on the other hand, have a thick skin with few pores. But whatever the product, to extend shelf or storage life the rate of water loss must be minimal. The most significant factor is the ratio of the surface area of the fruit or vegetable to its volume. The greater the ratio the more rapid will be the loss of water. The rate of loss is related to the difference between the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the produce and in the air. Produce must therefore be kept in a moist atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|State {{of the art}} {{processes}} that separate mass flows by a membrane, mostly use a static pressure difference as the driving force between the two bounding surfaces (e.g. RO), a difference in concentration (dialysis) or an electric field (ED). Selectivity of a membrane is produced by, either its pore size {{in relation to the}} size of the substance to be retained, its diffusion coefficient or electrical polarity. However, the selectivity of membranes used for membrane distillation (MD) is based on the retention of liquid water with-at the same time- permeability for free water molecules and thus, for water vapour. These membranes are made of hydrophobic synthetic material (e.g. PTFE, PVDF or PP) and offer pores with a standard diameter between 0.1 and 0.5 µm. As water has strong dipole characteristics, whilst the membrane fabric is non-polar, the membrane material is not wetted by the liquid. Even though the pores are considerably larger than the molecules, the liquid phase does not enter the pores because of the high water surface tension. A convex meniscus develops into the pore. This effect is named capillary action. Amongst other factors, the depth of impression can depend on the external pressure load on the liquid. A dimension for the infiltration of the pores by the liquid is the contact angle Θ=180 - Θ'. As long as Θ > 90° and accordingly Θ' > 0° no wetting of the pores will take place. If the external pressure rises above the so-called wetting pressure, then Θ = 90°resulting in a bypass of the pore. The driving force which delivers the vapour through the membrane, in order to collect it on the permeate side as product water, is the partial <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference between the two bounding surfaces. This partial pressure difference is the result of a temperature difference between the two bounding surfaces. As can be seen in the image, the membrane is charged with a hot feed flow on one side and a cooled permeate flow on the other side. The temperature difference through the membrane, usually between 5 and 20 K, conveys a partial pressure difference which ensures that the vapour developing at the membrane surface follows the pressure drop, permeating through the pores and condensing on the cooler side.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of reliable, reasonably accurate and relatively inexpensive estimates of sensible heat and latent energy fluxes was investigated using a commercial combination thin-film polymer capacitive relative humidity and adjacent temperature sensor instrument. Long-term and unattended <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> profile difference measurements using low-power combination instruments {{were compared with}} those from a cooled dewpoint mirror hygrometer, the latter often used with Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems. An error analysis, based on instrument relative humidity and temperature errors, was applied for various capacitive humidity instrument models. The main disadvantage of a combination capacitive humidity instrument is that two measurements, relative humidity and temperature, are required for estimation of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> as opposed to one for a dewpoint hygrometer. In a laboratory experiment using an automated procedure, <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences generated using a reference dewpoint generator were measured using a commercial model (Dew- 10) dewpoint hygrometer and a combination capacitive humidity instrument. The laboratory measurement comparisons showed that, potentially, an inexpensive model combination capacitive humidity instrument (CS 500 or HMP 50), or for improved results a slightly more expensive model (HMP 35 C or HMP 45 C), could substitute for the more expensive dewpoint hygrometer. In a field study, in a mesic grassland, the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement noise for the combination capacitive humidity instruments was greater than that for the dewpoint hygrometer. The average <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> profile difference measured using a HMP 45 C was highly correlated with that from a dewpoint hygrometer with a slope less than unity. <b>Water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements using the capacitive humidity instruments were not as accurate, compared to those obtained using a dewpoint hygrometer, but the resolution magnitudes for the profile difference measurements were less than the minimum of 0. 01 kPa required for BREB measurements when averaged over 20 min. Furthermore, the longer-term capacitive humidity measurements are more reliable and not dependent on a sensor bias adjustment {{as is the case}} for the dewpoint hygrometer. A field comparison of CS 500 and HMP 45 C profile <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences yielded a slope of close to unity. However, the CS 500 exhibited more variable <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements mainly due to its increased variation in temperature measurements compared to the HMP 45 C. Comparisons between 20 -min BREB sensible heat fluxes obtained using a HMP 45 C and a dewpoint hygrometer yielded a slope of almost unity. BREB sensible heat fluxes measured using a HMP 45 C were reasonably well correlated with those obtained using a surface-layer scintillometer and eddy covariance (slope of 0. 9629 and 0. 9198 respectively). This reasonable agreement showed that a combination capacitive humidity instrument, with similar relative humidity (RH) and temperature error magnitudes of at most 2 % RH and 0. 3 °C respectively, and similar measurement time response, would be an adequate and less expensive substitute for a dewpoint hygrometer. Furthermore, a combination capacitive humidity instrument requires no servicing compared to a dewpoint hygrometer which requires a bias adjustment and mirror cleaning each week. These findings make unattended BREB measurements of sensible heat flux and evaporation cheaper and more reliable with the system easier to assemble and service and with reduced instrument power...|$|E

The findings revealed no correlation between humidity, season, <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> and haemorrhage rates. Further research should use multi-site data to investigate the effect of air conditioning, humidification and climactic conditions between different regions in Australia.

40|$|Henry's law {{constants}} (HLC) {{are derived}} for several polyols bearing between 2 and 6 hydroxyl groups, based on literature data for <b>water</b> activity, <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> and/or solubility. While deriving HLC {{and depending on}} the case, also infinite dilution activity coefficients (IDACs), solid state <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> or activity coefficient ratios are obtained as intermediate results. An error analysis on the intermediate quantities and the obtained HLC is included. For most compounds, these are the first values reported, while others compare favourably with literature data in most cases. Using these values and those from a previous work (Compernolle and Müller, 2014), an assessment is made on the partitioning of polyols, diacids and hydroxy acids to droplet and aqueous aerosol...|$|R

40|$|Recently it was proposed, {{that the}} {{hampered}} formation of external protective chromia scales on FeCr-alloys in <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> containing, low-pO(2) gases is correlated with enhanced internal oxidation of chromium. In {{the present study}} the internal oxidation kinetics of Fe- 10 Cr (in mass%) during isothermal oxidation in Ar-H- 2 -H 2 O mixtures at temperatures in the range 800 - 1050 degrees C has been investigated. It {{was found that the}} tendency for Cr to become internally oxidized decreased with decreasing temperature. At the higher test temperatures the internal oxide precipitates consisted of Fe/Cr-spinel. With decreasing temperature the precipitates near the oxidation front gradually exhibited increasing amounts of chromia. At 900 degrees C the oxidation morphology in the Ar-H- 2 base gas mixture changed from exclusive internal oxidation of Cr at a <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content of 2 % towards a combined internal Cr oxidation and external Fe-oxide formation at higher <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> partial <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
