The epoxy-coated dowel bars are placed in the slots, then the slots are filled with grout and the joints or cracks are filled with waterproof caulk. The final step is to diamond-grind the joint to remove both excess grout and any displacement of the panels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper proposes the {{practical}} method for MW- redispatching and identifying <b>wheeling</b> <b>paths</b> taking transmission line constraint into account {{based on an}} extended sensitivity analysis. Because the decision for the MW- dispatch / scheduling is requested to be very fast, the method proposed here brings the efficiency of computations by utilizing the existing practical approaches for obtaining the optimal solution. So, in this paper, a method of MW- redispatching by using {{the practical}} sensitivity-based technique, which is used for identifying the <b>wheeling</b> <b>paths</b> in overloaded states is proposed. By the proposed method, the MW-redispatching problem without using OPF solutions can be solved. On the other hand, in deregulated electricity markets, appropriate and efficient levying of the wheeling rate {{is one of the}} critical issues. It is obvious that if <b>wheeling</b> <b>paths</b> from suppliers to customers could be identified appropriately, it becomes possible to set up the proper and fair wheeling rate according to the degree of power flow in each <b>wheeling</b> <b>path.</b> Until now, we have reported {{that it is possible to}} identify <b>paths</b> of the <b>wheeling</b> in any situation effectively by making use of the sensitivities calculated by an extended sensitivity analysis. In the previous research based on the sensitivity analysis, constrains on transmission lines have not been taken into consideration.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the impact of}} differential skid resistance between <b>wheel</b> <b>paths</b> on {{the speed at which}} a vehicle can safely negotiate a curve. Currently the New Zealand Transport Agency undertakes measurement of the co-efficient of friction on the state highway network by measuring both <b>wheel</b> <b>paths,</b> but taking the average value to represent the level of skid resistance available. Part of the basis for this approach is that modern cars have Electronic Stability Control that has historically been considered to negate the effects of any differential friction. Aside from straight line braking testing, little research has been done on the impacts of differential friction on curves. There are however a number of areas of research that can be related to this topic. By PC Crash simulation modeling, this research identifies {{that there are a number}} of gaps in our understanding of the relationship between vehicles maneuvering on a curve and the effect of varying skid resistance. It concludes that taking the average of the two values is not the same as considering them separately and, that as the difference in the co-efficient of friction between the <b>wheel</b> <b>paths</b> increases, the speed at which a vehicle can safely maneuver around a curve decreases. It has also been found that when Electronic Stability Control is used the speed at which the vehicle can safely maneuver around a curve decreases further...|$|R

40|$|The {{position}} and width of <b>wheel</b> <b>path</b> on a pavement lane {{is an important}} consideration in conducting pavement distress survey, especially for distinguishing longitudinal cracking from fatigue cracking. Currently, the widely used <b>wheel</b> <b>path</b> definition {{is derived from the}} LTPP distress manual with fixed width and position, in which the influence of traffic wander on <b>wheel</b> <b>path</b> was overlooked. This thesis attempts to develop a new <b>wheel</b> <b>path</b> definition based on the lateral placement investigation of heavy vehicles 2 ̆ 7 wandering in the field. Generally, the factors influencing vehicle lateral placement can be divided into seven categories, but only four factors are considered {{to be the most important}} in this research: weather, visibility, horizontal curve, and traffic condition. To achieve this goal, a high resolution digital camera mounted on overpass is utilized to acquire lateral placement data under low and heavy traffic condition, during daytime and nighttime, in sunny, rainy, and windy weather, and at five different locations on an interstate highway. Based on the collected data, statistical methods are utilized to investigate the influence of the four factors on the lateral displacement distribution of truck wheels. Herein, the ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) test was applied to rank the effects of four factors on wheel shift, and the Phillips-Perron test (pp. test) was employed to check the stability of data. Subsequently, an approach is proposed to analyze the lateral position data with different parameters. A new analysis model called Multi-Factor Traffic Lateral Position (M-FTLP) is developed in the research to compute the frequency distribution of wheel-path wandering at different deviation levels. The M-FTLP model exploits local information (index weight) to determine lateral distribution of truck positions at a particular location.

40|$|Most Australian roads have {{experienced}} potholes {{and other types}} of pavement failures. An excessive amount of moisture in road pavements is often a major contributing factor to these pavement failures. Queensland has a very large road network connecting rural with urban and dense populations with sparse populations. This project seeks to investigate the penetration of water into road pavements due to the compounding nature of traffic. This project will determine if moisture enters the pavement through the compounding nature of traffic and quantify the extent of the problem. In Australia sprayed seal surfacing are used on most rural, arterial and rural local roads. Tyre pressures, traffic volumes, speed, loads and the amount of heavy vehicles have increased dramatically over time. This has led to an increase in pavement failures particularly in the wheel paths. An obvious cause of these failures is excessive amounts of moisture in these failure zones. Data provided by Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads – Toowoomba and samples that were collected were analysed. As a result of this analysis it was found that there was more moisture in the wheel paths compared to between the wheel paths. Although the majority of locations had higher moisture content in the outer <b>wheel</b> <b>path</b> than the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>path,</b> infiltration through the shoulder was an unlikely cause due to the moisture content in the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>path</b> shoulder being less than that of the outer <b>wheel</b> <b>path</b> in some cases. It is also evident that the more re-seals there were, the less moisture content there was within the pavement. The results of the permeameter tests revealed that spray seals are classed as ‘permeable’ under atmospheric pressure. Under pressure at the same locations the classification increases to ‘moderately free draining’. This indicates that under more realistic traffic conditions, moisture does penetrate spray seals.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop models for predicting the cumulative applications to the initiation of cracking for flexible pavements and to develop models for predicting crack propagation in flexible pavements. Crack initiation was defined as the first appearance of cracking in the <b>wheel</b> <b>paths.</b> The models are aimed for use in Pavement Management Systems. Data used in the study consisted of data from a Swedish LTPP study where over 600 test sections have been monitored during more than ten years. Every year a detailed distress survey, measurements of rut depth and the longitudinal profile have been carried out at each test section. The database contains information about traffic, climate, pavement structure, surface condition and structural strength. Pavement response based explanatory factors included, among other things, tensile strain at the bottom of the asphalt layer and other deflection based factors (i. e. surface curvature index, curvature basin factor, bearing capacity). The modelling of crack initiation models was carried out using a survival analysis approach. The modelling of crack propagation models was carried out using linear regression analysis. From the data, describing the yearly development of cracks, a Cracking Index was calculated. The same approach of developing crack models was used in the PARIS (Performance analysis of road infrastructure) project carried out within the 4 th European Framework Programme Road Transport 1996 - 1998. Models were successfully developed to predict the cumulative number of traffic loading to the initiation of cracking in the <b>wheel</b> <b>paths.</b> The models included two independent variables to pavement response and ageing (a relationship between a response variable and the annual cumulative number of traffic loading). As response variables Surface Curvature Index 300 or Tensile Strain at the bottom of the asphalt layer can be used in the crack initiation models. Models were also developed to predict crack propagation in the <b>wheel</b> <b>paths.</b> For any given section of road, the slope of the linear model can be estimated from the level of distress at the last distress survey and the age of the pavement surface or the number of ESALs carried by the pavement at that time.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study of alternate pavement designs targeted at reducing the initial construction costs of concrete pavements without compromising pavement performance. Test sections were constructed with alternate dowel materials, reduced dowel placements, variable thickness concrete slabs and alternate surface and subsurface drainage details. Performance data was collected out to 5 and 7 years after construction. The study results indicate that FRP composite dowels may not be a practical alternative to conventional epoxy coated steel dowels due to their reduced rigidity, which results in lower deflection load transfer capacities at transverse joints. Ride quality measures also indicate higher IRI values on sections constructed with FRP composite dowels. Study results for sections constructed with reduced placements of solid stainless steel dowels also indicate reduced load transfer capacity and increased IRI values as compared to similarly designed sections incorporating epoxy coated dowels. Reduced doweling in the driving lane <b>wheel</b> <b>paths</b> also is shown to be detrimental to performance for most constructed test sections. The performance of sections with reduced doweling in the passing lane <b>wheel</b> <b>paths</b> indicates that this alternate may be justifiable to maintain performance trends similar to those exhibited by the driving lane with standard dowel placements. Performance data from sections constructed with variable slab geometry and drainage designs indicate that one-way surface and base drainage designs are performing as well or better than standard crowned pavements with two-way base drainage.

The slots that the dowels were installed in were created by parallel saw cuts and a jackhammer to remove the concrete.

A common practice is for designers to place dowel bars at a certain, consistent spacing such that {{a sufficient number}} of dowels are available to effectively transfer anticipated loads. In many cases, however, the standards developed today for new highway construction simply do not reflect the design needs of low traffic volume, rural roads. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of the number of dowel bars and dowel location on joint performance and ultimately on pavement performance.

The performance potential of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical dowels placed in the <b>wheel</b> <b>paths</b> only was also evaluated on the same project. The second project compared corrosion resistant dowel bar (stainless steel and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) dowel bars) performance to round 1. 5 inch epoxy-coated steel dowel bars. The stainless steel and GFRP bars are for possible use in environments where steel corrosion may be an issue. Performance data was measured on both projects in terms of deflections, using falling weight deflectometer (FWD) data collected biannually. Joint faulting data was collected over the five-year test period for both projects. Roughness data was collected for only the elliptical dowel bar project over the five-year test period. Resilient modulus values were found by triaxial testing of the pavement subgrade samples. Performance criteria graphed verses resilient modulus allowed for the comparison of different dowels as the subgrade resilient modulus changed. The elliptical dowel bar study indicated medium elliptical dowel bars at 12 inch or 15 inch spacing perform equally to the standard 1. 5 inch round dowel bars at 12 inch spacing. The elliptical study also indicated the potential use of medium elliptical dowel bars in <b>wheel</b> <b>paths</b> only.
