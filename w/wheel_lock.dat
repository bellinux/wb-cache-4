25|$|Since initial {{widespread}} use in production cars, anti-lock braking {{systems have been}} improved considerably. Recent versions not only prevent <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> under braking, but also electronically control the front-to-rear brake bias. This function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known as electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), traction control system, emergency brake assist, or electronic stability control (ESC).|$|E
25|$|A wheellock, wheel-lock or <b>wheel</b> <b>lock,</b> is a friction-wheel {{mechanism}} {{to cause a}} spark for firing a firearm. It was the next major development in firearms technology after the matchlock and the first self-igniting firearm. Its name is from its rotating steel wheel to provide ignition. Developed around 1500, it was used alongside the matchlock and was later superseded by the snaplock (1540s), the snaphance (1560s) and the flintlock (c. 1600).|$|E

25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending <b>wheel</b> <b>lock,</b> it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
500|$|Development {{began in}} 1993, {{just after the}} release of the Mega Drive version of the first game. The release date was set at November 1994, and, {{according}} to Williamson, there was pressure to meet it. Early decisions focused on vehicle physics such as heavier vehicles being slow. According to Williamson, slow vehicles were considered [...] "boring" [...] and that the team [...] "made the game for ourselves". He stated that the team wanted more variety and depth than the original, so variables such as tyre friction and <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> were programmed to modify the behaviours of the vehicles. These additions increased the size of the game to double that of the original, but compression techniques were used to avoid the need for high capacity storage. This also allowed the production of the J-Cart, enabling four controllers to be plugged in without extra hardware. Williamson believed that increasing the number of players would make the game more fun, and stated that the J-Cart {{played a major role in}} establishing it as a [...] "party game". David and Richard Darling came up with the idea of the J-Cart. Although not initially involved with it, Supersonic Software's team were excited on hearing about the J-Cart because they thought it had potential. Richard was also the project manager, and visited Supersonic Software's offices weekly. His primary concern was how much fun the game was. David also thought of the idea of players sharing controllers, increasing the total number of players supported to eight. Williamson said that the team were not concerned with the difficulty increasing too quickly, or having a target audience.|$|E
2500|$|Slippery rail is also {{a problem}} in the Netherlands, {{addressed}} by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) and ProRail. To prevent <b>wheel</b> <b>lock,</b> on some routes trains are required to brake earlier and accelerate more slowly. Furthermore, some (passenger) trains are fitted with equipment to apply Sandite gel on the tracks. In autumn 2016, nearly [...] of this gel was applied on the Dutch railway network. In the fall of 2014 a pilot, in collaboration with Delft University of Technology, to use lasers to remove contaminations was announced by NS and ProRail.|$|E

40|$|In {{maturing}} rats, {{the growth}} of abdominal fat is attenuated by voluntary wheel running. After the cessation of running by <b>wheel</b> <b>locking,</b> a rapid increase in adipose tissue growth to a size {{that is similar to}} rats that have never run (i. e. catch-up growth) has been previously reported by our lab. In contrast, diet-induced increases in adiposity have a slower onset with relatively delayed transcriptomic responses. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify molecular pathways associated with the rapid increase in adipose tissue after ending 6 wks of voluntary running at the time of puberty. Age-matched, male Wistar rats were given access to running wheels from 4 to 10 weeks of age. From the 10 th to 11 th week of age, one group of rats had continued wheel access, while the other group had one week of <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> Perirenal adipose tissue was extracted, RNA sequencing was performed, and bioinformatics analyses were executed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA was chosen to assist in the understanding of complex 'omics data by integrating data into networks and pathways. <b>Wheel</b> <b>locked</b> rats gained significantly more fat mass and significantly increased body fat percentage between weeks 10 - 11 despite having decreased food intake, as compared to rats with continued wheel access. IPA identified 646 known transcripts differentially expressed (p < 0. 05) between continued wheel access and <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> In <b>wheel</b> <b>locked</b> rats, IPA revealed enrichment of transcripts for the following functions: extracellular matrix, macrophage infiltration, immunity, and pro-inflammatory. These findings suggest that increases in visceral adipose tissue that accompanies the cessation of pubertal physical activity are associated with the alteration of multiple pathways, some of which may potentiate the development of pubertal obesity and obesity-associated systemic low-grade inflammation that occurs later in life...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{production}} model, the Sea Fury F Mk X (Fighter, Mk 10), flew in September 1946. With {{the completion}} of flight testing at Boscombe Down in 1946, the trials process was repeated aboard the aircraft carrier [...] Carrier testing revealed directional stability issues related to rudder effectiveness during landing, and this was resolved by {{the adoption of a}} tail <b>wheel</b> <b>lock,</b> which also improved the wheel retraction behaviour. Several rectifying design changes were made by Hawker in response to feedback from the test pilots, including the adoption of a five-bladed Rotol propeller to greatly reduce overspeed tendencies, a re-designed rudder assembly to increase rudder effectiveness, Dynafocal engine mountings to reduce vibration at low speeds, and an improved undercarriage with greater flexibility; these changes greatly improved the aircraft's deck landing characteristics. Arrestor hook trials initially revealed the Sea Fury to be prone to missing the wires, this was rapidly resolved by modifications to the hook dampener mechanism.|$|E

50|$|By {{interpreting}} {{the speed and}} force with which the brake pedal is pushed, the system detects if the driver is trying to execute an emergency stop, and if the brake pedal is not fully applied, the system overrides and fully applies the brakes until the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) takes over to stop the <b>wheels</b> <b>locking</b> up.|$|R
40|$|Through an {{application}} to automotive engineering, this demonstration illustrates that {{the coefficient of}} static friction is greater than the coefficient of sliding friction. A toy car with either its front or its rear <b>wheels</b> <b>locked</b> is allowed to slide down an inclined plane. If either the car's front or its rear <b>wheels</b> are <b>locked,</b> that pair will slide, while the other pair rolls. Because the coefficient of rolling friction is greater than that of sliding, the pair that are rolling, and therefore have greater friction with the board, will lag behind. This demonstration illustrates why it is necessary to provide most of the braking for a car at the front wheels...|$|R
50|$|In {{a parking}} situation, the {{computer}} varies the ratio {{so that the}} steering wheel needs fewer than two full turns to move the <b>wheels</b> <b>lock</b> to lock.
