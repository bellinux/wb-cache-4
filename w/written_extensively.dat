5|$|Author Raven Grimassi has <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, {{presenting}} what {{he admits}} {{is his own}} personal rendering of her story. He differs from Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than a goddess.|$|E
5|$|John's coup was <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> {{about by}} contemporaries: the {{historian}} Niketas Choniates deals with it briefly and rather dismissively, but Nicholas Mesarites left a long eyewitness account of events, {{in which his}} own role is suitably emphasized. The scholars Nikephoros Chrysoberges and Euthymios Tornikes wrote speeches in celebration of the coup's failure.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E

5|$|Phallus calongei was {{discovered}} on June 16, 2008, near the Khanspur stream in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly {{known as the}} North Western Frontier Province) in Pakistan. It was described as new to science in a 2009 Mycotaxon publication. The specific epithet calongei honors Spanish mycologist Francisco D. Calonge who has <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> on the Gasteromycetes, and who has himself published or co-published three Phallus species: P.atrovolvatus (Kreisel & Calonge), P.maderensis (Calonge) and P.minusculus (Kreisel & Calonge). P.calongei {{is one of four}} Phallus species known to exist in Pakistan, the others being P.celebicus, P.impudicus, and P.rubicundus.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E
