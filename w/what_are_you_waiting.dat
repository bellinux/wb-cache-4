2500|$|The story {{revolves}} around Leonardo da Vinci's mysterious disappearance {{in the year}} 1506. Ezio arrives at Leonardo's workshop with his assistant Salaì and finds him missing. It is soon revealed that Leonardo found a secret vault and his plans were discovered by the Hermetics, members of the Cult of Hermes. Ezio finds writing on the floor that implies he should seek out five of Leonardo's paintings once owned by Ezio at Monteriggioni but now missing. The majority of this sequence focuses on the search for and retrieval of these paintings by Ezio. After finding these paintings, Ezio identifies {{the location of a}} new subterranean location in Roma and proceeds there, to find Da Vinci imprisoned by Hermetics. After freeing Leonardo, the two of them find another vault, in which they are revealed the numbers 43 39 19 N and 75 27 42 W. Ezio comments on these numbers [...] "It is not intended for us". At the end of the sequence, two male voices (one is the Assassin, William) are heard commenting that Desmond has fallen into a coma. They also comment [...] "we have a location for the temple" [...] and [...] "then <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>waiting</b> for, let's go."

5000|$|In late 2004, Rai {{garnered}} {{international recognition}} for her starring role opposite Martin Henderson in Gurinder Chadha's British film Bride and Prejudice, a Bollywood-style adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice. International film critics expressed mixed views on Rai's {{performance as the}} Punjabi version of Elizabeth Bennet; a review carried by The New York Times mentioned her as [...] "radiantly beautiful but inert", while Rolling Stone noted that [...] "she is a world-class hottie with talent to match, as she proves in her first English-speaking role". With a worldwide gross of $24 million against a production budget of $7 million, Bride and Prejudice proved a commercial success. Rai next collaborated with director Rituparno Ghosh, for the second time, in the relationship drama Raincoat, an adaptation of O. Henry's The Gift of the Magi. Also featuring Ajay Devgan, Raincoat met with wide critical acclaim and among other wins, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. The Hindu noted, [...] "As Neerja, Rai appears to have shed her inhibitions about looking unglamorous. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> more, {{she seems to have}} made an earnest effort to emote, using less of her body and limbs and more of her face, and eyes in particular". She eventually received another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.Rai next co-starred alongside Sanjay Dutt and Zayed Khan in the 2005 adult drama Shabd, which tells the story of an author who convinces his wife to pursue an illicit relationship with a younger man in research for his next book. The film received predominantly negative reviews and proved a commercial failure. The Times of India concluded, [...] "For the umpteenth time, Ms Rai looks drop-dead gorgeous. And that's about it. She is like that picture postcard you get when <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> actually <b>waiting</b> for is a letter. It's very beautiful to look at, but is of no use because it says nothing."That same year, Rai took on the lead role of Tilo in Paul Mayeda Berges's romantic fantasy film The Mistress of Spices, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. The film received negative reviews from film critics and emerged as a commercial failure. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian termed Rai's performance as [...] "annoying" [...] and wrote that she [...] "wafts and simpers" [...] through the entire film. Rai's only successful venture of 2005 was a special appearance in Shaad Ali's comedy Bunty Aur Babli, in which she featured in the popular item number Kajra Re.|$|R
