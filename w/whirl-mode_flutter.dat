Increased power, thrust, and efficiency are not enough: the whirl-mode stability boundary must also be improved. With current technology, very stiff, thick wings of limited aspect ratio are essential to meet the stability requirements, which severely limits cruise efficiency and maximum speed. Larger and more efficient tiltrotors will need longer and lighter wings, for which <b>whirl-mode</b> <b>flutter</b> is a serious design issue. Numerous approaches to improving the whirl-mode airspeed boundary have been investigated, typically focusing on wing design, active stability augmentation, and variable geometry rotors. The research reported herein applies the much simpler approach of sweeping the outboard blade sections. The effects-of control-system stiffness were also studied.

Larger and more efficient tiltrotors will need longer and lighter wings, for which <b>whirl-mode</b> <b>flutter</b> is a serious design issue. Numerous approaches to improving the whirl-mode airspeed boundary have been investigated, including tailored stiffness wings, active stability augmentation, variable geometry rotors, highly swept tips, and at one extreme, folding rotors. The research reported herein began with the much simpler approach of adjusting the chordwise positions of the rotor blade aerodynamic center and center of gravity, effected by offsetting the airfoil quarter chord or structural mass {{with respect to the}} elastic axis. The research was recently extended to include variations in blade sweep, control system stiffness, and pitch-flap coupling (delta(sub 3)). As an introduction to the subject, and to establish a baseline against which to measure stability improvements, this report will first summarize results. The paper will then discuss more advanced studies of swept blades and control-system modifications...|$|E

Numerous approaches to improving the whirl-mode airspeed boundary have been investigated, typically focusing on wing design, active stability augmentation, and variable geometry rotors. The research to be reported applies the much simpler approaches of sweeping the outboard blade sections and extending balance weights at the tip. Improving proprotor whirl-mode stability margins is an ongoing research activity at NASA Ames Research Center. Previous efforts focussed on the XV- 15 rotor. This is the first application of these design principles to a full V- 22 rotor model in CAMRAD II (a previous publication presented results for a preliminary analytical model). The analysis to {{be discussed in the}} proposed paper includes a dual load-path blade model, a compressible-flow aerodynamic model, a representation of swashplate/rotor modal coupling, and other new features. The paper will include discussions of the mechanisms by which blade sweep and tip-mass offsets improve whirl-flutter margins. The V- 22 was modeled with CAMRAD II; the rotor model is shown. It is also shows an example swept blade derived from the V- 22 rotor system. For this rotor, the primary significance of sweep is the improved whirl-flutter boundary, not the reduced Mach-number effects. An offset tip mass is also shown...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{new class of}} aircraft - the Advanced Theater Transport (ATT) will combine strategic range and high payload with 'Super-STOL' (short take-off and landing) capability. It is also proposed to modify a YC- 15 into a technology demonstrator with a 20 -deg tilt wing; four, eight-bladed propellers; cross-shafted gearboxes and V- 22 engines. These constitute a unique combination of design features that potentially affect performance, loads and <b>whirl-mode</b> stability (whirl <b>flutter).</b> NASA Ames Research Center is working with Boeing and Hamilton Sundstrand on technology challenges presented by the concept; the purpose of NASA involvement is to establish requirements for the demonstrator and for early design guidance, with emphasis on whirl flutter. CAMRAD II {{is being used to}} study the effects of various design features on whirl flutter, with special attention to areas where such features differ from existing aircraft, notably tiltrotors. Although the stability margins appear to be more than adequate, the concept requires significantly different analytical methods, principally including far more blade modes, than typically used for tiltrotors...|$|R
