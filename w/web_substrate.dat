50|$|When {{selecting}} packaging films (<b>web</b> <b>substrates)</b> for EMAP {{of fruits}} and vegetables the main characteristics to consider are gas permeability, water vapour transmission rate, mechanical properties, transparency, type of package and sealing reliability. Traditionally used packaging films like LDPE (low-density polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) and OPP (oriented polypropylene) are not permeable enough for highly respiring products like fresh-cut produce, mushrooms and broccoli. As fruits and vegetables are respiring products, {{there is a need to}} transmit gases through the film. Films designed with these properties are called permeable films. Other films, called barrier films, are designed to prevent the exchange of gases and are mainly used with non-respiring products like meat and fish.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{coating of}} <b>web</b> <b>substrates</b> is usually {{accomplished}} by using {{various forms of}} liquid coating. While appropriate for many applications, liquid methods often involve the use of hazardous solvents reaqmring special EPA per-mits. In addition, certain coatings and specific performance features cannot be at-tained when using liquid coatings. For these instances an alternate method of application {{can be accomplished by}} powder deposition. This paper will introduce an existing coating technology, the Electrostatic Flui-dized Bed, and describe how its use is appropriate for applying coatings to web sub-strates. The process will be explained and its advantages will be examined. Finally, examples of actual applications will be provided to show how the process is used to solve coating problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Transparent {{conducting}} oxide (TCO) {{is one of}} the {{key components}} in photovoltaic and display applications. One candidate to replace indium tin oxide as TCO material is tin oxide. It is stable at high temperature, economical to produce and more benign compared to other TCO materials. The bulk resistivity of tin oxide films deposited with conventional methods (PECVD, spray pyrolysis, atmospheric pressure CVD) reaches as low as 5 x 10 - 4 Ohm-cm. However, the deposition temperature is typically above 350 °C which limits temperature sensitive processes such as quantum dots based solar cells or large area plastic substrates. We developed a novel PECVD system to deposit tin oxide at lower temperature (below 130 °C) while achieving good conductivity. Our tin oxide films have bulk resistivity of 2. 18 x 10 - 3 Ohm-cm at 130 °C which is lower than conventionally deposited films at the same process temperature. Furthermore, the linear PECVD source used in this process is scalable to several meter-wide <b>web</b> <b>substrates</b> with film uniformity better than 3 %. The deposition rate is typically 200 - 300 nm-meter/minute.

40|$|Theoretically, the {{functional}} traits of native species should determine how natives respond to invader-driven changes. To explore this idea, we simulated a large-scale plant invasion using dead spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) stems {{to determine if}} native spiders' web-building behaviors could explain differences in spider population responses to structural changes arising from C. stoebe invasion. After two years, irregular web-spiders were > 30 times more abundant and orb weavers were > 23 times more abundant on simulated invasion plots compared to controls. Additionally, irregular web-spiders on simulated invasion plots built webs that were 4. 4 times larger and 5. 0 {{times more likely to}} capture prey, leading to > 2 -fold increases in recruitment. Orb-weavers showed no differences in web size or prey captures between treatments. Web-spider responses to simulated invasion mimicked patterns following natural invasions, confirming that C. stoebe's architecture is likely the primary attribute driving native spider responses to these invasions. Differences in spider responses were attributable to differences in web construction behaviors relative to historic <b>web</b> <b>substrate</b> constraints. Orb-weavers in this system constructed webs between multiple plants, so they were limited by the overall quantity of native substrates but not by the architecture of individual native plant species. Irregular web-spiders built their webs within individual plants and were greatly constrained by the diminutive architecture of native plant substrates, so they were limited both by quantity and quality of native substrates. Evaluating native species traits in the context of invader-driven change can explain invasion outcomes and help to identify factors limiting native populations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACX Coating and Laminating offer a {{wide variety}} of methods by which one can process textile and film webs for various end uses. Choosing the best method is often {{dictated}} by the materials to be processed, the coating, the required properties of the finished product, and the cost-effectiveness of manufacture. A best syztcm is ultimately the one that gives you the product you want, manufactured by the most economical mcthod. To better determine a best way, one must know the various coating and laminating methods and understand the key principles o f their operation. This presentation reviews those methods and gives some of their special features. Coating is usually divided into three (3) major categories, namely, knife, roll, and speciality coating. Within each of these categories arc variations that should allow a manufacturer to select the best method by which to achieve the end product. Lamination can be either an adjunct to the coating process, or a separate process combining already existing webs. In the former, a laminate web can be bonded to a coated substrate as part of the coating process. In the latter, separate webs are com-bined either by using an adhesive or through thermal bonding.

40|$|Drying {{processes}} {{have been}} {{with us for a}} long time. During the Roman Empire, for example, the sun was used as a heat source in the convective drying of bricks, while during the industrial revolution, moist ceramic products were carried into and out of steam heated rooms by child labourers since it was deemed more cost effective to maintain a constant room temperature than to cool the room down in order to remove the products in a safe and healthy manner. Drying is the removal of volatile substances (moisture) by heat from a mixture that yields a solid product [1]. The volatile substances or solvents used in the coating process can range from simple to handle materials such as water to active organic materials where the active ingredients may be polymers, binders, dyes, hardeners etc. The heat supplied during the drying process vaporizes the solvent and the solvent removal must be performed without adversely affecting the coating formulation or interfering with the physical uniformity of the coating. Note that although drying may involve solvent removal, chemical reactions may also aid solidification and it is possible also to accelerate solidification by using a catalyst or an outside energy source such as ultra-violet radiation. This is also called curing to differentiate it from drying although most coatings experience some form of reaction in the dryer. From Keey [1] it may be observed that drying processes for web type substrates can be categorised into conduction, radiation and convection style processes. Conduction processes are characterised by high levels of solid contact and the subsequent high material temperatures associated with this contact. Radiation style processes are generally limited to the drying of thin films as impinging radiation rarely penetrates beyond the immediate surface of a material. The most efficient and hence most frequently implemented drying method is based on convective drying. In this method a carrier gas is heated before being passed over or through the wet material. The convective method is the only method to simultaneously increase the heat transfer coefficient and the mass transfer coefficient [2]. This paper focuses on the convective style of drying. The following figure shows a schematic of two popular air convection drying processes. Figure 1 (a) shows a typical air impingement drying process [3] where hot air jets pass over a coated film and transfer heat into the coating to vaporize the solvent. Figure 1 (b) shows a schematic of a air floatation dryer [4], which is used to support webs on an air cushion, thereby avoiding possible damage to the <b>web</b> <b>substrate.</b> Figure 1 : Schematic diagrams of (a) air impingement and (b) air floatation drying processes [3, 4]. Although most coatings are applied in the fluid state, they are used in the dried state. Thus the drying process {{is as important as the}} coating process since it may either improve or degrade the properties of the coating. In practice, drying is also important since it may restrict the optimisation of a coating process since in drying sensitive applications drying considerations may dominate over coating ones in limiting possible line speeds. Drying must be performed without adversely affecting the coating formulation or interfering with the physical uniformity of the coating [5]...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a fabrication process for amorphous-silicon thin-film transistors (a-Si:H TFTs) on free-standing clear plastic substrates at temperatures up to 300 oC. The 300 oC fabrication process is made possible by using a unique clear plastic substrate that has a very low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE < 10 ppm/oC) and a glass transition temperature higher than 300 oC. Our TFTs have a conventional inverted-staggered gate back-channel passivated geometry, which we designed to achieve two goals: accurate overlay alignment and a high effective mobility. A requirement that becomes particularly difficult to meet in the making of TFT backplanes on plastic foil at 300 oC is minimizing overlay misalignment. Even though we use a substrate that has a relatively low CTE, accurately aligning the TFTs on the free-standing, 70 -micrometer thick substrate is challenging. To deal with this immediate challenge, and to continue developing processes for free-standing <b>web</b> <b>substrates,</b> we are introducing techniques for self-alignment to our TFT fabrication process. We have self-aligned the channel to the gate by exposing through the clear plastic substrate. To raise the effective mobility of our TFTs we reduced the series resistance by decreasing the thickness of the amorphous silicon layer between the source-drain contacts and the accumulation layer in the channel. The back-channel passivated structure allows us to decrease the thickness of the a-Si:H active layer down to around 20 nm.

The aim {{of the work is}} to demonstrate the ability to create all-evaporated transistors, exploiting the kind of technologies at present extensively used in the food packaging industry, for example, in which all layers can be deposited at high web speeds. Ours is a room temperature and a solvent-free method with an ultrahigh deposition rate (web speeds in excess of 100 m/min are possible). The performance of the pentacene and the polymer dielectric materials within devices was investigated, demonstrating (1) the ability to deposit good quality pentacene layers in the roll-to-roll environment and (2) the importance of the e-beam curing conditions of the dielectric layer on the performance of the organic FET devices. This deposition route creates a smooth, pin-hole-free dielectric layer as it is deposited onto the substrate as a monomeric liquid, before curing, and there is no mass-loss such as in solvent-based deposition processes. These devices have a 250 μm channel length and an aspect ratio of 16. No self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or other surface modification had been applied to the insulator layer to achieve these properties. The tuning of the transistors' operating voltage and output characteristics was feasible through the ease of control of the polymer dielectric thickness achieving a threshold voltage of less than 10 V. On/off ratio in excess of 10 3, and mobility = 0. 1 cm 2 V - 1 S - 1 have been achieved. The ability to integrate such a high deposition rate polymer process, into a single step, multilayer, vacuum deposition process with conventional vacuum deposition sources provides a possible route to low cost and large area electronic device processing. © 2011 Materials Research Society...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Combining high {{strength}} and elasticity, spider silks are exceptionally tough, i. e., able to absorb massive kinetic energy before breaking. Spider silk {{is therefore a}} model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers. There are over 41, 000 described species of spiders, most spinning multiple types of silk. Thus we have available some 200, 000 + unique silks that may cover an amazing breadth of material properties. To date, however, silks from only a few tens of species have been characterized, most chosen haphazardly as model organisms (Nephila) or simply from researchers' backyards. Are we limited to 'blindly fishing' in efforts to discover extraordinary silks? Or, could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties? METHODOLOGY: We examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy 'Darwin's bark spider' (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2. 8 m(2)) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the <b>web</b> to <b>substrates</b> on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m(3), with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m(3). Thus, C. darwini silk {{is more than twice}} tougher than any previously described silk, and over 10 times better than Kevlar®. Caerostris capture spiral silk is similarly exceptionally tough. CONCLUSIONS: Caerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial. We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history-informed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry...|$|R

The nanodimension of these particles brings several disadvantages, among them being the negative impact on human health, which is a widely discussed topic nowadays. The nanoparticles can permeate through living tissue and enter living cells and thus a strong effort focused on diminishing this problem is the subject of research activities by many groups. One possible way to achieve control of the nanoparticles' mobility is capturing them on the surface of suitable particulate carriers with dimensions on the order of tenths and hundredths of microns whereas this approach leads to formation of new composite material. Clay minerals, silicates, carbonaceous materials, and other particulate matter are intensively studied for these purposes and proper selection of the substrate can bring additional functionality to the final composite. Very often the photoactivity, antibacterial properties, electrical conductivity, and other properties are significantly enhanced in the case of this kind of composite materials.

Thus, this paper examined the conformation of single polymer chain in coating bead regime of slot coating by combining Brownian dynamics (BD) with the conventional computational flow dynamics (CFD) simulations. Recent developments in direct visualization methods, coupled with Brownian dynamics simulations, have allowed the dynamics of single DNA molecules in flow fields to be studied with unprecedented details (Larson, 2005; Shaqfeh, 2005).

Or, could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties? Methodology We examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy ‘Darwin's bark spider’ (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2. 8 m 2) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the <b>web</b> to <b>substrates</b> on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m 3, with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m 3. Thus, C. darwini silk {{is more than twice}} tougher than any previously described silk, and over 10 times better than Kevlar®. Caerostris capture spiral silk is similarly exceptionally tough. Conclusions Caerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial. We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history–informed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry.

40|$|Nanofibers or nanowebs {{produced}} by electrospinning have several prominent properties {{such as high}} surface area to volume ratio, high porosity and pore size in nanorange. As the porosity of electrospun nanoweb is more than 90 %, they are candidates for air filters and liquid filtration membranes. However, the application of electrospun nanofibers membranes {{has yet to make}} breakthrough in other avenues of separation than air filtration, especially in pressure-driven liquid separations, such as ultrafiltration (UF) or nanofiltration (NF). In this project, the preparation of polyethersulfone (PES) membranes by electrospinning was studied. The influence of processing parameters, i. e., polymer concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, spinneret-to-collector distance, relative humidity, were investigated. The treatment of the proto-membrane formed by immersion in an aqueous coagulation bath was also studied. More comprehensive characterizations of the nanofiber membranes, including fiber diameter, pore size, porosity, thickness, basic weight and tensile strength as well as air and water permeability were investigated. Thereby, we expect that this work will open up the avenue toward the use of nanofibers for very important applications of separation technology. Of particular interest are membranes in water purification, e. g., pre-filters to minimize contaminations and fouling prior to ultra- or nano-filtration. PES (Ultrason 6020 P) was dissolved in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) at concentrations of 9 %, 15 %, 22 %. The polymer solution was electrospun under processing conditions i. e., a spinneret-to-collector distance of 10 cm, an applied voltage of 30 kV, a flow rate of 20 μL/min, and a spinneret diameter of 0. 8 mm, stationary substrate set-up, aluminum foil and PET nonwoven served as the substrate. The first results showed that the 22 % PES solution can be electrospun into well-defined nanofiber. The overall morphology of the membranes obtained is changed from a fiber network into spherical particles connected by fibers with the decrease of the polymer concentration in the solution used for electrospinning. The properties of nanofiber can be measured on aluminum foil or PET nonwoven as substrate. Image analyses gave a mean fiber diameter of 489 ± 142 nm but under stationary spinning conditions that leads to a 3 dimensional fiber <b>web</b> on the <b>substrate.</b> When the 22 % PES solution was electrospun membrane using a moving substrate under processing conditions i. e., applied voltage of 18 kV, a spinneret-to-collector distance of 10 cm, a flow rate of 20 μL/min, a spinneret diameter of 0. 8 mm, a speed of substrates moving of 2. 2 cm/min, 65 % RH and served the PET nonwoven as substrate, yielded a more planar and homogeneous membrane. The thickness of membrane was 200 μm. The image analyses gave a mean fiber diameter of 800 nm. However, the proto-membrane which had been treated by immersion into the water bath lead to a pronounced porosity on the nanofiber surface which will be useful, for instance, for increasing binding capacity to the fiber surface. In addition, the membranes which had been electrospun under processing condition at high humidity resulted in irregular fiber formation. All test results for membranes showed that the fiber diameter and membrane structure and, consequently, membranes properties were clearly affected by applied voltage and spinneret-to-collector distance. The electrospun membrane was prepared by an applied voltage 18 kV at distance spinneret-to-collector of 10 cm, a flow rate of 20 μL/min, a spinneret diameter of 0. 8 mm, a speed of substrates moving of 2. 2 cm/min, 65 % RH and served the PET nonwoven as substrate exhibited the pore size of 1. 8 μm, the porosity of 93 % and basic weight of 0. 169 mg/cm 2. All membranes showed similar and high contact angle. The electrospun membranes prepared by applying higher voltage have lower flux than membranes prepared with lower voltage. The electrospun membranes which were prepared by increasing distance between spinneret-to-collector (kept other conditions) exhibited high water flux and clear correlation between structure and performance that decreasing of mean pore size leads to decreasing water flux of electrospun membranes. However the results suggested that PES electrospun nanofiber membranes are excellent materials for high water flux MF applications. Regarding nitrogen gas flow through electrospun membranes, the membranes which were prepared by increasing applied voltage showed decreasing gas permeability. Moreover with the DEHS aerosol, with particles size of 400 - 1000 nm, filtration performance of electrospun nanofiber web was much greater than that of the 4 layers commercial nonwoven (Novatexx 2429) with pore size of 8 μm. This result clearly demonstrated the potential of electrospun nanofiber in the development of filter material against aerosol nanoparticles. The filtrate fluxes of commercial membrane (Membrana MicroPES; pore size 1 μm) was much smaller than the filtrate fluxes of PES electrospun membrane with pore size ranging between 1. 7 - 4. 5 μm. Overall, PES electrospun membrane showed greater water flux than commercial membrane both before and after separation of silica nanoparticles (size 35 nm). The water flux before separation of all membrane was higher than after silica nanoparticles separation. The PES electrospun membranes had higher particles rejection than PES commercial membrane. Besides, the rejection of electrospun membranes was well above 90 %, while commercial membrane rejected the nanoparticles by only 85 % {{in the beginning of the}} filtration. Moreover, the PES electrospun membranes exhibited the rejection above 98 % at the end of rejection experiment run. Such the results showed, electrospun nanofiber PES membranes can be used in various applications such as removal of nano or microparticles from waste-water, e. g., pre-filters to minimize contaminations and fouling prior to UF or NF...|$|R
