40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the training of}} a recurrent neural network as the letter posterior probability estimator for a hidden Markov model, off-line handwriting recognition system. The network estimates posterior distributions for each {{of a series of}} frames representing sections of a handwritten word. The network is trained by backpropagation through time. The supervised training algorithm requires target outputs to be provided for each frame. Three methods for deriving these targets are presented. A novel method based upon the forward-backward algorithm is found to result in the recognizer with the lowest error rate. 1 Introduction In the field of off-line handwriting recognition, the goal is to read a handwritten document and produce a machine transcription. Such a system could be used for a variety of purposes, from cheque processing and postal sorting to personal correspondence reading for the blind or historical document reading.

In this paper we describe an effort within the OTC to improve the maintainability of AT&T's 4 ESSä switches, by optimizing the thresholding rules within the operation support system responsible for maintaining these switches. This optimization task required us to first identify the purpose of the thresholds, so that we could specify objective criteria for evaluating these thresholds. We then exhaustively searched the space of possible thresholds {{in order to determine the}} "best" strategies. One of our key discoveries is that the thresholding strategies, no matter what the threshold value, are relatively ineffective.

40|$|Stampede is a {{parallel}} programming system {{to facilitate the}} programming of interactive multimedia applications on clusters of SMPs. In a Stampede application, a variable number of threads can communicate data items to each other via channels, which are distributed, synchronized data structures containing timestamped data such as images from a video camera. Channels are not queue-like: threads may produce and consume items out of timestamp order; they may produce and consume items sparsely (skipping timestamps), and multiple threads (including newly created threads) may consume an item in a channel. These flexibilities are required due to the complex dynamic parallel structure of applications, to support increased parallelism, and because of real-time requirements. Under these circumstances, a key issue is the "garbage collection condition": When can an item in a channel be garbage collected?

40|$|We have {{measured}} the size {{effect on the}} contact resistance (R c) to shal low junctions in si l icon ut i l iz ing two di f ferent metal l izat ion systems. Rc(W), where W stands for the contact widths, is found to display a non- / quadratic dependence. Thus, our ex-I perimental observat ions show that the commonly used device scal ing theory which assumes that contact impedance increases inversely with {{the square of the}} scal ing factor is incorrect. In recent years use of the four-terminal Kelvin resistor test structure has been suggested in order to char-acterize the contact resistance of metal- to-semiconductor contacts. [I- 4] Such a structure, however, cannot yield unambiguous values of the con-tact resistance because, as depicted in Figure i, only a port ion of the contact carries the largest fraction of the total current. This situation is common to other methods of contact resistance measurement and was dis-cussed previously. [5] Nevertheless, the four-terminal Kelvin resistor contact structure [2] is very interest-ing because of its s imilar ity to actual device contacts. Also, this method of contact resistance measure-ment is part icular ly rel iable for a comparat ive study of di f ferent metal-l izat ions since it involves only one part icular contact area during the measurement.

For this reason, a lot o f research is cur rently being done to develop sys tems for Computer Aided Detect ion (CADe). Probably, some causes of the fa lse –negative screening examinat ions are that tumoral masses have varying dimension and ir regular shape, their borders a re o f ten i l l–defined and their contrast i s very lo w, thus making di fficult the discr imination from parenchymal structures.
