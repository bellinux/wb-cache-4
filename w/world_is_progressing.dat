Where you now see reform, progress, fulfilment of upward tendency, continual ascent by Man on the stepping stones of his dead selves to higher things, you will see nothing but an infinite comedy of illusion.

30|$|Theoretically, {{this article}} explores how policy and {{politics}} create social knowledge, and make some ideas publicly salient (Cox & Béland, 2013; Korkut et al. 2015; Searle, 2010). Discursive processes can enhance their resonance once they operate in conjunction with institutional mechanisms in political contexts, qualifying the subsequent social processes and power relations. Hence, talk in institutional settings can allude to the ‛interaction process in which what is “text” one moment becomes “con-text” the very next’ (Fairhurst, 2009, p. 1611; Iszatt-White, 2011, p. 123). In this sense, narratives serve the dual purpose of providing an explanation of events while allowing individual interpretation (Bruner, 1996). It is through explanation that an individual develops {{an understanding of how}} the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>progressing</b> and how he or she fits within the story of progression (Bruner, 1996; Patterson & Monroe, 1998). Political authority can impart an impact on this process via setting rules that do not just regulate, but also create the possibility of the very behaviour that they regulate (Searle, 2010). Essentially, discursive governance refers to implicit mechanisms of governance resting on narratives, leitmotifs and strategic metaphors in political language, and the subsequent framing of policies using such language to interpose ideas in order to affect political and social representations within the public sphere in accordance with the wishes of political authorities (Korkut et al., 2015).|$|E
30|$|Author has {{presented}} work in developing taxonomy {{in the field}} of repair technology as {{there is little or no}} work yet been done in this fashion. The question why this repair process taxonomy has been developed? The simple answer to this question is that taxonomy provides a complete understanding of the subject matter. Then again question arises, why there is a need to develop a thorough understanding of this repair process subject matter? The reason is that as <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>progressing</b> forward with new emerging technology in a competitive environment; customer is becoming the main focus of today’s company since through-life engineering has been evolved. So in mechanical field, the game is not finished by simply manufacturing the components and handed over to customer but now companies are providing services (repair) to an extended period of time to grasp customer attention, so in short companies have to be up to the mark, regarding repair services but the problem is that repairer and manufacturer are confused regarding applying of processes in context of repairing as well as in manufacturing so there is a need to draw a boundary line between repair process and manufacturing processes. Author is of the view that this problem can be solved by developing a repair process taxonomy. In developing taxonomy, literature review has been done that how different researcher have applied taxonomy to their subject matter. A very interesting thing is that taxonomy is a very liberal artifact. It is developed in a way a researcher or a user wants its subject matter classification to be. However, three approaches has been identified through literature review which different researcher applied to their objects of interest namely phenetic or numerical taxonomy, cladistics or and evolution taxonomy. The approach author followed is phenetic as author want to classify repair process on the basis of their characteristics but not on the basis of their evolutionary relationship. So a model designed to develop.|$|E

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} of the degree of Bachelor of Engineering. The development in the construction industry all over the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>progressing</b> day by day. High-tech and modernized designs are being built and old buildings are being demolished or renovated. One of the things builders, developers and contractors must consider during construction, renovation or demolition is where to put all the debris. When structures made of concrete are to be demolished, concrete recycling is an increasingly common method of disposing of the rubble. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to landfills for disposal, but recycling has a number of benefits that has made it more attractive option in this age of greater environmental awareness, more environmental laws, and the desire to keep construction costs down. In this study, we are aiming to design a concrete debris mixture as mortar mix that will meet the IS requirements, in order to help contribute to the industry in saving the environment, to encourage the government to find solutions regarding the disposal to landfills of waste materials and save the environment, to provide new knowledge to the contractors and developers on how to improve the construction industry methods and services by using recycled concrete debris, and to sustain good product performance and meet recycling goals. The objectives of this project are to prepare a mix design of M 20 grade concrete using concrete rubble from demolition site and admixture (super-plasticizer), to prepare a mix design of M 25 grade concrete using concrete rubble from demolition site and admixture (super-plasticizer), to carry out Slump Cone Test on the above mentioned concrete mixes, to carry out Compressive Strength Test on the above mentioned concrete mixes, to carry out different tests on recycled aggregates & natural aggregates & compare their results and to finally conclude the effectiveness of concrete recycling based on the above test result...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} to a globalised <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>progressing</b> rapidly, but the {{transition to}} a sustainable one is not. Globalisation and the environment are still 'worlds apart', as a title of a recent book says (Speth 2003). Therefore, I am grateful for the efforts undertaken to find answers {{to the question of how}} to reach globalisation of environmental management. I would like to start my presentation with four introductory remarks: 1. First of all, congratulations! The Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) stands for 25 years of imaginative and successful environmental research. That is quite a long period of time; that means quite some experience. I have seen many institutes and researchers coming during those years; quite a few of them then disappeared…Thanks, therefore, for inviting me to this special event; and let's start for another 25 years today! 2. International advertisements of the University of Leiden used to begin with a wonderful motive: 'The Universiteit Leiden never hesitates to push aside what is outdated or obsolete, yet values tradition and the attainments from the past. It often has to lead the way, and always takes a critical stance on fashion and trends'. I very much like that motive, and intend to make it my own. 3. The first speaker at a symposium or conference should never try to give all - or even the 'final' - answers to the questions asked by the organisers. Better leave that to the other speakers or the rapporteur. For today's event, and in view of the excellent speakers you invited, this old wisdom should hold all the more. Instead of giving final answers, I shall start with some observations and add a few more questions, before coming to some possible priorities on how to proceed with global environmental management. 4. The Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) obviously is fond of 'triangles' or 'three pillars' models'. The CML is doing work (1) on Environment and Development, (2) on Environmental Biology, and (3) on Industrial Ecology - one such triangle. Today’s symposium is also structured like a triangle or three pillars' model. The main question of the organisers was: Should environmental problems and globalisation of environmental management be approached in a supra-national, a multi-lateral and/or a private way? Are these three approaches complementary or competing?" (author's abstract) Der Verfasser diskutiert unterschiedliche Modelle von Global Governance auf dem Gebiet der Umweltpolitik. Dabei werden verschiedene Akteure wie Regierungen, Unternehmen und Zivilgesellschaft, verschiedene Ebenen (privat, multilateral, supranational) und räumliche Dimensionen (lokal, regional, global) sowie Fragen der Nachhaltigkeit berücksichtigt. Es schließen sich Überlegungen zu internationalen umweltpolitischen Strategien auf dem Weg zu "Global Environmental Governance" an. In diesem Zusammenhang werden auch institutionelle Faktoren, Fragen der Verhandlungsstrategie und Probleme der Konfliktlösung angesprochen. (ICE...|$|E

40|$|The {{epidemic}} of diphtheria in the Newly Independent States (NIS) {{of the former}} Soviet Union has drawn attention to our incomplete understanding of the epidemiology of diph-theria. Many unanswered questions remain concerning the reasons for a resurgence of diph-theria and for the shift {{in the age of}} patients and concerning the mechanisms for acquisition of immunity in adults through natural infection under unfavorable living conditions. Other unanswered questions relate to the precise role of socioeconomic factors and hygiene con-ditions in the initiation, buildup, and spread of the epidemic. Important characteristics of the NIS epidemic can be used to help predict the spread of future diphtheria epidemics. These characteristics include a high proportion of infected adults, a progressive spread of disease from urban centers to rural areas, and transition from initial ampli®cation of disease in groups with high rates of close contacts in focalized, well-distinguished outbreaks to a more gener-alized epidemic. At the beginning of the 1980 s, many countries in the <b>world</b> <b>were</b> <b>progressing</b> toward the elimination of diphtheria. Diph-theria incidence rates reached their lowest levels, and there was optimism that elimination of indigenous respiratory diphtheria could be achieved in the European Region by 1990 by main-taining and strengthening immunization services [1]. However, a striking resurgence of epidemic diphtheria in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union has drawn attention to our lack of a full understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. The epidemic began in the Russian Federation {{at the end of the}} 1980 s and had affected all 15 NIS countries by the end of 1994 [2 ± 4]. Since 1992, some of the diphtheria cases reported from other parts of Europe have been linked to transmission from the NIS epidemic: in Belgium (3 / 3 cases), in England and Wales (1 / 19 cases), in Finland (10 / 10 cases), in Germany (8 / 23 cases), and in Greece (1 / 3 cases) [5].
