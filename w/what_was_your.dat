2500|$|Leykis denied {{allegations}} that the call {{was part of a}} hoax set up by the show, and producers turned over all information they had about the caller to police who began an investigation. Leykis discussed the confession on subsequent episodes of his show, urging listeners to phone a toll-free number if they had possibly relevant information, and offering a cash reward for information leading to conviction of the woman for murder. About a month later, former talk show host Geraldo Rivera asked Leykis about the incident on his Geraldo at Large syndicated television program. [...] Geraldo: [...] "So <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> first reaction when you got this call?" [...] Leykis: [...] "I was shocked.

2500|$|Movie Maker Magazine {{asked the}} producers, [...] "Voices of Iraq {{is truly a}} {{groundbreaking}} film—both {{in terms of its}} content and the process behind its production. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. [...] For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors. Second to that, the 35 mm blow-up." ...|$|E
