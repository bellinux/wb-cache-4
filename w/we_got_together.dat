And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
500|$|... "Causing a Commotion" [...] was {{recorded}} and mixed by Bray along with Shep Pettibone who also did additional production on the track. Junior Vasquez was the mixing engineer along with Steve Peck; the former also did the audio editing. Background vocals {{were provided by}} Donna De Lory and Niki Haris. [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] has a dancey, up-tempo groove in it. The musical arrangement consists {{of a number of}} hooks interpolating with each other. It begins with the chorus, where Madonna sings the line [...] "I've got the moves baby, You've got the motion, If <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> we be causing a commotion." [...] The verses are accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords.|$|E
500|$|The second track [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] has a danceable, up-tempo groove. The musical {{arrangement}} {{consists of}} a number of hooks interpolating with each other. It begins with the chorus, where Madonna sings the line [...] "I've got the moves baby, You've got the motions, If <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> we be causing a commotion." [...] The verses are accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords.

500|$|In February 2009, Pearl Jam {{went for}} a two-week session at Henson. It {{was the first time}} the band spent a {{considerable}} amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996's No Code. McCready said, [...] " [...] <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> with Ed and it really started getting more cohesive, we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan... It was a great idea to get us out of Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked about doing that for the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment." [...] In April 2009, the band {{went for a}} two-week session to finish the album with O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished, and O'Brien stated [...] "we had 90% of the record cut in the first nine days".|$|E

Earlier {{there had}} been speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} third album and the band's future, as some members worked on other musical projects. After the album was completed, the band said that these side projects [...] "saved the band" [...] and [...] "helped [...] break out of the box [...] were in". Coming back together and working out their differences hindered the writing process initially. During an interview in 2008, drummer Joey Jordison said [...] "we didn't talk to each other for three months, we just sat there wasting money in the fucking Houdini mansion." [...] Speaking retrospectively percussionist Shawn Crahan states; [...] "eventually we got sick of waiting for shit to happen. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>together,</b> had a few beers and wrote a really artsy, fucked up song called 'Happy Ending'." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
2500|$|The final was contested by England and Australia. Just before half time, England led 21–0 through tries from Andrew Harriman, Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber, all {{converted}} by Nick Beal. Michael Lynagh {{scored a}} try before haf time, {{but failed to}} convert his own try. In the second half Australia hit back strongly and first David Campese and then Semi Taupeaafe scored further tries, the latter also converted by Michael Lynagh. However, time ran out on the Australians and it was England captain [...] "Prince" [...] Andrew Harriman who was presented with the Melrose Cup by the Princess Royal. [...] Adedayo Adebayo, {{a member of that}} victorious side later recalled how surprising the victory had been to the players involved in it. He said [...] "We were basically a scratch side. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> {{for the first time as}} a team the week before, played one practice match and went on to win! But there were a lot of quality players in that side and looking back that's why we were able to wing it slightly – the talent came through. Looking back though we had no expectations of winning at the start. We didn't know how far we would go. It just happened." ...|$|E

Kat pawns her mother's ring to pay rent to Phil, but he refuses to let them back so she tells him she is trying to fix her marriage following her affair, so he changes his mind. Kat then receives an envelope with a key and a note. She returns to the flat and writes [...] "Kat loves Alfie" [...] on the mirror in lipstick. When Derek, Jack and Max notice that Kat has had to pawn her mother's engagement ring, one of them buys it back for £2500 as a gift for her. However, it seems the affair is over until Kat receives the gift of a watch, with a note saying [...] "Miss you. Time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>together</b> again x". Kat's lover tries to convince her to meet him at the bedsit, but when she arrives, she erases his message of love from the mirror, and bins the key. However, he then pays for Alfie to go on a trip to Germany to buy Christmas supplies, texting Kat that he now has her to himself. She then receives a candle from him, with a note saying to light it in an upstairs window so he knows when to visit. She throws it away, but Jean inadvertently lights another one. Kat extinguishes it, but it is too late as her lover arrives, he knocks on the celler door but kat doesn't open it.|$|E
