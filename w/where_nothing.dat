25|$|Creative midfielders are midfield {{players that}} {{are able to}} create goal scoring {{opportunities}} for the team often in situations <b>where</b> <b>nothing</b> seems likely. They usually have good ball control, passing ability and movement and will be blessed with vision and on-the-ball intelligence. They are usually attacking midfielders, though second strikers, wingers, and central midfielders can also be known as creative players.|$|E

25|$|The show {{is based}} on the theory that there is an {{alternate}} universe where every classic fairy tale character (new and old) exists—a world that has a loose connection to our world. On the night of her 28th birthday, bail bonds collector Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is reunited with Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore)—the son she gave up for adoption ten years previous—and takes him back to his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine—a place <b>where</b> <b>nothing</b> is what it seems.|$|E
25|$|Day 1 {{begins with}} the {{creation}} of light (and, by implication, time). God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them. In the ancient Near East the act of naming was bound up with the act of creating: thus in Egyptian literature the creator god pronounced the names of everything, and the Enûma Elish begins at the point <b>where</b> <b>nothing</b> has yet been named. God's creation by speech also suggests that he is being compared to a king, who has merely to speak for things to happen.|$|E

On the run up to the Turner Prize winner announcement, they also had a solo exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London (1999). Art works that were exhibited included Stasi City, Parliament (A Third House), and Gamma, a multiscreen video installation that was filmed at the former US military base at Greenham Common in Berkshire. This site was used to house nuclear cruise missiles during the Cold War and decommissioned in 1992. The Wilsons' video moves through the deserted institution, <b>where</b> <b>nothing</b> is now happening, evoking disturbing memories and possibilities. There {{is a sense of}} unease and threat, implied but never realised. They are the only characters in the film, appearing in military-style skirts and polished black shoes.|$|E

Milo is soon joining the inhabitants, the Lethargarians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted {{by the arrival of}} Tock, a talking oversize dog with an alarm clock on each side (a [...] "watchdog"), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and the watchdog joins him on his journey through Wisdom.|$|E

500|$|In her autobiography, she {{explained}} that all the people from her own town who {{had been to the}} big cities described them as [...] "marvelous places, <b>where</b> <b>nothing</b> was given but wealth". In 1934, at the age of 15, Eva escaped her poverty-stricken village when, according to popular myth, she ran off with a young musician to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires. The young couple's relationship would end almost as quickly as it began, but Eva remained in Buenos Aires. She began to pursue jobs on the stage and the radio, and eventually became a film actress. Eva had a series of relationships, and via some of these men she did acquire a number of her modeling appointments. She bleached her natural black hair to blond, a look she would maintain for the duration of her life.|$|E
