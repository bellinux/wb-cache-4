Hence, the secondary flow toward the center of a region of low pressure is also drawn upward by the significantly lower pressure at mid altitudes.

5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the period}} from April 10-20, 1920, a broad trough {{extended}} from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, producing inclement weather. At 7:00 a.m. EST (13:00 UTC) on April 20, observations from local stations indicated a low-pressure area of at most [...] over the Lower Mississippi River near Memphis, Tennessee. A counterclockwise circulation was evident on the daily weather maps, with a trailing cold front approaching Mississippi from the west. An influx of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico yielded surface temperatures of 70° F or greater as far north as Nashville, with mid to upper 70s over the southern halves of Mississippi and Alabama. Conditions were described as being [...] "cloudy and sultry," [...] even during the preceding night, with little fluctuation in relative humidity. Due to a steep temperature gradient and low-level moisture, atmospheric instability was conducive for convective growth, with a convergence zone providing sufficient wind shear for supercells. Relatively colder air above the surface also invaded the warm sector, further heightening parameters for severe thunderstorms. Despite <b>widespread</b> <b>cloud</b> cover, high temperatures in Alabama attained 85 °F or higher at several stations, illustrating the richness of the unstable air mass.|$|E

We find no statistically significant evidence to suggest that the DTR is connected to either long-term solar periodicities (11 or 1. 68 year) or short-term (daily-timescale) fluctuations in solar activity, and we attribute previous reports on the contrary to an incorrect estimation of the statistical significance of the data.

Cloud computing is all about services of various levels based upon Internet or Intranet including Software-as-a- Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).
