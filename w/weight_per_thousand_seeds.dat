The main {{objective of this}} study was to develop and evaluate an effective seed processing system for guayule. A combined threshing and grading system was developed following laboratory investigation of different approaches to seed threshing and separation. The seed processing system includes a rough surface belt type threshing mechanism, a cleaning unit consisting of a three layer reciprocating screen and an air assisted momentum discrimination chamber for grading and final separation. Harvested seed was processed using the machine at three belt clearances and speeds. The processed seed was analysed for <b>seed</b> purity, germination, <b>thousand</b> <b>seed</b> mass, clean seed recovery and processing efficiency. A threshing efficiency of up to 77 % was achieved at processing capacity of 300 g/h of clean seed. Belt clearance and speed both affected the quality of processed seed. The grading system resulted in separation of up to 63. 5 % of first grade seed with a purity of 98 % and germination of up to 76 %.

Traditional irrigation methods used in rice farming often result in great water loss. New water-saving methods are urgently needed to reduce water consumption. Three field and pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the furrow irrigation (FI) system to improve water use efficiency (WUE) and production of direct sowing rice in southern China. Compared to the conventional irrigation (CI) system (continuous flooding irrigation), for every square hectometer of rice field, the FI system reduced water use by 3130 [*]m 3, or 48. 1 %, and increased grain production by 13. 9 % for an early cultivar. For a late cultivar, the FI system reduced water use by 2655 [*]m 3, or 40. 6 %, and an increase of grain production by 12. 1 %. The improved WUE in the FI system is attributed to (1) a significant reduction of irrigation rate, seepage, evaporation, and evapotranspiration; (2) a significant reduction in the reduced materials, such as ferrous ion (Fe 2 +), and therefore an increase in the vitality of the root system, evident by the increases in the number of white roots by 32. 62 %, and decreases in the number of black roots by 20. 04 % and yellow roots by 12. 58 %; the use of the FI system may also reduce humidity of the rice field and enhance gas transport in the soil and light penetration, which led to reduced rice diseases and increased leaf vitality; and (3) increases in tiller and effective spikes by 11. 53 % and the <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> grains by 1. 0 [*]g.

This experiment was done in 2010 to evaluate the effects of nitrogen topdressing on source limitation, seed yield and yield components of different cultivars of maize. The experiment was conducted at the Research Farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch (Isfahan). It was a split plot arrangement based on a randomized complete block design with three replications. Four nitrogen topdressing levels (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N/ha) were tested in main plots and three cultivars (DC 370, MV 524 and SC 704) were tested in sub plots. Nitrogen topdressing was done when plants had 5 to 6 leaves. Nitrogen topdressing had significant influence on number of seeds per row, number of <b>seeds</b> <b>per</b> corn, <b>thousand</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weight,</b> seed yield, biological yield, harvest index and source limitation. Cultivar also had a significant influence on all characteristics evaluated in this experiment and number of rows per ear was also significantly affected by cultivar. Nitrogen reduced source limitation in all cultivars significantly. There was no significant influence of nitrogen and cultivar interaction on the characteristics evaluated in the experiment. The maximum for characteristics of; number of rows per corn, number of seeds per row, number of seeds per corn, seed yield, biological yield and harvest index was related to the application of 150 kg N/ha. Although the application of 150 kg N/ha had the highest <b>thousand</b> <b>seed</b> weight, there was no significant difference between this treatment and 50 kg N/ha.

Independente das épocas de semeadura os cultivares mais produtivos foram os híbridos Hélio 360 e Hélio 884 com média de 1. 709 e 1. 697 kg ha- 1 respectivamente. This {{study had}} as its objective, evaluating the agronomic performance of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) cultivars when sown at different times, under the environmental {{conditions in the}} south of the State of Tocantins. The experiment was carried out during the 2008 / 2009 agricultural year, in randomized blocks in a 4 x 5 factorial design (four sowing dates and five sunflower cultivars) with three replications. Each plot consisted of four rows 5. 0 m in length, spaced 0. 80 m apart with 0. 20 m between plants. For all sowing dates, the characteristics evaluated were: flowering, plant height, stem diameter, head diameter, normal achenes, grain <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> and grain yield. There was significant correlation of sowing dates with the evaluated cultivars for the traits of flowering, plant height and grain yield. In relation to periods of sowing, there was generally a negative influence on all evaluated traits for the later dates, due to an Indian summer causing moisture stress during the critical period of plant development and the occurrence of disease, especially alternaria leaf-spot. The first sowing period (November) showed higher productivity with an average of more than 3, 000 kg ha- 1. Irrespective of sowing dates, the more productive cultivars were the hybrids Helio 360 and Helio 884, with an average of 1, 709 and 1, 697 kg ha- 1 respectively...|$|R

Field studies were conducted to examine the effect of two strategies management systems: fertilizer treatment and intercropping soybean with corn on soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) population and soybean growth and yield parameters. The intercropping treatments were: soybean alone; 2 : 1 soybean/corn intercrop; and 3 : 1 soybean/corn intercrop. While the soil fertility treatments were the combination of NPK (urea 100 kg ha- 1 + SP- 36 200 kg ha- 1 + KCl 200 kg ha- 1) levels, dolomite (4 ton ha- 1), compost (10 ton ha- 1), and chicken manure (10 ton ha- 1). The results of the first study showed that the intercropping soybean with corn significantly reduced the population density of soybean aphids. However, there were no significant effects of intercropping systems on soybean growth (plant height) and yield (number <b>seed</b> <b>per</b> pod and <b>thousand</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weight)</b> performances except on the number of soybean pods per plant. Meanwhile, the result of the second study indicated that soil fertilizer treatments had a significant effect on the soybean plant characteristics: leaf numbers; pod numbers; and plant height. Combining intercropping methods and soil fertilizer management offer an opportunity to protect the soybean plants by natural and sustainable pest management...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of different nitrogen fertilizer levels and water stress during milky and dough stages on grain yield, yield components and water use efficiency of corn hybrid SC 704 (late maturing, non prolific and dent type), a field study was conducted. The factorial design of the study comprised of a randomized complete block with four replications. Four levels of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 92, 184 and 276 kg/ha nitrogen) along with three levels of irrigation (water stress imposed at milky stage, dough stage and a season-long optimum irrigation) were used as treatments. Results showed that water stress during milky and dough stages significantly decreased grain yield and thousand kernel weight. Also, effect of nitrogen fertilizer on grain yield, kernel number <b>per</b> ear, kernel <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> ear and <b>thousand</b> kernel weight was significant. Maximum grain yield was produced with 276 kg/ha nitrogen, although {{no significant differences were}} found among 92, 184 and 276 kg/ha nitrogen levels.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of various salinity levels on qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the natural community and, more particularly, ciliated protozoa, and compare this information with shrimp growth and survival. Tanks with 9 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> salinity were characterized by a higher pH, but also by a significantly higher concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) <b>per</b> <b>weight</b> of suspended matter (1. 93 +/- 0. 72 mug Chl a/mg TSS) than tanks with 18 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (1. 29 +/- 0. 68 mug Chl a/mg TSS) or 36 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> (1. 37 +/- 0. 61 mug Chl a/mg TSS) salinity. Concentrations of ciliates (max 6000 cells mL - 1) showed considerable fluctuations over the sampling period, reflecting the impact of water salinity, dynamic interactions between ciliates and their diverse roles within the shrimp production system. There was no significant difference between survival rates of shrimp reared at 9 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> 18 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> or 36 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand,</b> but decreasing salinity from 36 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> to 9 parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> led to a significant decrease in final shrimp body weight (from 13. 40 +/- 0. 26 g to 10. 23 +/- 2. 72 g).

40|$|The research, {{carried out}} over 2004 - 2007, {{investigated}} spring barley, Antek cultivar, grown in a strict fi eld experiment. The {{aim of the}} present research {{was to determine the}} effect of sulfur fertilization on the spring barley grain yield and the most essential yielding components. The fi rst experimental factor represented the sulfur application method (n= 2 : foliar and soil fertilization), while the second one – by the sulfur form (n= 2 : ionic and elementary), and the third one – sulfur dose (n= 4 : in kg S·ha- 1 : 0, 20, 40 (20 + 20), 60 (20 + 20 + 20)). As demonstrated by the present research, the weather pattern over the vegetation period showed a considerably greater effect on determining spring barley yielding components than the factors considered in the experiment. The differences between the mean values of the number of grains <b>per</b> spike, <b>thousand</b> <b>seed</b> grain and the number of spikes per 1 m 2 in extreme years were much greater than respective differences caused by the sulfur activity. The sulfur application method had a signifi cant effect on the number of grain <b>per</b> spike and <b>thousand</b> grain weight. It was shown that the soil application of sulfur generally enhances the values of those components more than the foliar application. The effect of the sulfur form used was signifi cant only in the case of thousand grain weight; its ionic form made it possible to reach higher values of that component than the elementary form. Of all the factors researched in the fi eld experiment, the spring barley grain yield structure components were most affected by the sulfur dose. The application of sulfur, in general, signifi cantly increased the values of the components researched. Based on the analysis of correlation there was noted the strongest relationship between the spring barley grain yield and the spike density. The second strongest effect on the grain yield was demonstrated by the number of grains per spike. Sulfur fertilization did not change clearly the relationship between the yield and its structure components...|$|R

Higher electrocatalytic activity of Pt(2 +) ions in CeO(2) and Ce(1 -aEuro parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> x) Ti (x) O(2) compared with the same amount of Pt(0) in Pt/C is attributed to Pt(2 +) ion interaction with CeO(2) and Ce(1 -aEuro parts <b>per</b> <b>thousand</b> x) Ti (x) O(2) to activate the lattice oxygen of the support oxide.
