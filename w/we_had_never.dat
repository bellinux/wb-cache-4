The episode's title is a reference to the Jewish mourning prayer service. Gordon was inspired to write the episode based on his heritage. He noted, [...] "I was always compelled by the Golem mythology. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> dealt with the horrors of antisemitism {{and the power of the}} word [...] And because I'm Jewish, it was something that was really compelling to me personally." [...] The idea to create a story centering on a Golem, however, had been proposed several times before by [...] "probably every Jewish writer who's passed through", according to Gordon.|$|E

500|$|James Madigan, {{the visual}} effects supervisor, {{approached}} the series as a feature film, observing that [...] "every {{aspect of the}} production took meticulous care with every detail, the costumes, the set dressing, the acting, and the attention to historical fact.

[...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI.

500|$|The final {{segment is}} based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] to exactly match its namesake because of a [...] "big legal issue", {{according}} to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that [...] "For years <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been able to parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, {{which is one of the}} all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so we got to clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it. I thought it was a really funny idea that instead of not ever seeing the Grand Pumpkin, it comes to life, and he's really horrified at the way humans cook pumpkins into pies, and eat pumpkin seeds, which are basically pumpkin fetuses...." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss. A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music. When Jean began his tenure as show runner, the only thing he thought to himself every day was [...] "Don't blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E

Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said [...] "one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough.

500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and I felt something grabbing my legs ... We took it {{out of the water and}} started throwing rocks and sticks at it. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen anything like that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms. Writers for WBALTV.com compared it to both a [...] "small, portly" [...] version of the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Lord of the Ringss Gollum's [...] "long-lost cousin".|$|E
500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E

500|$|It was {{intended}} that Yardley would appear lower {{down in the}} batting order, batting with a substantial total accumulated by the previous batsmen. However, the frailties of the England batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings. Bill Bowes, the Yorkshire and England bowler who covered the tour as a journalist, was impressed by Yardley's approach, noting {{that he did not}} back away from the fast bowlers, who frequently bowled bouncers at him: [...] "In fact, Yardley played cricket with a determination <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen in Yorkshire or in his days at the university." [...] He made the greatest impression as a bowler, surprising commentators with his effectiveness. He did not bowl in the first six matches, but in his first over of the tour dismissed Arthur Morris who had already scored a century. From that point, he was used effectively to break up partnerships. In the Tests, he removed Donald Bradman in three successive innings, while in the third Test, he took two wickets, including Bradman, in two deliveries. Bowes believed the natural length of Yardley's bowling was perfect for Australian pitches—he was not skilful enough to alter the length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective. The Australian reporter Clif Cary wrote [...] "It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time they seemed fairly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships, their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman's wicket for the third time, Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team-mate slapped him on the back and shouted [...] "Well, bowled, Spofforth".|$|E
