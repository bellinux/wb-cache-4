60|$|His attributes, though apart {{laid down}} in the word of God, that we, being weak, might the better {{conceive}} of his eternal power and godhead; yet <b>in</b> him they <b>are</b> without division; one glorious and eternal being. Again, though sometimes this, as of wisdom, or that, as of justice and mercy, <b>is</b> most manifest <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works and wonders before men; yet every such work is begun and completed by the joint concurrence of all his attributes. No act of justice is without his will, power, and wisdom; no act of mercy is against his justice, holiness and purity. Besides, no man must conceive of God, as if he consisted of these attributes, as our body doth of its members, one standing here, another there, for the completing personal subsistence. For though by the word we may distinguish, yet may we not divide them, or presume to appoint them their places in the Godhead. Wisdom <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> justice, holiness <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> power, justice <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mercy, holiness <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> love, power <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> goodness (1 John 1:9, Num 14:17,18).|$|R

5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E

5|$|After {{eight months}} {{extended}} leave in 1936, and a posting to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps, Wilton briefly returned to Australia to marry Helen Marshall on 9July 1938 at St. Andrew's Church in Summer Hill, New South Wales.

Promoted to captain in December 1938, Wilton saw out his British service with a coastal battery in Karachi, and was commissioned into the Royal Australian Artillery on 26May 1939.
