5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1948 season, on December 2, the Indians traded Groth to the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> {{along with}} Bob Kuzava for Frank Papish. After signing a {{contract}} with the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> Groth took part in spring, training alongside many other newcomers to the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> where his pitching performance earned him a place on the major league roster. He pitched in three games for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> losing one, and finished his tenure with the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> with a 5.40 ERA in five innings pitched. After his final game on May 4, the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> purchased Ed Klieman and sold Groth to the Kansas City Blues, a New York Yankees minor league team, ending his major league career.|$|E
5|$|Evers {{served as}} a coach for the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> in 1922 and 1923. He {{returned}} to second base in 1922, filling in for an injured Eddie Collins. Evers played in one game for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> as Collins recovered.|$|E
5|$|Evers {{was named}} the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> acting manager for the 1924 season, {{succeeding}} Chance, who was ordered home due to poor health. However, Evers suffered from appendicitis during the season, missing time during the year, and the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> opened up a managerial search when Chance died in September. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> replaced Evers with Collins after the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} {{professional}} season, Jackson {{signed as a}} non-roster invitee with the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> For the season, Jackson recorded an ERA of 5.01, allowing 31 runs over 46.2 innings pitched. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> released Jackson on September 2, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Latos {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} worth $3million with the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> prior to the 2016 season. Latos pitched to a 0.74 ERA in his first four starts for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> but then struggled, allowing 29 earned runs in his next 36 innings pitched (7.25 ERA) after April 30. After acquiring James Shields, the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> designated Latos for assignment on June 9.|$|E
5|$|Lemon was {{a manager}} with the Kansas City Royals, Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> and New York Yankees. He was named Manager of the Year with the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> and Yankees. In 1978, {{he was fired}} as manager of the <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> He was named Yankees manager one month later and he led the team to a 1978 World Series title. Lemon became the first AL manager to win a World Series after {{assuming}} the managerial role {{in the middle of}} a season.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 2015, Mayberry {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> On August 26, 2015, Mayberry was {{released}} by the <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b>|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 1927, the Senators traded Peckinpaugh to the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> for Leo Mangum and Sloppy Thurston. However, {{his playing}} {{time with the}} <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> was limited by a leg injury. He acted as an advisor to manager Ray Schalk. After one season with the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> Peckinpaugh retired as a player.|$|E
5|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> won {{the right}} to play at U.S. Cellular Field, their home field, {{as a result of a}} coin flip earlier in September. Fans were {{encouraged}} to wear all-black clothing to show support for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> The game was broadcast on TBS. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> used John Danks on three days rest as their starter, and the Twins started Nick Blackburn.|$|E
5|$|David Holmberg, {{class of}} 2009, is an American {{professional}} baseball pitcher for the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1946, former Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> {{teammate}} Ted Lyons was the {{new manager}} of the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> and offered Berg a coaching position. Berg declined. Boston Red Sox owner Thomas Yawkey, who was much closer to Berg when he played for the Red Sox, matched Lyons' offer, but Berg still turned them down. Berg did not apply for a teaching position, or join a law firm.|$|E
5|$|In Humber's 30th career {{start in}} MLB, he pitched the 21st perfect game in MLB history against the Seattle Mariners on April 21, 2012. It {{was the third}} perfect game in <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> history after those thrown by Charlie Robertson and Mark Buehrle, and the 18th no-hitter in <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> history. It was Humber's second start of the 2012 season and first career {{complete}} game.|$|E
5|$|In the 1948 season, the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> faced {{difficult}} decisions regarding their pitching staff and starting rotation. In {{the midst of}} Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence {{for most of the}} preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training. In his final exhibition matchup of the season against Johnny Schmitz, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> defeated the Chicago Cubs 1–0, making Grove the only <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason. By the end of May, Grove was the lone <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season. However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, {{and by the end of}} the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances.|$|E
5|$|Mark Buehrle {{holds the}} record for making the most Opening Day starts for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> with nine. Billy Pierce had seven Opening Day starts for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> Wilbur Wood had five, Tommy Thomas and Jack McDowell each had four, and Frank Smith, Jim Scott, Lefty Williams, Sad Sam Jones, Bill Dietrich, Gary Peters and Tommy John each had three. Several Baseball Hall of Famers have made Opening Day starts for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> {{including}} Ed Walsh, Red Faber, Ted Lyons, Early Wynn and Tom Seaver.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 2017, the Yankees traded Clippard, Blake Rutherford, Ian Clarkin, and Tito Polo to the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> for David Robertson, Todd Frazier, and Tommy Kahnle. Clippard made 11 {{appearances}} {{with the}} <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> earning two saves, and pitching to a 1.80 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Philip Humber of the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> {{pitched a}} perfect {{game against the}} Seattle Mariners by {{retiring}} all 27 batters he faced on April 21, 2012, as the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> defeated the Mariners 40. It was the 21st perfect game in Major League Baseball (MLB) history and the third {{by a member of}} the <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> It was Humber's first career complete game, although he had come close to achieving no-hitters on several occasions at several levels of organized baseball. The game was played in Seattle and broadcast regionally by Fox Sports in the two teams' metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> {{have made}} 16 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and 5 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> have failed to sign three of their first-round picks: Danny Goodwin (1971), Steve Buechele (1979), and Bobby Seay (1996). The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> did not receive any compensation for Goodwin or Buechele, but they did receive the 51st pick in 1997 for failing to sign Seay.|$|E
5|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> led {{for most}} of the season {{starting}} with a tie for first on May 17, held at least a share of the lead for 154 days, and never dropped more than a game behind the leader. The Twins spent much of the season in second place behind the <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> along with 54 days in the lead. Despite going 11–15 in September, the Twins took a half-game lead with an extra innings win over the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> on September 25 that capped a three-game sweep of Chicago. The Twins maintained that lead through their final game, forcing Chicago to play a make-up on September 29 against the Tigers which had been rained out earlier that month. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> won, 8–2, leaving the Sox and Twins tied atop the AL Central with 88–74 records, forcing a tie-breaker to decide the division. Tickets for the tie-breaker sold out within an hour {{of the end of the}} September 29 game.|$|E
5|$|Though it was {{reported}} that Scott would retire to manage his business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> signed Scott in February 1926. The Cincinnati Reds purchased Scott from the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> in July 1926. He played in four games for the Reds.|$|E
5|$|After {{he retired}} from pitching, Ruffing stayed with the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> {{organization}} to instruct their players. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> named Ruffing the manager of their Class A minor league affiliate, the Muskegon Clippers of the Central League, for the 1949 season. That season, the Clippers finished in fifth place out of six teams. In 1950, Ruffing managed the Daytona Beach Islanders of the Florida State League, a Cleveland Indians' affiliate.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} San Francisco Giants in 1962, Pierce played {{a pivotal role}} in helping them win the NL pennant, going 120 in home games and getting a three-hit shutout and a save in a three-game playoff against the Los Angeles Dodgers to clinch the title. His 1,999 career strikeouts were the fifth most by a {{left-hander}} when he retired, and his AL total of 1,842 ranked ninth in league history. He also ranked tenth among left-handers in career wins (211), sixth in games started (432) and games pitched (585), eighth in shutouts (38) and ninth in innings pitched (3,306⅔). He holds the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> franchise record for career strikeouts (1,796), and his club marks of 186 wins, 2,931 innings and 390 starts are team records for a left-hander. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> retired his number 19 in 1987, and unveiled a statue in his honor at U.S. Cellular Field in 2007; he was selected to the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> All-Century Team in 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> and the Detroit Tigers. Many of those in {{attendance}} had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{returned}} to Columbia {{after the season}} to continue working on his law degree. Despite <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> owner Charles Comiskey offering him more money to come to spring training, Berg declined, and informed the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> {{that he would be}} reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Born in Nacogdoches, Texas, Humber {{was raised}} in Carthage, Texas. Living in an area with an {{abundance}} of baseball fields, Humber grew up with a batting cage in his backyard. At the age of 11, Humber visited the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> during spring training in Florida as the guest of Robert Ellis, a family friend of the Humbers, who then was a minor league baseball pitcher for the <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b>|$|E
5|$|Houtteman {{remained}} a reliever during the 1956 Cleveland Indians season. He continued to get trade offers in 1956, though, as the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> {{were willing to}} trade outfielder Jim Rivera for him. A three-team, nine-player deal involving Houtteman again {{becoming part of the}} <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> along with George Strickland was also scrapped at the last second. Houtteman finished the 1956 season having only made 22 appearances on the mound, earning a 2–2 record. However, he had a high ERA of 6.56, his highest since 1946, when he made one appearance.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, South Bend {{community}} leaders began seeking a minor-league baseball {{team for the}} city. A stadium was constructed in 1986 and a 10-year player-development contract was signed with the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> The team would {{be known as the}} South Bend <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> In 1994, the team's name was changed to the South Bend Silver Hawks. The Silver Hawks changed their name to The South Bend Cubs in 2015. They are a Class A minor league affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in the Midwest League.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, Greer hosted eight {{major league}} teams {{competing}} {{in five games}} in what was billed as the Nashville Baseball Classic. On March 28, the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> defeated the Texas Rangers by a score of 4–3. The Cleveland Indians won over the St. Louis Cardinals, 9-3, in a second game played the same day. March 29's doubleheader saw the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> defeat the Montreal Expos, 9–5, and the Detroit Tigers beat the Cincinnati Reds, 7–4. On March 31, the Expos won over the Kansas City Royals, 3–1.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} two seasons with Chicago, Pierce posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen contributed to his {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in the sixth inning or later 15 times in those seasons, <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce was seen to be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh's <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|Of the 65 players picked in {{the first}} round by the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox,</b> 31 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 20 of them were right-handed, while 11 were left-handed. Twelve outfielders, eight catchers, five shortstops, five third basemen, and four first basemen were also taken. The team has never drafted a player at second base. Fourteen of the players came from high schools or {{universities}} in the state of California, and Florida follows with eight players. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> have also drafted six players from their home state of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2017, Asche {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox.</b> He was outrighted to AAA on May 16, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Suffering from {{recurrent}} knee injuries, the Yankees released Ruffing {{after the}} 1946 season. He {{signed with the}} Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> for the 1947season, but continued to be limited by his knee. In May, the <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> removed Ruffing from their active roster after he was hit in his bad knee with another line drive. He rejoined the White Sox' active roster in July. He pitched to a 3–5 win–loss record and a 6.11 ERA in nine games pitched on the season. Ruffing retired after the 1947 season.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> are a Major League Baseball {{franchise}} {{based in}} Chicago. They {{play in the}} American League Central division. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> have used 62 Opening Day starting pitchers since they were established as a Major League team in 1901. The {{first game of the}} new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> have a record of 60 wins and 53 losses in their Opening Day games, through the 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|The Marlins {{lost their}} first-round pick in 2001 to the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> as {{compensation}} for signing free agent Charles Johnson.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{lost their}} first round {{pick in the}} 1983 draft to the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> as {{compensation}} for signing free agent Steve Kemp.|$|E
5|$|After the 2012 season, Kevin Youkilis, who the Red Sox {{traded to}} the Chicago <b>White</b> <b>Sox</b> earlier in the season, signed with the Yankees as a free agent. He had {{previously}} clashed with Joba Chamberlain {{when he was with}} Boston.|$|E
