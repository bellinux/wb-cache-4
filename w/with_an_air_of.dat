5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|E

He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature {{had given him a}} sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E
25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{is often}} {{mentioned}} to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This {{serves as a}} stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance. The Piraeus Athena, here is in contrapposto stance, meaning that her left leg is more relaxed, while she is putting her weight on the right leg. This position portrays {{the idea that she}} is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer.

[...] Todd's [...] "overhanging brow" [...] seemed threatening, but instead concealed the [...] "intense, vulnerable eyes underneath", features that contrasted well with the character's [...] "pouty, sensual mouth". The features, which conferred [...] "a charming, boyish quality", could sometimes convey that Todd was less dangerous than he actually was. Photographer Robert Milazzo believed Howarth's hair softened Todd's character. [...] "You don't expect that intensity because of it," [...] he said, and felt that it made Todd more intriguing. Milazzo also stated {{that the combination of}} Todd's soft hair and intensity made Todd [...] "a very complex character to look at".|$|E

Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as Charles Young, Paul Laurence Dunbar, John Hope and Mary White Ovington.

500|$|In December 2009, Beyoncé {{announced}} that she would release her first fragrance, titled Heat, the following year. Prior to releasing the fragrance, she had collaborated with Tommy Hilfiger on his perfume True Star in 2004 and Giorgio Armani's Diamonds for which she also appeared in several promotional campaigns. Beyoncé created the fragrance in 2009 with the testing of its smell done by Coty, Inc.. Beyoncé presented Heat to her fans during backstage meetings on her I Am... World Tour (2009–10). It was released in the United States on February 3, 2010. According to Beyoncé's official parfum website, Heat is a [...] "captivating fragrance that unleashes a spirited fire within."

Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a very good job of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E

500|$|Let the Right One In was an {{international}} success. Critics lauded {{the performances of}} the young leads, often highlighting Leandersson for particular acclaim. According to Karen Durbin of Elle, she [...] "evokes Eli's radical apartness <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> watchful caution and a contained stillness of body that not only belies her childish appearance (...)", and [...] "In a performance devoid of sentimentality she perfectly captures the awful solitude of a creature who exists outside time". James Berardinelli also praised Leandersson for [...] "crafting an individual who is both mysterious and compelling", while Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "The youthful actors imbue even the most emotional and disturbing scenes with remarkable complexity. Leandersson is particularly impressive as the conflicted young vampire who wants {{nothing more than to}} be an ordinary girl again". Luke Y. Thompson of LA Weekly compared her performance favorably to that of Kirsten Dunst as the child vampire Claudia in Interview with the Vampire. He concluded that, while Dunst [...] "used to be the gold standard; in Leandersson, I think we have a new champion." [...] The Oregonian called Leandersson's performance [...] "incredible", and expressed doubt that any actress in the American remake could top it. While Swedish reviewers generally made positive comments about the two leads, Emma Engström of Göteborgs-Posten felt that Leandersson's character was lacking in depth.|$|E
500|$|Borscht's westward {{expansion}} {{was less}} successful; Germans used to scoff at the soup {{along with other}} East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819.

In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with herrings, sturgeon, coulibiac, Pozharsky cutlets and vinaigrette salad, at a Russian-themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.|$|E
