25|$|Indians {{arrived in}} Trinidad and Tobago on May 30, 1845 as indentured laborers on the sugarcane, cocoa, and rice plantations, {{to fill the}} labor void left by the {{abolition}} of slavery. The island's growing Indian population developed the musical style of chutney. This musical form based on Indian rhythms was named chutney because it is hot music, its use of double entendres and fast and repetitive rhythms make its listeners <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance.</b> Chutney uses a mixture of East Indian classical music, East Indian folk music, bhajans and ghazals (bhajans and ghazals are religious songs), Western and African instruments, and usually the Indian musical instruments: harmonium, dholak, tabla, dhantal, manjira, tassa, and sometimes the bulbul tarang to accompany its fast-paced soca or calypso beats. Sundar Popo {{was one of the}} first who pioneered in this music. Chutney music is a mixture of Indian tunes influenced by calypso and soca rhythms, and it has been blended with many of the other varieties of music on the island. Artists like Apache Waria and Terry Gajraj pioneered ragga chutney. Chutney has also developed into chutney-bhangra, chutney-hip-hop, soca-bhangra and bhangra-wine.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} critical acclaim from music critics, with many citing it as {{a highlight of}} the album. Paul Lester from BBC felt that the song was [...] "generic machine RnB". Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented that [...] "Dance in the Dark", along with [...] "Monster" [...] are a [...] "delightfully dirty retro workout ..... to make for one surprisingly effective pop cocktail." [...] Scott Plagenhoef from Pitchfork Media felt that Gaga had morphed into Madonna on the song. Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented that [...] "'Dance in the Dark' {{is the sort of}} song that, well, makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> with your top off in a grotty German bondage basement." [...] Edna Gunderson from USA Today called the song [...] "campy".|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{vacation}} season, the Phanceys entrust Viv with looking after the motel for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, [...] "Sluggsy" [...] Morant and Sol [...] "Horror" [...] Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there to look over the motel for insurance purposes. The two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that Sanguinetti can make a profit on the insurance. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The mobsters are cruel to Viv and, when she says she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top. They are about to continue the attack with her rape when the door buzzer interrupts them.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{inspired}} to create an album where [...] "every song was a killer" [...] and developed Thriller with that in mind. Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album. Jones discussed [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and {{why it was so}} personal to Jackson, who struggled to deal with a number of obsessed fans. Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened; however, Jackson insisted that it remain because it made him <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance.</b> The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall. Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song [...] "Beat It". Eventually, they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm-guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo.|$|E

The mid-tempo, [...] "bubble-gum pop" [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] (Daddy I Love You), {{named one of the}} album's biggest hits, [...] "pairs a straightforward love song with the well known reggae riddim Buyout." [...] Ramiro Burr of Billboard stated [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] showcases how [...] "effortlessly and quickly she alternately sings and raps, claiming that she has a distinct vocal style that evokes Gwen Stefani". Although, the literal translation of [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] is [...] "Daddy I Love You", it is not directed towards Queen's father but to her love interest; [...] "Papi" [...] can be translated to [...] "baby". [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] (I <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Dance)</b> incorporates the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim produced by the [...] "Jamaican cross-over guru" [...] Jeremy Harding. The song's lyrics [...] "warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves." [...] She degrades her partner who thinks that just because she dances with him that she is automatically going to have sexual relations with him.|$|E

500|$|Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine {{said the}} track [...] "shows Janet the 4/4 we assumed she lost, though the beat whomps so relentlessly here it's {{hard to know}} how she could've ever {{misplaced}} it." [...] The song's [...] "octane," [...] composition, and bridge were also praised, with Henderson adding she's [...] "accidentally discovered the essence of hip-hop for good measure." [...] Slant Magazine ranked it the eighth best single of 2008 and fifty-ninth best song of the decade, declaring it [...] "infectiously bizarre" [...] and commending its advanced production and lyrical content. NRJ France commended its [...] "sexy chorus" [...] and [...] "fat electro bass", saying it [...] "remains easily in your head." [...] The Los Angeles Times noted its [...] "top-notch" [...] and [...] "glossed-over" [...] production, praising the [...] "tech-savvy groove" [...] while adding [...] "It'll sound great in a club." [...] The Daily Star heralded the [...] "buzzy hook fest" [...] as Jackson's [...] "best single in a decade," [...] while Australia's Daily Telegraph called it a [...] "cracking pop track." [...] Elsewhere, it was called [...] "crisp", [...] "danceable", and [...] "ridiculously good", also [...] "lavished with Janet's trademark velvet harmonies." [...] MuuMuse ranked it the nineteenth best single of the year, while MuchMusic praised the single as a return to form, saying [...] "People <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance.</b> You like to dance. Together, the world can dance once again." [...] Bob Burke of FMQB described the song as [...] "a whole new groove for Jackson" [...] that [...] "fits like a glove," [...] adding [...] "the early 'feedback' indicates another multi-format hit in the making." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Harlem, Sims began performing {{on the street}} {{as he had done}} in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: [...] "I knew people who danced on dinner plates... There was a man who could dance on newspapers without tearing them. And another who constructed a gigantic xylophone to tap on." [...] He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the [...] "Amateur Night" [...] stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.When big name dancers played The Apollo, {{there was nothing in the}} audience but dancers with their shoes," [...] said Sandman Sims. [...] "Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers. That's the reason a guy would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> at The Apollo.By the mid-1950s, he had been hired as the Apollo's stage manager, and soon began his role as the Apollo's famed [...] "executioner", chasing Amateur Night contestants the crowd disapproved of off the stage with a shepherd's crook (known since vaudeville times as [...] "the hook") a broom, or other props, while dressed in a variety of wacky costumes, whether long underwear, a clown suit, or even a diaper. Backstage, however, he would console defeated contestants with the story of his having been booed off ten times before he finally got to finish his own act. Sims would play [...] "executioner" [...] until shortly after Time Warner took over the Apollo in 1999.|$|E
500|$|Laura Fissinger from South Florida Sun-Sentinel {{felt that}} [...] "'Virgin Tour' {{establishes}} Madonna {{more as a}} bimbo, rather than the strong, independent woman people think her to be." [...] David O'Reilly from Philadelphia Daily News said that with the concert [...] "Madonna proved once more why she was called a 'talentless bimbo'; it was utter trash." [...] Richard Defendorf of Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review, saying [...] "Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' was very enjoyable and she put her music video charms in her live performances." [...] Maya Hathoray from The Miami Herald said that [...] "We know [...] sexy, exotically beautiful and her funk/pop songs make us <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance,</b> but on stage, she is extremely tame compared to her raw persona in her music videos. She is like daddy's little girl." [...] Mary Edgar Smith from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution observed that [...] "It was obvious from the apparel of the young girls at last week's Virgin Tour concerts in Tampa and Orlando, Fla., that the 26-year-old singer [...] had more {{to give to the}} music world than what others suggest. She will be {{a force to be reckoned}} with." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented, [...] "While her pubescent lookalike fans cheer approvingly, the star's manipulation of such symbols as a wedding gown, a cross, furs and jewels becomes a lighthearted communal psychodrama. Madonna has brought traditional little girl's games of dress-up and playing with dolls (using oneself as model) into the television age by turning them into a public spectacle." [...] A review in Variety by John Gleeson said that [...] "Madonna's singing was like a soundtrack to a more visceral display of herself, her persona, her nonstop dancing and her surprisingly explicit sexual dare, which included a visual climax—so to speak—to every other song." [...] Paul Grein from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's show was stylish, well-paced and consistently entertaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Copsey for Digital Spy {{shared the}} same opinion as Graham, writing [...] "We {{labelled}} 'Where Have You Been' the record's 'Don't Stop The Music'." [...] He continued to give an explanation {{as to why the}} songs are similar writing [...] "On the surface, similarities between the two are almost non-existent, but on closer inspection, not only are they the danciest cuts on their respective LPs, they're both favourites that fans have been eager to see get an official release." [...] Copsey concluded his review praising the song and Rihanna, writing [...] "Like Rihanna herself, it's hectic, confident and unashamedly sexual." [...] Meghan Brownfield for the Columbia Missourian praised the song as a track which people will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> to as well as writing that the lyrics ensure that the listener pays attention to the lyrics, saying [...] "It is a song you would hear in a club that everyone would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> to. This song makes you want to move, and it also has some strong lyrics that make you focus on what she is saying." [...] Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine, however, was critical of the song, writing that the song is a [...] "boring dubstep-normalizing dance number reminiscent of LMFAO," [...] as well as Rihanna's own [...] "We Found Love".|$|E

(Duet: [...] – [...] "Five, ten, twenty"). Figaro is quite pleased with their new room; Susanna far less so (Duettino: [...] – [...] "If the Countess should call you during the night"). She is bothered by its proximity to the Count's chambers: it seems he has been making advances toward her and plans on exercising his droit du seigneur, the purported feudal right of a lord to bed a servant girl on her wedding night before her husband can sleep with her. The Count had the right abolished when he married Rosina, but he now wants to reinstate it. Figaro is livid and plans to outwit the Count (Cavatina: Se vuol ballare signor contino – [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>dance,</b> sir count").|$|E
