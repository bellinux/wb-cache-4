5|$|Scott {{focused on}} the {{development}} of his homestead as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> grief of losing his son. The settlement became known as Scott's Landing, and Scott briefly served as a tobacco inspector for the area. Determined to make Scott's Landing the centerpiece of a larger settlement called Petersburg, he began selling lots near the settlement in November 1788. Among those who purchased lots were James Wilkinson, Abraham Buford, Judge George Muter, and future Congressman and Kentucky Governor Christopher Greenup.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and that the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

25|$|One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> foreign {{exchange}} risk is {{to engage in a}} forward transaction. In this transaction, money does not actually change hands until some agreed upon future date. A buyer and seller agree on an exchange rate for any date in the future, and the transaction occurs on that date, regardless of what the market rates are then. The duration of the trade can be one day, a few days, months or years. Usually the date is decided by both parties. Then the forward contract is negotiated and agreed upon by both parties.|$|E

One minor setback came when Penguin and their lawyers Davenport Lyons were keen that the information provided by the experts they had instructed be incorporated in an amended defence (which Heather Rogers drafted). Initially Mishcon were unpersuaded but Davenport Lyons were insistent, feeling that the amended document provided a clear statement of the strong evidence against Irving. The decision was eventually left to Richard Rampton and Heather Rogers as they would be presenting the case and both were in favour of amending. Mishcon relented.|$|E

Craig brought the national party's problem to the state. Jenner and the party leadership supported faction of the party was virulently anti-communist, but Craig openly sided with Eisenhower and the wing of the party advocating a more measured response to the problem. Jenner was incensed not only by Craig's position on communism, but also on his campaign platform that advocated significant increased state spending and the start of a number of new programs. The difference between Craig and the party continued throughout his time in office. Craig's Democratic opponent was incumbent lieutenant governor John Watkins. Thanks in large part to Eisenhower's popularity, Craig won a landslide victory in the election.|$|E

25|$|The Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) was {{established}} {{by the government in}} 2001. Initially designed to last two years, it has been subsequently extended {{in the absence of an}} alternative <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> issues it addresses. This program has the objective of targeting subsidies to the poor on a geographical basis and implementing rolling blackouts in a more organized fashion. The poorest neighborhoods in the cities were to have a provision of about 20 hours of electricity per day at a price highly subsidized by the government and the utility. The PRA was initially considered a success. However, the country's macroeconomic crisis, the perverse incentives built into the PRA, and the deficiently targeted subsidy scheme have jeopardized the medium-term sustainability of the program. The absence of demand management, the lack of metering systems, sustained losses, a culture of non-payment and the absence of incentives for the distribution companies to fix the technical problems make it urgent to design a new subsidy and rationing system that is part of a more comprehensive approach to solve the problems of the power sector.|$|E
25|$|For those {{grounded}} in the RPG tradition, the very first release of Call of Cthulhu created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by Dungeons & Dragons, which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced {{the concept of the}} Onion Skin: Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the Player Characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, CoC assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run CoC campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.|$|E
25|$|One thing more: at {{the close}} of the Civil War, when the problem of the emancipated slaves was before the nation, it might have left them in a {{condition}} of alienage, or established them as wards of the government, like the Indian tribes, and thus retained for the nation jurisdiction over them, or it might, as it did, give them citizenship. It chose the latter. By the Fourteenth Amendment, it made citizens of all born within the limits of the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. By the Fifteenth, it prohibited any state from denying the right of suffrage on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and by the Thirteenth, it forbade slavery or involuntary servitude anywhere within the limits of the land. Whether this was or was not the wiser <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> great problem is not a matter for the courts to consider. It is for us to accept the decision, which declined to constitute them wards of the nation or leave them in a condition of alienage where they would be subject to the jurisdiction of Congress, but gave them citizenship, doubtless believing that thereby, in the long run, their best interests would be subserved, they taking their chances with other citizens in the states where they should make their homes.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} filming, Eastwood {{had finally}} had enough of Leone's perfectionist directorial traits. Leone, often forcefully, insisted on {{shooting}} scenes from many different angles, {{paying attention to the}} most minute of details, which would often exhaust the actors. Leone, an obese glutton, was also a source of amusement for his excesses, and Eastwood found a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him [...] "Yosemite Sam" [...] for his bad temperament. After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role as Harmonica in Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to Charles Bronson. Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of Once Upon a Time in America (1984) when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of Robert De Niro, saying, [...] "Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same—a block of marble. Bobby first of all is an actor, Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers, Clint yawns."
