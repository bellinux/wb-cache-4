5|$|Following the 1973 oil crisis, the {{oil shale}} {{industry}} was restarted in several countries, {{but in the}} 1980s, <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> prices fell, many industries faced closure. The global oil shale industry has grown again from the mid-1990s. In 2003, the oil shale development program was initiated in the United States, and in 2005, the commercial leasing program for oil shale and tar sands was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|The IIF {{was able}} to invest in {{development}} projects due to Disston's purchase, {{and an opportunity to}} improve transportation arose <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> tycoon Henry Flagler began purchasing land and building rail lines along the east coast of Florida, as far south as Palm Beach in 1893. Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations. The land bordering the rail lines was developed as citrus farms. By 1896 the rail line had been extended to Biscayne Bay. Three months after the first train had arrived, the residents of Miami voted to incorporate the town. Miami became a prime destination for extremely wealthy people after the Royal Palm Hotel was opened.|$|E
50|$|Tertiary {{recovery}} begins <b>when</b> secondary <b>oil</b> {{recovery is}} not enough to continue adequate extraction, but only <b>when</b> the <b>oil</b> can still be extracted profitably. This depends on the cost of the extraction method and the current price of crude <b>oil.</b> <b>When</b> prices are high, previously unprofitable wells are brought back into use, and when they are low, extraction is curtailed.|$|R
50|$|Senegalia mellifera is {{a common}} thorn tree in Africa. The name mellifera refers to its sweet-smelling {{blossoms}} and honey.

5|$|The {{population}}s of many small Texas towns had even greater population increases <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> discoveries brought prospectors, investors, field laborers, and businessmen. Between 1920 and 1922, {{the town of}} Breckenridge in rural North Texas grew from about 1,500 people to nearly 30,000. Between 1925 and 1929, the town of Odessa in the Permian Basin grew from 750 to 5,000. Between 1924 and 1925, the town of Wortham in northern Texas grew from 1,000 to about 30,000. The town of Kilgore in eastern Texas grew from about 500 to 12,000 between 1930 and 1936 following {{the discovery of the}} East Texas field.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} and most undeveloped {{countries}} in the world <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> was discovered in the late 1930s. The country therefore needed foreign expertise and labour to exploit its vast oil reserves. As a result, in the years after World War II there was a growth in the numbers of foreign technical, professional and administrative personnel, mainly from other Middle Eastern countries but also supplied by Western oil companies, many of whom worked for ARAMCO (Arabian-American Oil Company). A much greater increase in the numbers of foreign workers came with the oil-price boom following the 1973 oil crisis. Infrastructure and development plans led to an influx of skilled and unskilled workers, principally Palestinians, Egyptians, Yemenis and others from Arab countries, but also Indians and Pakistanis, leading to a doubling of the Saudi population by 1985. Beginning in the early 1980s, South and East Asian countries, such as Thailand, Philippines and South Korea, increasingly provided migrant workers.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>oil</b> prices {{increased}} from 2002 onwards, the regulator failed to approve electricity tariff increases, {{because they were}} expected to have been very unpopular. The financial burden of the higher generation costs was thus passed on to the privatized distribution company, which has, partly as a result, been suffering severe losses.|$|E
25|$|Lester Brown {{believes}} this problem might {{be solved by}} the government establishing a price floor for oil. A tax shift raising gas taxes is the same idea.

25|$|Historical {{investment}} levels There are no {{recent data}} {{on the level of}} investments in the sector. In the five years between 1997 and 2001 Venezuela invested US$ 637million in water and sanitation, or about US$ 127million annually on average. Investment in the sector has historically been volatile. For example, annual investments fluctuated in the 1986-1998 period between less than US$100million (in 1989) and US$400million (in 1992). To a large extent investment levels mirror fluctuation in oil prices. Investment levels declined from 1986-1989 <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> prices were very low. Investments skyrocketed in 1992 after oil prices had increased. Then they plummeted again <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> prices decreased during the remainder of the 1990s. The volatility in sector financing has made it difficult to initiate a sustainable medium-term investment program needed to rehabilitate infrastructure and extend access to services.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>oil</b> fields become depleted, the {{operator}} injects water to keep pressure high for further extraction. This requires power, but installing gas turbines means {{shutting down the}} extraction process, losing valuable income.

25|$|Huntington Beach sits above a large natural fault {{structure}} containing oil. Although the oil {{is mostly}} depleted, extraction continues at a slow rate, and still provides significant local income. There are only two off-shore extraction facilities left, however, and the day is not far off <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> production in the city will cease and tourism will replace it as the primary revenue source for resident industry.|$|E
25|$|Venezuela {{had enjoyed}} {{democratic}} stability since 1958, {{and also a}} degree of prosperity. This prosperity was greatly enhanced in the 1970s, <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> prices increased substantially, and Venezuela, a large petroleum exporter, received large revenues, which increased per capita income by about 40%. Venezuela experienced modernization and {{had one of the}} highest GDP per capita in its history, while also having an exchange rate of 4 bolivares per 1 US dollar.|$|E

25|$|At one time, an {{encyclopedia}} company gave away free parcels of land (with {{the purchase of}} a whole set for $126) in the Huntington Beach area. The lucky buyers got more than they had bargained for <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> was discovered in the area, and enormous development of the oil reserves followed. Though many of the old reserves are depleted, and the price of land for housing has pushed many of the rigs off the landscape, oil pumps can still be found to dot the city.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in January 1937, the Ohio River was {{in various}} flood stages for three months. The flood led to river fires <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> tanks in Cincinnati, Ohio were {{destroyed}} in the flood. In Kentucky, one-third of Kenton and Campbell counties were submerged, and 70% of Louisville was under water for over a week. Paducah, Owensboro, and other Purchase area cities were devastated. Damages from the flood (nationwide) totaled twenty million dollars without adjusting for inflation. It led to extensive flood prevention efforts in the Purchase area, including the distinctive flood wall at Paducah.|$|E

I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Alberta in 1902, {{but it did}} not become a significant industry in the province until 1947 when reserves of it were discovered near Leduc. Calgary quickly found itself at the centre of the ensuing oil boom. The city's economy grew <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> prices increased with the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973. The population increased by 272,000 in the eighteen years between 1971 (403,000) and 1989 (675,000) and another 345,000 in the next eighteen years (to 1,020,000 in 2007). During these boom years, skyscrapers were constructed and the relatively low-rise downtown quickly became dense with tall buildings.|$|E

Although Lloyd George and others have suggested that nothing was given in return, according to Rutledge and others, Lloyd George promised at least one or even all of, support for French claims on the Ruhr, that <b>when</b> <b>oil</b> production in Mosul began, France would receive a share and that Sykes–Picot obligation would be maintained as regards Syria.|$|E
