5|$|Although the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian {{tradition}} {{historically has}} attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in its current form was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E
5|$|Fleming was {{not happy}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> owing to the {{reactions}} by critics and fans, and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, rather than any aspects of the plots. However, a British paperback edition was published after his death, and the Bond film character of Jaws is loosely based {{on one of the}} characters in the book.|$|E

5|$|In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye {{for what}} {{proved to be}} his last holiday and wrote {{the first draft of}} The Man with the Golden Gun. He was {{dissatisfied}} with it and wrote to William Plomer, the copy editor of his novels, asking for it to be rewritten. Fleming became increasingly unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and considered rewriting it, but was dissuaded by Plomer, who considered it viable for publication.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers {{killed in the}} line of duty, regarding the high cost, and that the roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or as a result of criminal acts, rather than all officers killed {{in the line of}} duty; also that, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E
5|$|The huge, neon-lit KONA LANES BOWL {{sign was}} {{featured}} in publications by the Costa Mesa Historical Society, along <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Tiki and Tiki Road Trip; it also inspired professional paintings, {{and was one of}} several Costa Mesa landmarks memorialized in a mural painted on the local Floyd's 99 Barbershop. In 2003, Costa Mesa Planning Commissioner Katrina Foley led an effort to save the sign from the scrap heap.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the royal tombs were decorated with religious texts and images. The early tombs were decorated with scenes from Amduat ('That Which is in the Underworld'), which describes the journey of the sun god through the twelve hours of the night. From the time of Horemheb, tombs were decorated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of Gates, which shows the sun god passing through the twelve gates that divide the nighttime and ensures the tomb owner's own safe passage through the night. These earliest tombs were generally sparsely decorated, and those of a non-royal nature were totally undecorated.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien devised several {{themes that}} were reused in {{successive}} drafts of his legendarium, beginning <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Lost Tales, written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during The Battle of the Somme. The two most prominent stories, {{the tale of}} Beren and Lúthien and that of Túrin, were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in The Lays of Beleriand).|$|E
5|$|Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{mentioned}} above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, {{which said}} that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples {{in the philosophy of}} nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw nothing wrong <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1549, {{a series}} of uprisings known as the Prayer Book Rebellion forced Vermigli to leave Oxford and take up {{residence}} at Lambeth Palace with Cranmer. The rebellion involved conservative opposition to a vernacular liturgy, which was imposed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of Common Prayer at Pentecost in 1549. Rioters {{in the streets of}} Oxford threatened Vermigli with death. At Lambeth, Vermigli assisted Cranmer by helping write sermons against the rebellion. After some time he returned to Oxford, where he was made first canon of Christ Church in January 1551. Vermigli, the first married priest at Oxford, caused controversy by bringing his wife into his rooms overlooking Fish Street at the Great Quadrangle. His windows were smashed several times until he moved to a location in the cloisters, where he built a fortified stone study.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho {{monogram}} {{has grown}} to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across {{the majority of the}} page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of Durrow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E

5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{discussion}} of tulip mania began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay; he proposed that {{crowds of people}} often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins. In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.|$|E
5|$|When the Munich town {{administration}} {{developed a}} constitution of its council, a seal {{was necessary for}} the purposes of asserting the authenticity of town-council documents. Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. The monk as a sole heraldic figure can be found on a seal dating from the year 1304, and on flags of the city since the middle of the 14th century.
