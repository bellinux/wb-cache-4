25|$|The {{environment}} in Genie's new placement was extremely rigid {{and gave her}} far less access to her favorite objects and activities, and her caretakers rarely allowed her mother to visit. Soon after she moved in they began to subject her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, resulting in both incontinence and constipation resurfacing and causing her to revert to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the strongest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>let</b> her see her mother, making her terrified of opening her mouth for fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As a result, she was extremely frightened of eating or speaking, and she became extremely withdrawn and almost exclusively relied on sign language for communication. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have regular contact with her, continuing to conduct weekly meetings to continue her testing, and she noted the extreme deterioration in Genie's condition. She quickly started petitioning to have Genie taken out of the home, but Curtiss said that both she and social services had a difficult time contacting John Miner, only succeeding after several months. In late April 1977, with assistance from David Rigler, Miner removed her from this location.|$|E

Lilitu (or the Lilitu spirits) was considered to be an anthropomorphic bird-footed, wind or night demon and was often described as a sexual predator who subsisted on the blood of babies and their mothers.

Jessica Sager of Pop Crush noted that Bieber sports a mature look on both covers, using Elvis Presley's hair style and wearing a white t-shirt underneath a short sleeved, navy and white plaid button down with a thin chain necklace. The winning artwork was revealed on March 19, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Skinner and Tyrawley {{agreed that}} the most {{pressing}} threat {{was that of a}} combined land and sea assault focusing on the weakest part of the defences, the open ground between the South Front of the town and Europa Point {{at the end of the}} peninsula. However, they disagreed vehemently over where and how to construct the defences. Tyrawley put a great deal of energy into constructing new earthworks, batteries and a series of retrenched lines between the South Bastion and the New Mole, called the Prince of Wales Lines. It was said of him that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>let</b> a day pass [...] "without visiting the works once or twice during his stay where there was a possibility of going out." [...] Skinner disagreed with the placement of the new fortifications and criticised the use of compacted earth and sun-baked bricks, which had enabled them to be built at great speed and minimum cost, rather than stone. Skinner perhaps had a point, as most of Tyrawley's works were washed away by rain within only a few years.|$|E

The question the writers wanted to answer was, despite being made from the same [...] "raw materials," [...] how would upbringing and environment affect the type of people they would become later in life? Joss Whedon describes her as everything Buffy <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>let</b> herself become; although Buffy is tempted by Faith's approach to slaying, she ultimately decides not to make the same choices herself. Some fans argued that the show developed a lesbian subtext between Faith and Buffy; Jane Espenson states that Whedon says he didn't intend this, but admitted it was there after he had it pointed out to him, jokingly attributing this to his subconscious.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1989, {{after her}} Sizzling Spectacular concert in Nevada, Gordon {{forcibly}} married Jackson, claiming {{it was for}} her own protection against kidnapping by her family.

[...] Six months into the marriage, Jackson asked Gordon for an annulment when in Rome, Italy. In response, Gordon repeatedly bashed her head against the corner of the hotel room table saying that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>let</b> her go. Paparazzi subsequently photographed Jackson with black eyes, which Gordon claimed were caused by an intruder. From this point forward, Jackson lost all contact with her family and wrote an autobiography, , which accused her father of physical abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Fred MacMurray was {{accustomed}} to playing [...] "happy-go-lucky good guys" [...] in light comedies, and when Wilder first approached him about the Neff role, MacMurray said, [...] "You're making the mistake of your life!" [...] Playing a serious role required acting, he said, [...] "and I can't do it." [...] But Wilder pestered him about it every single day – at home, in the studio commissary, in his dressing room, on the sidewalk – until he simply wore the actor down. MacMurray felt safe about his acquiescence since Paramount, who had him under contract and had carefully crafted his good guy image, <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>let</b> him play a [...] "wrong" [...] role. His trust, however, was misplaced: his contract was up for renewal at the time, and ever since his friend and co-star, Carole Lombard, had shrewdly and successfully {{taught him how to}} play hardball with the studio bosses, he wasn't the pliable pushover of old. Paramount executives decided to let him play the unsavory role to teach him a lesson. A lesson was indeed taught, but not the one Paramount had in mind.

[...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch.

The working class Chrétien family were poor, and Chrétien had to wear clothing that had been worn by his siblings as his parents were too poor to buy new clothing for him. Chrétien's parents wanted their children to escape a working class life in Shawinigan by attending classical colleges, which were the only way one could attend university in Quebec at the time. Chrétien's older brother Maurice won a scholarship at the insurance company he was working for, which allowed him to attend medical school, and with the profits from his medical practice to allow his younger siblings to attend the classical colleges. Wellie Chrétien was a staunch Liberal who once got to shake hands {{as a young man}} with his hero, Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>let</b> the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E
