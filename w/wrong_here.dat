25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be <b>wrong</b> <b>here,</b> maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|While Larson {{was running}} up the score, the show's {{producers}} contacted Michael Brockman, then head of CBS's daytime programming department. In a 1994 TV Guide interview commemorating the Larson Sweep, conducted {{at the time the}} movie Quiz Show was released, he recalled [...] "Something was very <b>wrong.</b> <b>Here</b> was this guy from nowhere, and he was hitting the bonus box every time. It was bedlam, I can tell you, and we couldn't stop this guy. He kept going around the board and hitting that box." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{strategically}} indecisive, {{the conduct}} of the battle was sufficient proof of the military awareness of the Arabs even before their campaigns in Persia and Syria. The basic assumption that Arabs were generally raiders and learned warfare from the Persians and Syrians is proved <b>wrong</b> <b>here.</b> Abu Sufyan made full use of his cavalry by deploying them as two mobile wings. The infantry based centre provided the base upon which the cavalry would operate. He intended to pull the celebrated [...] "Double Envelopment" [...] maneuver. He deployed his forces {{in the same manner as}} a Persian or Byzantine general would have done.|$|E

500|$|Dee {{was more}} positive, writing that he [...] "enjoyed it very much" [...] and that [...] "there were some lovely gags." [...] He noted, however, {{that he felt}} it took {{slightly}} too much time {{to set up the}} episode, though after the wife swap, [...] "it marched along." [...] The Times critic Dominic Maxwell thought the [...] "languid timing that Gervais brings to Extras and The Office was <b>wrong</b> <b>here.</b> Simpsons cameos are normally lean, but Gervais's shtick ran rampant through the second half, turning the regulars into extras." [...] Maxwell did find the episode entertaining though, stating that [...] "it was a decent late-period Simpsons episode" [...] and that it featured [...] "some fine jokes." [...] He concluded that [...] "even a middling Simpsons episode is still bright and tight and brilliantly rendered. So even if this one didn’t really work, it was still a lot more fun than a lot of [...] that do." ...|$|E
500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and called it [...] "a {{wonderful}} film." [...] The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as [...] "Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, this gorgeously rendered, high-flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it." [...] Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film [...] "contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction," [...] it also declared that there are scenes in Up of [...] "such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments...to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout ..." [...] Variety enthused that [...] "Up is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's not all about sensory bombardment and volume...Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot <b>wrong</b> <b>here.</b> Vocal performances...exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michel Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative..." [...] The Globe and Mail stated that Up is [...] "the kind of movie that leaves you asking 'How do people {{come up with this}} stuff?'" [...] along with an overall positive review on the film, despite it being predictable.|$|E
2500|$|Two omnibus editions {{were created}} by Douglas Adams to combine the Hitchhiker series novels and to [...] "set the record straight". The stories came in so many {{different}} formats that Adams stated that every time he told it he would contradict himself. Therefore, he stated in the introduction of The More Than Complete Hitchhiker's Guide that [...] "anything I put down <b>wrong</b> <b>here</b> is, as far as I'm concerned, wrong for good." [...] The two omnibus editions were The More Than Complete Hitchhiker's Guide, Complete and Unabridged (published in 1987) and The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide, Complete and Unabridged (published in 1997).|$|E

2500|$|French refused Haig {{permission}} {{to join in}} an attack by Lanrezac, who wrote of French's [...] "bad humour and cowardice". [...] Even Spears felt Sir John was in the <b>wrong</b> <b>here.</b> [...] The BEF also did not join in Lanrezac's attack on German Second Army at Guise (29 August). [...] Joffre, who had spent the morning with Lanrezac, was concerned by rumours that the BEF might retreat towards the Channel Ports. [...] He visited French in the afternoon, urging him to hold {{his place in the}} line promising that Russian successes would soon allow the Allies to attack. [...] However, French insisted that his forces needed 48 hours of absolute rest, and Murray, whom Joffre noticed had been tugging at French's tunic throughout this, then showed an intelligence report of the strength of the German forces facing the BEF. [...] After Joffre had departed in bad humour, French received an incorrect report that Fifth Army was falling back behind the Oise, and issued orders for the BEF to fall back to Rethondes-Soissons; when he received fresh reports that the French were holding their positions after all he replied that {{it was too late to}} cancel his orders. Sir John's opinion of Lanrezac was so low that he did not believe reports of his success at Guise (29 August) until he had sent Seely to interview the French corps commanders.|$|E

500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is no {{liability}} to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf principle to mean that [...] "if anyone was <b>wronged</b> <b>here,</b> it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf." ...|$|R

A woman in my position, you understand, feels {{scarcely}} at her ease among former friends. New faces,--unaccustomed looks,--those only can she tolerate. She would pine among familiar scenes; she would be apt to blush, too, under the eyes that knew her secret; her heart might throb uncomfortably; she would mortify herself, I suppose, with foolish notions of having sacrificed the honor of her sex {{at the foot of}} proud, contumacious man. Poor womanhood, with its rights and <b>wrongs!</b> <b>Here</b> will be new matter for my course of lectures, at the idea of which you smiled, Mr. Coverdale, a month or two ago.
