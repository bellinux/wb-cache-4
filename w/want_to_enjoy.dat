5|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} about possible successor shows, in May 2017 HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth writer {{yet to be}} announced – to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All of the writers are to be working individually with George R. R. Martin. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion are prequels, and some may be set outside Westeros. He also ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff {{said that they would}} not be involved with any of the projects, and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the successor series as fans. Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts. In September 2017, it was announced that Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman would be developing a fifth prequel series.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zach left New Jersey to {{sign with}} the Minnesota Wild on July 4. In an {{interview}} with media from both NJ and Minnesota, he simply states 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the lakes and my time here". After becoming an unrestricted free agent, Parise signed a 13-year contract worth $98 million with the Minnesota Wild. The move represented a homecoming for Parise, {{who grew up in}} the twin cities of Minneapolis–Saint Paul and whose father J. P. Parisé once captained the Minnesota North Stars. Parise joined fellow free agent signee Ryan Suter in signing with the Wild; Suter signed on terms identical to Parise's deal. Parise would wear number 11 with the Wild, the same number that his father J. P. wore with the North Stars, as number 9 was already taken by team captain Mikko Koivu. Both Parise and Suter were named alternate captains for the Wild on July 10.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – {{they just want to}} do it when they get to the surface. The solitude they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E
