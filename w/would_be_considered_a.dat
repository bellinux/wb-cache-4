5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|Narvesen had an {{exclusive}} agreement with NSB to operate newsagent's shops at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended {{to create a}} foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties {{finding a way to}} transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if {{it was part of a}} restructuring. A merger with Spisevognselskapet <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> restructuring, and in 1974 Fritt Ord was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the Conservative Party and Progress Party voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen–Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} folk metal bands were Skyclad from England and Cruachan from Ireland. Skyclad's {{debut album}} The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth {{was released in}} 1991 and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> thrash metal album with some folk influences, unlike Cruachan’s early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond. Among these early groups, the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It {{was not until the}} early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.|$|E

5|$|The victory {{claims that}} were made by each side in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads, based as both were on misinterpretations of the opponent's behavior, have been dismissed by present-day historians. They agree that the result of the Monitor–Merrimack encounter was not a victory for either side. As the combat between ironclads was the primary significance of the battle, the general verdict is that the overall result was a draw. All would acknowledge that the Southern fleet inflicted far more damage than it received, which would ordinarily imply that they had gained a tactical victory. Compared to other Civil War battles, the loss of men and ships for the Union Navy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> clear defeat. On the other hand, the blockade was not seriously threatened, so the entire battle can be regarded as an assault that ultimately failed.|$|E
5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E

50|$|By contrast, Ibn Tufail's Hayy ibn Yaqdhan and Ibn al-Nafis' Theologus Autodidactus are {{works of}} didactic {{philosophy}} and theology. In this sense, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>an</b> early {{example of a}} philosophical novel, while Theologus Autodidactus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>an</b> early theological novel. Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, with its story of a human outcast surviving on an island, {{is also likely to}} have influenced Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), because the work was available in an English edition in 1711.|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, when a {{false belief}} {{involves}} a value judgment, {{it is only}} considered a delusion if it is so extreme that it cannot be, or never can be proven true.

25|$|The street did, therefore, provide {{dwellings}} for artisans and labourers. Accommodation {{would have}} been rented out to these occupants.

25|$|Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (OC 1:157), {{based on}} the N'mukei Yosef (Bava Batra 53b), the Ran (ibid. 121b), the Rashbam (ibid), and the Eliyah Rabba, extends the {{possibility}} of breaking the fast to include even breaking it at a festive meal celebrating the completion of any mitzvah (commandment) that had required regular, continual involvement. According to these authorities, such a meal <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> seudat mitzvah of adequate caliber to exempt one from continuing the fast.|$|E

It is sometimes possible for a woman to receive special dispensation from a halachic authority, called a heter agunah, based on a complex decision supported by substantial evidence that her husband is presumed dead.|$|E
25|$|In the past, remains {{have been}} {{attributed}} to the same genus as the Judith River Troodon {{from a wide variety of}} other geological formations. It is now recognized as unlikely that all of these fossils, which come from localities hundreds or thousands of miles apart, separated by millions of years of time, represent a single species or genus of troodontid dinosaurs. Further study and more fossils are needed to determine how many species of Troodon existed. It is questionable that, after further study, any additional species can be referred to Troodon, in which case the genus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> nomen dubium.|$|E
25|$|Biddle soon {{changed his}} mind, as he {{approved}} {{a modified version}} of the plan on 21 January 1945, likely due to time constraints, since the trial would be one of the main issues discussed at Yalta. At trial, the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes, such as the SS or Gestapo, who had joined after 1939 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> war criminal. Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations.|$|E

25|$|Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, {{commander}} of the U.S. 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain across the Persian Gulf from Iran, warned that such Iranian action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>an</b> act of war, and the U.S. would not allow Iran to hold hostage {{nearly a third of}} the world's oil supply.|$|R

The single small urethral/vaginal opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> hypospadias in a male. X-rays taken after dye injection into this opening reveal the internal connection with the upper vagina and uterus. This common opening can predispose to urinary obstruction and infection.|$|E
25|$|The final fall {{took two}} days, May 6 and 7, {{during which the}} French fought on but were {{eventually}} overrun by a huge frontal assault. General Cogny, based in Hanoi, ordered General de Castries, who was commanding the outpost, to cease fire at 5:30pm and to destroy all materiél (weapons, transmissions, etc.) to deny their use to the enemy. A formal order was given to not use the white flag so that the action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> ceasefire instead of a surrender. Much of the fighting ended on May 7; however, the ceasefire was not respected on Isabelle, the isolated southern position, where the battle lasted until May 8, 1:00am.|$|E
25|$|After the {{evacuation}} of their forces from Bornholm, the Soviets took {{the position that the}} stationing of foreign troops on Bornholm <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> declaration of war against the Soviet Union, and that Denmark should keep troops on it at all times to protect it from such foreign aggression. This policy remained in force after NATO was formed, with Denmark as a founding member. The Soviets accepted the stationing there of Danish troops, which were part of NATO but viewed as militarily inferior elements of the alliance, but they strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on Bornholm, in particular of US troops.|$|E
