40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{compared}} coronal loops in the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) with coronal loops from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). The purpose {{of which is to}} quantitatively and qualitatively examine the effects of spatial resolution on the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> coronal <b>loops</b> and implications for how a coronal loop is defined. Out <b>of</b> twenty-two <b>loop</b> sections analyzed, we find that none of them were resolved in EIT and none of them were close to the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the TRACE <b>loops.</b> These findings suggest that coronal loops are unresolved in EIT. We also find examples <b>of</b> how unresolved <b>loops</b> can be quite misleading. We have also found that many <b>of</b> the TRACE <b>loops</b> that we have analyzed may be unresolved as well.

40|$|The scale {{heights of}} {{stratification}} and the <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> steady solar coronal loops exhibit properties unexplained by standard theory: observed scale heights are often {{much greater than}} static theory predicts, while the nearly-constant <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>loop</b> emission signatures defy theoretical expectations for large flux tubes in stratified media. In this work we relate the cross-sectional profile of a coronal flux tube to its density scale height in steady-state plasma flow regimes. Steady flows may shorten or lengthen the scale height according to how the tube cross-sectional area varies with arclength. In a near-potential corona the flux tubes {{are expected to be}} sufficiently expansive in many active regions for scale heights to be increased by steady flows. On the other hand, cases where scale lengths are actually increased to observed sizes form {{a small part of the}} solution space, close to regimes where density profiles reverse. Therefore, although steady flows are the only steady process known to be capable of extending scale heights significantly, they are not expected to be not responsible for the majority of extended active region scale heights...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} calculating the resonance absorption heating rate is discussed {{and the results}} are compared with observations in the solar corona. To accomplish this, the wave equation for a dissipative, compressible plasma is derived from the linearized magnetohydrodynamic equations for a plasma with transverse Alfven speed gradients. For parameters representative of the solar corona, it is found that a two-scale description of the wave motion is appropriate. The large-scale motion, which can be approximated as nearly ideal, has a scale which is on the order <b>of</b> the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loop.</b> The small-scale wave, however, has a transverse scale much smaller than the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loop,</b> with a <b>width</b> <b>of</b> about 0. 3 - 250 km, and is highly dissipative. These two wave motions are coupled in a narrow resonance region in the loop where the global wave frequency equals the local Alfven wave frequency. Formally, this coupling comes about from using the method of matched asymptotic expansions to match the inner and outer (small and large scale) solutions. The resultant heating rate can be calculated from either of these solutions. A formula derived using the outer (ideal) solution is presented, and shown to be consistent with observations of heating and line broadening in the solar corona...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Hi-C images in order to {{investigate}} absolute limits for the finest loop strands. We develop {{a model of the}} occurrence-size distribution function <b>of</b> coronal <b>loop</b> <b>widths,</b> characterized by a lower limit <b>of</b> <b>widths</b> w_min, a peak width w_p, a peak occurrence number n_p, and a power law slope a. Our data analysis includes automated tracing of curvi-linear features with the OCCULT- 2 code, automated sampling <b>of</b> the cross-sectional <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> coronal <b>loops,</b> and fitting <b>of</b> the theoretical size distribution to the observed distribution. With Monte-Carlo simulations and variable pixel sizes Δ x we derive a first diagnostic criterion to discriminate whether the loop widths are unresolved (w_p/Δ x ≈ 2. 5 ± 0. 2), or fully resolved (if w_p/Δ x > 2. 7). For images with resolved loop widths we can apply a second diagnostic criterion that predicts the lower limit <b>of</b> <b>loop</b> <b>widths,</b> w_min≈ 3 (Δ x_crit- 0. 37 ") {{as a function of the}} critical resolution Δ x_crit. We find that the loop widths are marginally resolved in AIA images, but are fully resolved in Hi-C images, where our model predicts a lower limit <b>of</b> <b>loop</b> <b>widths</b> at w_min≈ 100 km and a most frequent (peak) value at w_p ≈ 300 km, in agreement with recent results of Brooks et al. This result agrees with the statistics of photospheric granulation sizes and thus supports coronal heating mechanisms operating on the macroscopic scale of photospheric magneto-convection, rather than nanoflare heating models with unresolved microscopic scales.

Decreasing {{the size of}} the molecular system from macroscopic (bulk) down to nanometric scale can provide unique insight into fundamentals of spin transition properties, with applications to nanoelectronics and spintronics [7, 8].
