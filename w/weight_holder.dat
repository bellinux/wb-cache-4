Adhesion requirements for photovoltaic modules to ensure reliability are often discussed but not well defined, neither in terms of tests nor actual requirements. This paper presents a new approach for realistic assessment of the adhesion strength, which shows the conventional peel test may not ensure reliability. The test presented reproduces the actual adhesion requirements for fielded modules much more closely than the commonly used peel testing. The test is conducted in-situ during standard damp-heat test at a temperature of 85 °C and 85 % relative humidity, with the modules installed {{at an angle to}} give an appropriate force vector perpendicular to the backsheet. This is achieved by attaching weights {{to the back of the}} tested samples which are mounted with a 45 ° angle on a testing rack in the environmental cabinet. With an appropriate <b>weight</b> <b>holder,</b> this could be done as part of the standard damp-heat cycle during certification and would not involve additional testing time nor significant changes in the commonly used racking. This approach will identify the weakest interface of the multilayer encapsulation system. A number of test-to-fail bespoke samples are tested to set realistic fail criteria. It is shown that the test allows discrimination between different samples and can identify unsuitable production processes...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a novel and {{elementary}} proof of existence and uniqueness of Gibbs states for <b>Holder</b> <b>weight</b> systems. A bonus {{of this approach}} is that it leads directly to a decomposition of the measure as an integral of a canonical ratio function with respect to a measure which is dual to the Gibbs state. See the corollary to Theorem 1 for the precise statement. The novelty of our approach is to use a notion of duality and to combine it with the approach to constructing measures pioneered by Paterson [2] {{in the context of the}} limit sets of Fuchsian groups and used by Sullivan [5] to construct conformal measures for Julia sets. This duality plays the central role in our approach through the following observations: (i) given a Holder function J on the shift space Σ (or, equivalently, a <b>Holder</b> <b>weight</b> system) there is a unique measure on Σ whose Jacobian is J, (ii) the weight system determined by determines a unique measur...|$|R
40|$|Global well-posedness of the {{time-dependent}} (degenerate) thermistor problem {{remains open}} for many years. In this paper, we {{solve the problem}} by establishing a uniform-in-time BMO estimate of inhomogeneous parabolic equations. Applying this estimate to the temperature equation, we derive a BMO bound of the temperature uniform with respect to time, which implies that the electric conductivity is a A_ 2 <b>weight.</b> The <b>Hölder</b> continuity of the electric potential is then proved by applying the De Giorgi [...] Nash [...] Moser estimate for degenerate elliptic equations with A_ 2 coefficient. Uniqueness of solution is proved based on the established regularity of the weak solution.

50|$|Beynon's term as the bantam <b>weight</b> title <b>holder</b> {{was short}} lived, as after {{a win over}} Frenchman Robert Dastillon, he failed in his first defence of the belt, against Digger Stanley; losing {{in the same way}} as he won, by points over 20 rounds. Beynon's later career never {{reflected}} the success of his early career, losing the majority of his challenges. Beynon faced several notable fighters, included a win over past British flyweight champion Joe Symonds in 1921 and two knockout losses to Charles Ledoux, European bantamweight champion. When Beynon first faced Ledoux, it was for the European bantamweight championship title, and he lost the fight after being forced to retire in the eighth round after his eyebrow was split. The second challenge against Ledoux was far more clear cut, with the Frenchman outboxing Beynon at close-quarters, and won the contest by knockout in the eighth.|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} (Muckenhoupt) weights arises {{in many areas}} of analysis, for example in {{connection}} with bounds for singular integrals and maximal functions on weighted spaces. We prove that a certain averaging process gives a method for constructing A_p weights from a measurably varying family of dyadic A_p weights. This averaging process is suggested by the relationship between the A_p weight class and the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. The same averaging process also constructs <b>weights</b> satisfying reverse <b>Holder</b> (RH_p) conditions from families of dyadic RH_p weights, and extends to the polydisc as well.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that the union of the Reverse Hölder classes coincides with the union of the Muckenhoupt classes A_p, but the A_∞ {{constant}} of the weight w, which is a limit of its A_p constants, is not a natural characterization for the <b>weight</b> in Reverse <b>Hölder</b> classes. We introduce the RH_ 1 condition as a limiting case of the RH_p inequalities as p tends to 1. Then we show sharp bound on RH_ 1 constant of the weight w {{in terms of its}} A_∞ constant (from above and from below). We also prove the sharp version of the Gehring theorem for the case p= 1, completing the answer to the famous question of Bojarski in dimension one.

40|$|Matrix Szego biorthogonal polynomials for quasi-definite {{matrices}} {{of measures}} are studied. For matrices of <b>Holder</b> <b>weights</b> a Riemann-Hilbert problem is uniquely solved {{in terms of}} the matrix Szego polynomials and its Cauchy transforms. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is given as an appropriate framework for the discussion of the Szego matrix and the associated Szego recursion relations for the matrix orthogonal polynomials and its Cauchy transforms. Pearson type differential systems characterizing the matrix of weights are studied. These are linear systems of ordinary differential equations which are required to be monodromy free. Linear ordinary differential equations for the matrix Szego polynomials and its Cauchy transforms are derived. It is shown how these Pearson systems lead to nonlinear difference equations for the Verblunsky matrices and two examples, of Fuchsian and non-Fuchsian type, are considered. For both cases a new matrix version of the discrete Painlevé II equation for the Verblunsky matrices is found. Reductions of these matrix discrete Painleve II systems presenting locality are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Dedicated to Heisuke Hironaka on the {{occasion}} of his seventy seventh birthday Abstract. We extend to higher dimension our valuative analysis of singularities of psh functions started in [FJ 2]. Following [KoSo], we describe the geometry of the space V of all normalized valuations on C[z 1, [...] ., zn] centered at the origin. It is a union of simplices naturally endowed with an affine structure. Using relative positivity properties of divisors living on modifications of C n over the origin, we construct a natural class of convex functions on V. For bounded convex functions on V, we define a mixed Monge-Ampère operator which reflects the intersection theory of divisors over the origin of C n. This operator associates to any (n − 1) -tuple gi of such functions a positive measure of finite mass MA (gi) on V. Next, we show that the collection of Lelong numbers of a given germ of a psh function at all infinitely near points induces a convex function gu on V. When ϕ is a psh <b>Hölder</b> <b>weight</b> in the sense of Demailly [De], the generalized Lelong number νϕ(u) equals R gu MA (gϕ). I...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend to}} higher {{dimensions}} {{some of the}} valuative analysis of singularities of plurisubharmonic (psh) functions developed by the last two authors. Following Kontsevich and Soibelman we describe the geometry of the space V of all normalized valuations on C[x_ 1, [...] .,x_n] centered at the origin. It is a union of simplices naturally endowed with an affine structure. Using relative positivity properties of divisors living on modifications of C^n above the origin, we define formal psh functions on V, designed to be analogues of the usual psh functions. For bounded formal psh functions on V, we define a mixed Monge-Ampere operator which reflects the intersection theory of divisors above the origin of C^n. This operator associates to any (n- 1) -tuple of formal psh functions a positive measure of finite mass on V. Next, we show that the collection of Lelong numbers of a given germ u of a psh function at all infinitely near points induces a formal psh function u' on V called its valuative transform. When ϕ is a psh <b>Holder</b> <b>weight</b> {{in the sense of}} Demailly, the generalized Lelong number nu_ϕ(u) equals the integral of u' against the Monge-Ampere measure of the valuative transform of ϕ. In particular, any generalized Lelong number is an average of valuations. We also show how to compute the multiplier ideal of u and the relative type of u with respect to ϕ in the sense of Rashkovskii, in terms of the valuative transforms of u and ϕ. Comment: 37 pages, new version. Changed the terminology from convex fonctions to formal psh functions. Corrected statement about the continuity of formal psh functions.
