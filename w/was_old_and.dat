5|$|The Fasti Ostienses, the Ostian Calendar, {{records that}} {{the same day the}} Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor. Despite his {{political}} experience, this was a remarkable choice. Nerva <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian's assassination.|$|E
5|$|Abbey of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) was {{designed}} in 1878 by J.E. Gnudtzmann in the Neo-Romanesque style. The original Church of Our Lady {{from the early}} 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation because it <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> unstable, but the 12th-century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen. The carved pulpit dates to around 1581.|$|E

5|$|According to Yuri Moshnik, {{a modern}} historian, the {{garrison}} at Viborg in 1710 stood at 6000 men; other modern historians B. Adamovich and A. I. Dubravin {{put the number}} at 4000. Since 1702, the commander there had been Zacharias Animoff, who <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> in poor health. For that reason, in February 1710, Colonel Magnus Stiernstråle officially replaced him; he had de facto headed the efforts to fortify the city.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were not}} to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad <b>was</b> <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> the club failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were {{competitive}} during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club {{spent most of the}} 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity. Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|On 18 September, 96, Domitian {{was assassinated}} in a palace {{conspiracy}} organised by court officials.

5|$|Henry died in 1542 and his son, Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, {{inherited}} the family estates. During the Rising of the North, in which Catholic magnates rebelled against ElizabethI, Henry remained {{loyal to the}} Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family. He dismantled Appleby Castle {{to prevent it from}} being used against royal forces, {{and at the same time}} put Brougham at the service of the Elizabethan government, although there was no fighting at the castle. Under the second and third earls, Henry and George, the castle was still used as a residence, with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle. However, it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted. George Clifford spent much time either in southern England in his role as Queen's Champion or at Skipton. An inventory of the castle's contents in 1595 demonstrates that the structure was a neglected, meagrely furnished place, and what little furniture there <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> in disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, but he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> {{physically}} impaired {{when he met}} Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E

5|$|In late April all the factions {{except the}} Flying Squadron had disappeared, and the {{cardinals}} {{had agreed to}} elect Emilio Altieri. On 29 April 1670 Altieri received three votes at the scrutiny in the morning, which was the same number he had received consistently {{since the beginning of}} the conclave. At the afternoon scrutiny, he received twenty-one votes, and was shortly acclaimed pope by an additional thirty-five cardinals. This brought his final total to fifty-six out of a total possible of fifty-nine electors. Altieri <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> was in poor health, and resisted his own election to the point where he had to be dragged out of his room by two cardinals in order to be acclaimed. His election took place at 3 pm, but he resisted being elected for an hour. He took the name Clement in honour of Clement IX, who had created him a cardinal. At the age of 79, Altieri is the oldest person to have been elected pope.|$|E

At peak operation {{toward the end of the}} war, the PE dispatched over 10,000 trains daily and was a major employer in Southern California. However, the equipment in use <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> suffered from deferred maintenance.|$|E
25|$|King Charles III, {{feeling that}} the {{national}} pride of Spain had been offended by the Algerines, resolved to punish them by bombarding their town. Rear admiral Antonio Barceló was appointed {{to carry out the}} attack. Though he was by far the most capable naval officer of Spain {{and one of the few}} who had risen through the ranks by merit, Barceló's designation was coldly received both by the Spanish court and military. The Rear admiral <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> illiterate and of humble extraction, which, together with his naval victories, earned him the envy of most the senior Spanish officers.|$|E
25|$|Because Mannerheim <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> sickly, he {{personally}} wrote only certain passages of his memoirs. Some other parts he dictated and described. The remaining parts {{were written by}} Mannerheim's various assistants, such as Colonel Aladár Paasonen; General Erik Heinrichs; Generals Grandell, Olenius and Martola; and Colonel Viljanen, a war historian. As long as Mannerheim was able to read, he proofread the typewritten drafts of his memoirs. He was almost totally silent about his private life, and focused instead on Finland's events, especially on those between 1917 and 1944. When Mannerheim suffered a fatal stomach attack in January 1951, his memoirs were not yet in their finished form. They were published after his death.|$|E

25|$|In June 1994, {{the family}} lived at 65 Every Street, Andersons Bay, Dunedin. The house <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> 'semi-derelict'. At this time Robin and Margaret were estranged. Robin was {{initially}} {{sleeping in the}} back of his van at Taieri, but more recently in the schoolhouse three nights a week. He returned to the family home at weekends but slept in a caravan in the back garden. David was studying music and classics at Otago University and had a part-time job delivering morning newspapers. Arawa was attending a teachers' training college and Stephen was at high school. Laniet had a part-time job in Dunedin and lived away from home, but had returned to the family residence on the Sunday evening of 19 June to attend a family meeting.|$|E
25|$|However, by {{the time}} he was {{released}} Francesco Crocco <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> sick and this left Crocco to act as head of his family, working as a farmer in Rionero. Here he met don Ferdinando, don Vincenzo's son, who felt regret for his father's behavior against the family. Don Ferdinando offered him a job as a farmer on his property, but Crocco preferred to take money instead, which he used to avoid the military service, as during the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, service was avoidable upon payment. The nobleman accepted but was killed on 15 May 1848 in Naples by some Swiss troops. Thus Crocco had to join Ferdinand II's army, but he deserted as a result of killing a comrade in a brawl. In his absence, his sister Rosina had to take care of the family.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{army was}} under the overall command of Field Marshal Mikhail Kamensky, but he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> {{becoming}} infirm. The Russian First Army of some 55,000 to 68,000 men, commanded by Count Bennigsen, had fallen back from the Vistula {{to the line of}} the River Wkra, in order to unite with the Second Army, about 37,000 strong, under Buxhowden, which was approaching from Russia and was still some 15 days march from the First Army. However, realising his mistake in allowing the French to cross the Vistula, Kamensky advanced at the beginning of December to try to regain the line of the river. French forces crossed the Narew River at Modlin on 10 December, and the Prussian Corps commanded by Lestocq failed to retake Thorn. This led Bennigsen on 11 December to issue orders to fall back and hold the line of the River Wkra.|$|E
