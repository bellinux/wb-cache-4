500|$|Contemporary reviews have {{praised the}} episode {{as one of}} the show's best installments. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that the episode was [...] "funny, it's clever, and it's {{actually}} quite frightening". Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the faux documentary style, likening it to The Blair Witch Project. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and called it [...] "witty, inventive, and intermittently spooky". He argued that the episode was a late-series [...] "gimmick episode" [...] and compared it to the last few seasons of House; although he reasoned that House relied on gimmicks to prop itself up, [...] "X-Cops" [...] is [...] "the work of a creative team which may be running out of ideas, but still has enough gas in the tank to get us <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] Furthermore, Handlen felt that the show used the Cops format to the best of its ability, and that many of the scenes were humorous, startling, or a combination of both.|$|E

The Steelers's defense held the Vikings early, led by Aaron Smith who had three tackles, including one sack, in the first quarter. The offense failed to score a touchdown, with Rashard Mendenhall fumbling twice. Quarterback Byron Leftwich, who was signed to replace the injured Batch, lead the team with 129yards passing. Jeff Reed accounted {{for all of the}} Steelers' points, kicking four field goals—the final with 4seconds remaining—to give Pittsburgh a 12–10 victory. Entering their final pre-season game the Steelers had selected every starting player except the punter. Carolina tied the game with 1:54remaining in regulation, but rookie Dennis Dixon lead the Steelers on a 47-yard drive, which was capped with Reed kicking the game winning 43-yard field goal as time expired. After the three point victory, Tomlin stated, [...] "It has been a pleasure working with this group guys, but it is that time of year <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make tough decisions." [...] The Steelers cut 22players on August 30, to bring their roster to the required 53player total.
