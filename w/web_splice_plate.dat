40|$|In this research, {{in order}} to {{investigate}} frictional behavior, maximum strength and relaxation behavior of the frictional joints made of GFRP members connected by high strength bolts and <b>splice</b> <b>plates,</b> the slip test and the bolt relaxation test were conducted. The test specimens were prepared, which consisted of high strength bolts, connected plates made of GFRP and <b>splice</b> <b>plates</b> made of GFRP or stainless. The FE analysis was also executed to study mechanism of the stress concentration around the holes of the frictional joints and to estimate its maximum strength.

The bolt relaxation test for a year provided that the reduction of the bolt axial force of the specimen with the stainless <b>splice</b> <b>plates</b> was less than 5 % and lower than that of the specimen using the GFRP <b>splice</b> <b>plates.</b> From the FE analysis results, the maximum strength of the GFRP frictional bolted joint could calculate based on considering the stress concentration...|$|R

The joints were fabricated with two and six pultruded GFRP <b>splice</b> <b>plates.</b> Three <b>splice</b> <b>plate</b> lengths were investigated and two bolt torques {{were used to}} tighten the bolts. Each of the twelve splice joint combinations was subjected to three repeat tests up to the serviceability deflection limit.

During each test loads, support rotations, splice joint end rotations and mid-span surface strains were recorded for each mid-span deflection increment. The beams’ transverse stiffnesses and splice joints’ rotational stiffnesses were derived from the test data. The variation of the stiffnesses with <b>splice</b> <b>plate</b> length, number of <b>splice</b> <b>plates</b> and bolt torque was also quantified. A simple analysis was developed for splice-jointed beams and was used to predict the transverse and rotational stiffnesses determined from the test data.

30|$|This note {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} an improved slotted bolted connection for timber moment frames. In the improved connection, steel tubes are inserted into drill holes in glulam and fixed to the glulam with resin injection. Aluminum <b>splice</b> <b>plates</b> with curved slots, or curved elongated holes, are fastened mechanically by using high-strength bolts that go through the steel tubes. Since the compression due to bolt tension is fully supported by the steel tubes, the reduction of bolt tension due to shrinkage of the glulam can be avoided. The use of slotted aluminum <b>splice</b> <b>plates</b> allows stable energy dissipation due to smooth sliding between the aluminum <b>splice</b> <b>plates</b> and the end surfaces of the steel tubes within the specified range of rotation angle. Through quasistatic cyclic loading tests of two connection specimens, it was demonstrated that stable and nearly rigid-plastic hysteresis loops were obtained whose equivalent viscous damping ratio was more than 30 % {{in the range of}} rotation angle close to or greater than 1 / 50 radian. Although further improvement is necessary, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the present connection.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>spliced</b> <b>plates</b> on an {{aircraft}} with wing mounted power plant {{are subject to}} sequentially applied tensile and shear load cycles, with far more tensile cycles than shear cycles. This paper aims to propose an approach to address the fatigue crack growth under this scenario. Current understanding on fatigue crack growth behaviours was reviewed, focusing on crack surface interferences and fatigue crack growth mechanisms under non-proportional mixed-mode loads. A generic <b>spliced</b> <b>plate</b> was analysed using non-linear finite element modelling. The analysis revealed shear-induced-bearing at fastener holes, and predicted both shear-induced- IK and shear-induced- IIK at a 0 ° crack emanating from the fastener hole edge. When the crack is short relative to the fastener hole radius, the shear-induced- IK is dominant therefore {{it has the potential}} to cause shear-induced mode I overload. As the crack grows longer, the shear-induce- IIK increases, and depending on the load level, this may lead to both short-range acceleration and long-range retardation. Through the above analysis, the engineering problem of fatigue crack growth in a <b>spliced</b> <b>plate</b> under sequential tensile and shear loads was converted into a more generally understood problem of fatigue crack growth under cyclic mode I plus intermittent cyclic mixed-mode loads...|$|R

40|$|In the literature, the {{designing}} of the rolled or welded, doubly symmetrical I- and H-profile bolted splice {{is usually}} {{presented with a}} load combination, which includes axial load, shear {{in one direction and}} bending in respect of strong axis. Because there often exists a load combination with biaxial bending simultaneously, the design method for calculating bolt shear forces in this situation is needed. To design the joint reliable, the distribution of the forces in the joint must be known well. In the nonbearing type joint, the forces of the splice are usually supposed to be distributed in the ratio of the cross-section stiffnesses. With this method, generally acceptable results have been achieved for the joint member stresses. In the bearing type joint, the distribution of the forces for the bolts and <b>splice</b> <b>plates</b> is not as clear as with the non-bearing type splice. In this research, the stiffnesses of the splice members has been used for calculating stresses also in the bearing type splice.

One element per layer approach is employed in through-the-thickness direction to model the laminated composite plate. The bolt and the washer are modeled as a single linear elastic deformable solid body. Surface-to-surface contact elements are used to define the contact behavior between the joint members including the effect of friction. Comparison of the stress results show that the clamping force has a significantly different effect for composite and aluminum plates. Initial clamping force introduces beneficial compressive stresses for aluminum plate whereas both tensile and compressive stresses occur for the composite laminate. The stress analysis results are used to explain the phenomena behind the different clamping force responses...|$|R

The method used to fabricate three beams, {{each with a}} six-plate bonded splice joint at mid-span, is outlined. Details of the instrumentation used to measure deflections, etc. during three-point flexure tests on the beams are given. Deflections, support rotations and mid-span strains recorded during the tests are presented. Formulae, based on shear deformation beam theory, are presented for predicting the centre deflection and the support rotations of the beams. It is shown that they predict deflections and rotations with a maximum error of about 10 %, provided the elastic moduli are derived from coupon tests rather than the manufacturer's minimum values. The theory is extended to provide a simple method, based on the solution of a quadratic equation, for determining the optimum and limiting splice length ratios for particular values of the additional cross-sectional area and additional {{second moment of area}} factors and the shear flexibility parameter.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{extending}} the applicability of structural stress method for fatigue assessment of welded structures is discussed. The structural stress method for plate structures, as currently presented in commonly used design guidance documents, cannot account the effect of weld size and load carrying fillet welds are assessed using a different S-N curve as compared to non-load carrying fillet welds. The current proposal is to linearize the local stress distribution through the plate thickness in {{the plane of the}} weld toe and, thus, partially capture the local effect. A bilinear stress distribution is derived from the actual non-linear stress distribution based on equilibrium. A simple procedure is presented to determine the bilinear curve from the nominal weld stress. This is a great advantage in finite element analysis when only nominal base plate stress and nominal weld stresses need to be determined. The same weld stresses can be used also in the analysis of the root cracks. The proposed method was scaled to correspond to the traditional structural stress method using detailed linear elastic fracture mechanics simulations. The method is here applied only to fully load-carrying welds but can also be used for partial load-carrying welds. A symmetric <b>splice</b> <b>plate</b> having a fully loaded fillet weld is presented as an example case. The influence of base plate thickness is also studied. ...|$|R
