5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him to hold his dinner reservations. Before they can leave church, Elisa tells Jack {{that they need to}} go to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a sign from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E

500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode and specific elements of it, like Michael {{wandering around the}} office drunk {{and many of the}} documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being too lazy to compliment Michael in person. But he said the episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to finally see them get to do it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{second part}} of the season, which begins with episode 11, takes place three months after the events of episode 10. On the {{structure}} of the season and shifting the focus between the two parts, Bell stated it was the intent to follow the format from season two, by tying [...] "a whole bunch of [...] but not all of them off by the midseason. And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, we feel that the season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes {{of what it means to}} be human and Inhuman. What does it mean to all these people <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person? Is everybody capable of everything if put in a terrible position? Or is there true good and a true evil?" [...] The second half of the season sees the introduction of the comics' right-wing hate group the Watchdogs, depicted as radicals wishing to [...] "eliminate the Inhumans", as well as a [...] "cure" [...] that can prevent terrigenisis in yet-to-transition Inhumans.|$|E

2500|$|The Muggles remain, for {{the most}} part, {{oblivious}} to the wizarding world, a situation considered preferable to the alternative by wizards. Most things of magical nature are hidden or otherwise obscured from Muggles; others (such as Dementors) are invisible to them, although they experience the same depression and sense of manifest darkness and despair while near a Dementor. It is commented that Muggles generally dismiss anything they cannot explain. [...] Likewise, to many magical people, many functional aspects of the Muggle world are rarely glimpsed and mysterious. Wizards and witches' attempts to disguise themselves as Muggles, as <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> venture out onto [...] "normal" [...] streets, often have humorous results. The mispronunciation of common Muggle terms like [...] "telephone", [...] "escalator", [...] "plumber", [...] "firearms" [...] or [...] "policeman", as [...] "fellytone", [...] "escapator", [...] "pumble", [...] "firelegs", and [...] "please-men", respectively, is a running gag in the series.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these difficulties, fMRI {{has been}} used {{clinically}} to map functional areas, check left-right hemispherical asymmetry in language and memory regions, check the neural correlates of a seizure, study how the brain recovers partially from a stroke, test how well a drug or behavioral therapy works, detect the onset of Alzheimer's, and note the presence of disorders like depression. Mapping of functional areas and understanding lateralization of language and memory help surgeons avoid removing critical brain regions <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> operate and remove brain tissue. [...] This is of particular importance in removing tumors and in patients who have intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Lesioning tumors requires pre-surgical planning to ensure no functionally useful tissue is removed needlessly. Recovered depressed patients have shown altered fMRI activity in the cerebellum, and this may indicate a tendency to relapse. Pharmacological fMRI, assaying brain activity after drugs are administered, {{can be used to}} check how much a drug penetrates the blood–brain barrier and dose vs effect information of the medication.|$|E
2500|$|When Nicholas {{manages to}} escape from the house, he goes to Louisa's home, where he finds Jo's {{encyclopedia}} (which Jo had brought through the mirror to show to Louisa and her brother Titus <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> write an essay about the Roman Empire). Intrigued by colour photographs, Nicholas checks for information about the Russian Royal Family. To his horror, he reads that Nicholas II, the Tsar of Russia, and his family, had been executed. When Jo and Louisa come into the room, Nicholas asks Jo where she got the book and demands that she tell him if the information is correct. Jo says that the book was given to her by her Dad and that the information is correct. Nicholas reveals to Jo and Louisa that he is Alexei Nikolaevich, the son of the Tsar, and that it is his family who had been executed. Sir Ivor's treachery is finally revealed. Instead of caring for Nicholas, Sir Ivor had actually brought Nicholas to New Zealand so that he could 'sell' Nicholas to the highest bidder [...] Russian Bolsheviks, who want to take Nicholas back to Russia with them so that Nicholas, the last surviving member of the Russian Royal Family, can be publicly executed.|$|E

2500|$|The Doctor's {{relationship}} with Rose intensifies after he regenerates into the Tenth Doctor. In [...] "New Earth", Rose's body is temporarily inhabited by Cassandra, who kisses the Doctor romantically. This {{is one of}} the few scenes in the entire programme where the Doctor is kissed romantically by his companion. In [...] "School Reunion", the arrival of the Doctor's previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. The Doctor also expresses dismay at having his companions age while he regenerates. In the episode, [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace" [...] (written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor falls in love with Madame de Pompadour, with whom he shares a passionate kiss and a strong romantic connection. She even takes him away to [...] "dance", but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode [...] "The Doctor Dances") is taken is not seen on screen. Rose does not openly exhibit jealousy towards Madame de Pompadour. In the novel The Stone Rose, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, although it is described as [...] "a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive." [...] In [...] "The Impossible Planet" [...] the Doctor and Rose share an awkward moment <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consider settling down in one time period and Rose suggests they do so together. She later plants a kiss for good luck on the Doctor's spacesuit prior to his descent into the pit. In [...] "The Satan Pit" [...] the Doctor, fearing for his life, tells someone [...] "If you see Rose, tell her... tell her... oh, she knows". In [...] "Doomsday", when the Doctor says his goodbye to Rose, she finally tells him that she loves him. He begins to reply, but the message is cut off, and he is unable to reciprocate; in the episode's audio commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner had stated that [...] "he absolutely was going to say it... he was going to tell her he loved her." ...|$|E
