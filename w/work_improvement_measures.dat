40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} the prevalence and {{factors associated with}} high job strain among office workers of a multinational company in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} November 2007 among 470 eligible workers. Respondents self-administered the Job Content Questionnaire downloaded from the company's intranet. A median-split procedure was applied to create four groups according to the Job Demand-Control Model: active, passive, high and low job strain. Logistic regression models were used to {{investigate the}} associations between socio-demographic, occupational and psychosocial factors and high job strain. Results A total of 356 questionnaires were received (response rate 76). Twenty-one per cent of respondents were in the high job strain group, 35 were in the passive group, whereas 26 and 17 of workers were in the low strain and active groups, respectively. After controlling for confounders, three factors were found to be associated with high job strain: male workers (adjusted OR 1. 94, 95 CI 1. 04 - 3. 64), working > 48 h per week (adjusted OR 2. 51, 95 CI 1. 44 - 4. 39) and job insecurity (adjusted OR 1. 14, 95 CI 1. 02 - 1. 27). One protective factor for high job strain was the scale 'created skill', which is part of skill discretion (adjusted OR 0. 70, 95 CI 0. 57 - 0. 86). Conclusions About one in five workers in this study experience high job strain. <b>Work</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> include reducing long working hours and job insecurity and giving workers the opportunity to learn, use creativity and develop abilities...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study aims {{to promote}} {{occupational}} {{health in the}} informal sector in Thailand by using a participatory approach. The success of the intervention {{is based on an}} evaluation of the informal sector workers' a) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in occupational health and safety, b) <b>work</b> practice <b>improvement,</b> and c) working condition improvement. METHODS: This study applies the Participatory Action Research (PAR) method. The participants of the study consisted of four local occupations in different regions of Thailand, including a ceramic making group in the North, a plastic weaving group in the Central region, a blanket making group in the Northeast, and a pandanus weaving group in the South. Data was collected using both qualitative and quantitative methods through questionnaires, industrial hygiene instruments, and group discussions. RESULTS: The results showed that the working conditions of the informal sector were improved to meet necessary standards after completing the participatory process. Also, the post-test average scores on 1) the occupational health and safety knowledge, attitudes and behaviors measures and 2) the <b>work</b> practice <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> were significantly higher than the pre-test average scores (p=sig). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the participatory approach is an effective tool to use when promoting the health safety of the informal sector and when encouraging the workers to voluntarily improve the quality of their own lives...|$|R
40|$|School {{leaders in}} Queensland, Australia, {{are working in}} a rapidly {{shifting}} policy landscape, expected to <b>work</b> towards system-defined <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> involving increasingly higher external accountabilities. This article analyses a group of long-term case studies {{of the effects of}} school improvement expectations on principals since the introduction of National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) in 2008. Foucauldian theory is used to analyse the influence of performative cultures on a group of Queensland principals. A unique feature of this geographical region is the large proportion of small-school principals, the majority of whom are {{in the early stages of}} their teaching careers. Having joined the teaching profession post-NAPLAN, the influence of these accountabilities emerges as a point of difference between them and longer-established principals. The article identifies the emergence of this new leadership paradigm as an area inviting further inquiry within the field of educational leadership research, exploring the influence of rapidly shifting expectations on leadership practices...|$|R
40|$|Whilst the Construction Industry Review Committee (CIRC) report {{highlights}} {{the room for}} improving design buildability in Hong Kong, very {{few studies have been}} conducted to examine the issues in the local context. This paper, therefore, aims to expound the current state of buildability performance in Hong Kong, and recommends strategies for needed improvements. Various indicators, including construction cost, output statistics, and the degree of involvement of construction experts in design development, have been examined. The analysis has been supplemented and confirmed through the interview of practitioners whose views echoed the CIRC’s findings that little emphasis is placed on buildability during design development. To reduce the waste of resources and the constraints due to comparatively low productivity, measures to uplift the standards of design buildability are necessary. To this end, the increased use of prefabrication and the benchmarking of building designs using a Buildability Assessment Model (BAM) are proposed. The deliberations in the formulation of the BAM have built the solid ground <b>works</b> for developing <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> to uplift the overall buildability of building designs in Hong Kong, in addition to fostering a sustainable built environment.

40|$|Recently, the {{physical}} evaluation of water environment <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> has been performed spatially in detail by the technological advance and the expanded database of Geographic Information System (GIS). Since {{it is possible}} to clarify the factor that affected water environment, if we perform the economic evaluation of water environment <b>improvement</b> <b>measures,</b> we can cope with the measures by extracting the target area and agent. Therefore, in this study, we built the basin economic assessment model based on the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model by adopting the GIS database, in order to evaluate economically the water environment <b>improvement</b> <b>measures.</b> The basin economic assessment model uses the input-output table that is made in six regions of the Nagara river basin and classifies the agriculture sectors in detail from the input-output table of Gifu prefecture that is classified into 184 sectors.

40|$|Switzerland {{has plans}} to phase out nuclear energy and reduce heat demand by {{improving}} energy efficiency and increased renewable energy use. Industrial Electric Motor Driven Systems (EMDS) offer an interesting focus area for energy efficiency improvements. EMDS consume roughly 68 % of the industrial electricity consumption globally and saving potential estimates of energy efficiency <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> vary from 8 - 15 % of the industrial electricity consumption in the EU and US. It is unknown what role energy efficiency <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> play in the Swiss context. Therefore this research has analysed the share contribution of EMDS in the Swiss industry and analysed the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> implemented in the Swiss industry. The results for the share contribution of EMDS in the Swiss context results in a 68 % share of electricity consumption of EMDS in the Swiss industry. Further three EMDS applications contribute roughly {{to a third of}} the industrial electricity consumption. Pump systems are the largest contributor with 18 %, followed by Fan systems that contribute 10 % and finally Compressed air systems contribute 5 %. The cost-effectiveness analysis was done on 195 energy efficiency <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> targeting Industrial EMDS in Switzerland. These measures were retrieved from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) program ProKilowatt (PKW), which is a subsidy incentivized program in order to stimulate the implementation of energy efficiency <b>improvement</b> <b>measures.</b> A third of the measures were identified as cost effective but also some extremely costly measures were identified. Categorizing the measures in distinguishable energy efficiency measure categories and calculating the average cost effectiveness resulted in three cost effective categories: ‘Efficient control systems for Compressed air systems’, ‘Efficient control systems for Fans’ and ‘Adding a Variable Speed Drive to a pump’. Nevertheless the results are found in a context of a lot of limitations. There is a huge spread in the cost effectiveness values of most of the categories, proper reference case is missing, Co-benefits are excluded and all measure categories are based on a limited amount of measures. Further for the complete EMDS picture this research is limited to only Pumps, Fans and Compressed air systems. In light of these limitations caution is advised for interpreting these results...|$|R
